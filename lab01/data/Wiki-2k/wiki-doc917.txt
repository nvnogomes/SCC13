Edward "Lumpy" Stevens

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edward "Lumpy" Stevens (1735 at [8]Send, Surrey [9]7 September 1819 at
   [10]Walton-on-Thames, Surrey) was an [11]English [12]cricketer,
   generally regarded as the first great bowler in the game's history. He
   was universally known by his nickname and was always called Lumpy in
   contemporary scorecards and reports, rarely Stevens.

   How he came by his legendary nickname is uncertain ^[13][1] but it may
   have been because he was adept at choosing a pitch to suit his very
   subtle variations of pace, length and direction. In those days, it was
   the leading bowler on each side who chose the place where wickets would
   be pitched and according to the famous verse:

                For honest Lumpy did allow
                He ne'er would pitch but o'er a brow ^[14][2]

   Lumpy was a gardener by trade and his bowling prowess earned him a job
   on the Walton-on-Thames estate of the [15]Earl of Tankerville, a noted
   patron of the game ^[16][2].

   The beginning of Lumpy's career was before scorecards began to kept on
   a regular basis from the [17]1772 season. He may have come from a line
   of cricketers as two Surrey players called Stevens are mentioned in
   connection with the [18]London v [19]Slindon match in the [20]1744
   season. Lumpy probably began playing in great matches around the
   mid-1750s at a time when bowlers still bowled (i.e., trundled) the ball
   all along the ground, as in crown green bowls. It is not known if Lumpy
   was the first to "give the ball air" but he was certainly around when
   that particular revolution occurred, probably before 1770. What is
   known is that Lumpy was the bowler who made the most careful study of
   flight and worked out all the implications of variations in pace,
   length and direction mentioned above. He became a master of his craft
   ^[21][3].

   It is known that in a [22]single wicket match on [23]22-23 May 1775,
   Lumpy beat the great [24]Hambledon batsman [25]John Small three times
   with the ball going through the two stump wicket of the day. As a
   result of his protests, the patrons agreed that a third stump should be
   added ^[26][2].

   Unlike the [27]Hambledon players who tended to represent their club
   only, Lumpy made appearances for just about every team, including
   Hambledon. He is normally associated with [28]Surrey teams in general
   and with the famous [29]Chertsey club in particular. He continued as a
   player until he was 50 and played his last match on [30]2-5 September
   1789 for [31]All-England v [32]Hampshire at [33]Sevenoaks Vine
   ^[34][4].
