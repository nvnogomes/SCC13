Documentary film

   Documentary film is a broad category of visual expression that is based
   on the attempt, in one fashion or another, to "[9]document" reality.
   Although "documentary film" originally referred to movies shot on
   [10]film stock, it has subsequently expanded to include [11]video and
   [12]digital productions that can be either [13]direct-to-video or made
   for a [14]television series. Documentary, as it applies here, works to
   identify a "filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of
   audience reception" that is continually evolving and is without clear
   boundaries.^[15][1]

[[39]edit] Defining documentary

   The word "documentary" was first applied to films of this nature in a
   review of [40]Robert Flaherty's film [41]Moana (1926), published in the
   [42]New York Sun on 8 February 1926 and written by "The Moviegoer", a
   pen name for documentarian [43]John Grierson.

   In the 1930s, Grierson further argued in his essay First Principles of
   Documentary that Moana had "documentary value." Grierson's principles
   of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be
   exploited in a new art form; that the "original" actor and "original"
   scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting
   the modern world; and that materials "thus taken from the raw" can be
   more real than the acted article. In this regard, Grierson's views
   align with Vertov's contempt for dramatic fiction as "bourgeois
   excess", though with considerably more subtlety. Grierson's definition
   of documentary as "creative treatment of actuality" has gained some
   acceptance, though it presents philosophical questions about
   documentaries containing stagings and reenactments.

   In his essays, [44]Dziga Vertov argued for presenting "life as it is"
   (that is, life filmed surreptitiously) and "life caught unawares" (life
   provoked or surprised by the camera).

   [45]Pare Lorentz defines a documentary film as "a [46]factual film
   which is dramatic."^[47][2] Others further state that a documentary
   stands out from the other types of non-fiction films for providing an
   opinion, and a specific message, along with the facts it
   presents.^[48][3]

   [49]Documentary Practice is the complex process of creating documentary
   projects. It refers to what people do with media devices, content,
   form, and production strategies in order to address the creative,
   ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make
   documentaries.

[[50]edit] History

[[51]edit] Pre-1900

   The filmmaker John Grierson used the term documentary in 1926 to refer
   to any nonfiction film medium, including [52]travelogues and
   instructional films.^[[53]citation needed] The earliest "moving
   pictures" were, by definition, documentaries. They were single-shot
   moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking,
   or factory workers leaving work. Early film (pre-1900) was dominated by
   the novelty of showing an event. These short films were called
   "actuality" films. (The term "documentary" was not coined until 1926.)
   Very little storytelling took place before the turn of the century, due
   mostly to technological limitations, namely, that movie cameras could
   hold only very small amounts of film. Thus, many of the first films,
   such as those made by [54]Auguste and Louis Lumire, are a minute or
   less in length,

[[55]edit] 1900-1920

   [56]Travelogue films were very popular in the early part of the 20th
   century. Some were known as "scenics". Scenics were among the most
   popular sort of films at the time.^[57][4] An important early film to
   move beyond the concept of the scenic was [58]In the Land of the Head
   Hunters (1914), which embraced [59]primitivism and [60]exoticism in a
   staged story presented as truthful re-enactments of the life of
   [61]Native Americans.

   Early color motion picture processes such as [62]Kinemacolor and
   [63]Prizmacolor used travelogues to promote the new color process. (In
   contrast, [64]Technicolor concentrated primarily on getting their
   process adopted by Hollywood studios for fictional feature films.)

   Also during this period [65]Frank Hurley's documentary film, South
   (1919), about the [66]Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, was
   released. It documented the failed Antarctic expedition led by
   [67]Ernest Shackleton in 1914.

[[68]edit] 1920s

[[69]edit] Romanticism

   [70]Nanook of the North poster.

   With [71]Robert J. Flaherty's [72]Nanook of the North in 1922,
   documentary film embraced [73]romanticism; Flaherty went on to film a
   number of heavily staged romantic films, usually showing how his
   subjects would have lived 100 years earlier and not how they lived
   right then. For instance, in Nanook of the North Flaherty did not allow
   his subjects to shoot a walrus with a nearby shotgun, but had them use
   a harpoon instead. Some of Flaherty's staging, such as building a
   roofless [74]igloo for interior shots, was done to accommodate the
   filming technology of the time.

   [75]Paramount Pictures tried to repeat the success of Flaherty's Nanook
   and Moana with two romanticized documentaries, [76]Grass (1925) and
   [77]Chang (1927), both directed by [78]Merian Cooper and [79]Ernest
   Schoedsack.

[[80]edit] The city symphony

   The continental, or realist, tradition focused on humans within
   human-made environments, and included the so-called "city symphony"
   films such as [81]Walter Ruttmann's [82]Berlin, Symphony of a City (of
   which Grierson noted in an article^[83][5] that Berlin represented what
   a documentary should not be), [84]Alberto Cavalcanti's [85]Rien Que les
   Heures, and [86]Dziga Vertov's [87]Man with the Movie Camera. These
   films tend to feature people as products of their environment, and lean
   towards the avant-garde.

[[88]edit] Kino-Pravda

   [89]Dziga Vertov was central to the [90]Soviet [91]Kino-Pravda
   (literally, "cinema truth") newsreel series of the 1920s. Vertov
   believed the camera with its varied lenses, shot-counter shot editing,
   time-lapse, ability to slow motion, stop motion and fast-motion could
   render reality more accurately than the human eye, and made a film
   philosophy out of it.

[[92]edit] Newsreel tradition

   The [93]newsreel tradition is important in documentary film; newsreels
   were also sometimes staged but were usually re-enactments of events
   that had already happened, not attempts to steer events as they were in
   the process of happening. For instance, much of the battle footage from
   the early 20th century was staged; the cameramen would usually arrive
   on site after a major battle and re-enact scenes to film them. they
   must have some snow.

[[94]edit] 1920s-1940s

   The propagandist tradition consists of films made with the explicit
   purpose of persuading an audience of a point. One of the most notorious
   [95]propaganda films is [96]Leni Riefenstahl's film [97]Triumph of the
   Will. Leftist filmmakers [98]Joris Ivens and [99]Henri Storck directed
   [100]Borinage about the Belgian coal mining region. [101]Luis Buuel
   directed a "[102]surrealist" documentary [103]Las Hurdes.

   [104]Pare Lorentz's [105]The Plow That Broke the Plains and [106]The
   River are notable [107]New Deal productions, each presenting complex
   combinations of social and ecological awareness, government propaganda,
   and leftist viewpoints. [108]Frank Capra's [109]Why We Fight series was
   a newsreel series in the United States, commissioned by the government
   to convince the U.S. public that it was time to go to war.

   In Canada the [110]Film Board, set up by [111]Grierson, was created for
   the same propaganda reasons. It also created newsreels that were seen
   by their national governments as legitimate counter-propaganda to the
   psychological warfare of [112]Nazi Germany (orchestrated by [113]Joseph
   Goebbels).

   In Britain, a number of different filmmakers came together under
   [114]John Grierson. They became known as the [115]Documentary Film
   Movement. [116]John Grierson, [117]Alberto Cavalcanti, [118]Harry Watt,
   [119]Basil Wright, and [120]Humphrey Jennings amongst others succeeded
   in blending propaganda, information, and education with a more poetic
   aesthetic approach to documentary. Examples of their work include
   Drifters ([121]John Grierson), [122]Song of Ceylon ([123]Basil Wright),
   [124]Fires Were Started and [125]A Diary for Timothy ([126]Humphrey
   Jennings). Their work involved poets such as [127]W. H. Auden,
   composers such as [128]Benjamin Britten, and writers such as [129]J. B.
   Priestley. Among the most well known films of the movement are
   [130]Night Mail and [131]Coal Face.

[[132]edit] 1950s-1970s

[[133]edit] Cinma-vrit

   [134]Cinma vrit (or the closely related [135]direct cinema) was
   dependent on some technical advances in order to exist: light, quiet
   and reliable cameras, and portable sync sound.

   Cinma vrit and similar documentary traditions can thus be seen, in a
   broader perspective, as a reaction against studio-based film production
   constraints. Shooting on location, with smaller crews, would also
   happen in the [136]French New Wave, the filmmakers taking advantage of
   advances in technology allowing smaller, handheld cameras and
   synchronized sound to film events on location as they unfolded.

   Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are
   important differences between cinma vrit ([137]Jean Rouch) and the
   North American "[138]Direct Cinema" (or more accurately "[139]Cinma
   direct", pioneered among others by French Canadian [140]Michel Brault,
   [141]Pierre Perrault, Americans [142]Robert Drew, [143]Richard Leacock,
   [144]Frederick Wiseman and [145]Albert and David Maysles).

   The directors of the movement take different viewpoints on their degree
   of involvement. Kopple and Pennebaker, for instance, choose
   non-involvement (or at least no overt involvement), and Perrault,
   Rouch, Koenig, and Kroitor favor direct involvement or even provocation
   when they deem it necessary.

   The films [146]Primary and [147]Crisis: Behind a Presidential
   Commitment (both produced by [148]Robert Drew), [149]Harlan County, USA
   (directed by [150]Barbara Kopple), [151]Dont Look Back ([152]D. A.
   Pennebaker), [153]Lonely Boy ([154]Wolf Koenig and [155]Roman Kroitor),
   [156]Chronicle of a Summer ([157]Jean Rouch) and [158]Golden Gloves
   ([159]Gilles Groulx)^[160][6]^[161][7] are all frequently deemed
   [162]cinma vrit films.

   The fundamentals of the style include following a person during a
   crisis with a moving, often handheld, camera to capture more personal
   reactions. There are no sit-down interviews, and the shooting ratio
   (the amount of film shot to the finished product) is very high, often
   reaching 80 to one. From there, editors find and sculpt the work into a
   film. The editors of the movement such as [163]Werner Nold, Charlotte
   Zwerin, Muffie Myers, Susan Froemke, and Ellen Hovde are often
   overlooked, but their input to the films was so vital that they were
   often given co-director credits.

   Famous cinma vrit/direct cinema films include [164]Les
   Raquetteurs^[165][8], Showman, Salesman, The Children Were Watching,
   Primary, Behind a Presidential Crisis, and Grey Gardens.

[[166]edit] Political weapons

   In the 1960s and 1970s, documentary film was often conceived as a
   political weapon against [167]neocolonialism and [168]capitalism in
   general, especially in [169]Latin America, but also in a changing
   [170]Quebec society. La Hora de los hornos ([171]The Hour of the
   Furnaces, from 1968), directed by [172]Octavio Getino and [173]Fernando
   E. Solanas, influenced a whole generation of filmmakers.

[[174]edit] Modern documentaries

   One of 150 DV cameras used by Iraqis to film themselves and create the
   2004 film [175]Voices of Iraq.

   [176]Box office analysts have noted that this film genre has become
   increasingly successful in theatrical release with films such as
   [177]Super Size Me, [178]March of the Penguins,and [179]An Inconvenient
   Truth among the most prominent examples. Compared to dramatic narrative
   films, documentaries typically have far lower budgets which makes them
   attractive to film companies because even a limited theatrical release
   can be highly profitable.

   The nature of documentary films has changed in the past 20 years from
   the cinema verit tradition. Landmark films such as [180]The Thin Blue
   Line by [181]Errol Morris incorporated stylized re-enactments, and
   [182]Michael Moore's [183]Roger & Me placed far more interpretive
   control with the director. Indeed, the commercial success of these
   documentaries may derive from this narrative shift in the documentary
   form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be
   called documentaries; critics sometimes refer to these works as
   "[184]mondo films" or "docu-ganda."^[185][9] However, directorial
   manipulation of documentary subjects has been noted since the work of
   Flaherty, and may be endemic to the form.

   The recent success of the documentary genre, and the advent of
   [186]DVDs, has made documentaries financially viable even without a
   cinema release. Yet funding for documentary film production remains
   elusive, and within the past decade the largest exhibition
   opportunities have emerged from within the broadcast market, making
   filmmakers beholden to the tastes and influences of the broadcasters
   who have become their largest funding source.^[187][10]

   Modern documentaries have some overlap with television forms, with the
   development of "[188]reality television" that occasionally verges on
   the documentary but more often veers to the fictional or staged. The
   making-of documentary shows how a [189]movie or a [190]computer game
   was produced. Usually made for promotional purposes, it is closer to an
   advertisement than a classic documentary.

   Modern lightweight digital video cameras and computer-based editing
   have greatly aided documentary makers, as has the dramatic drop in
   equipment prices. The first film to take full advantage of this change
   was [191]Martin Kunert and [192]Eric Manes' [193]Voices of Iraq, where
   150 DV cameras were sent to Iraq during the war and passed out to
   Iraqis to record themselves.

[[194]edit] Other documentary forms

[[195]edit] Compilation films

   Compilation films were pioneered in 1927 by [196]Esfir Schub with The
   Fall of the Romanov Dynasty. More recent examples include Point of
   Order (1964), directed by [197]Emile de Antonio about the McCarthy
   hearings and [198]The Atomic Cafe which is made entirely out of found
   footage that various agencies of the U.S. government made about the
   safety of nuclear radiation (e.g., telling troops at one point that
   it's safe to be irradiated as long as they keep their eyes and mouths
   shut). Similarly, [199]The Last Cigarette combines the testimony of
   various [200]tobacco company executives before the [201]U.S. Congress
   with archival propaganda extolling the virtues of smoking.
