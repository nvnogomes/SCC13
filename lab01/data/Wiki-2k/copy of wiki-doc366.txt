   The Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series, originally published as
   Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! (Z Sparking! ,Doragon Bru Zetto
   Supkingu!^[10]?) in [11]Japan, is a series of [12]fighting games based
   on the [13]anime and [14]manga [15]Dragon Ball by [16]Akira Toriyama.
   Each installment was developed by [17]Spike, while they were published
   by [18]Namco Bandai in Japan and [19]Atari in all other countries.

[[31]edit] Origin of name

   The "Sparking!" in the Japanese title references both the first and
   last word in the first opening theme to the [32]Dragon Ball Z [33]anime
   series, "[34]Cha-La Head-Cha-La," performed by [35]Hironobu Kageyama.
   However, the opening theme to the game is the TV series' second
   opening, "[36]We Gotta Power" (featured in the Japanese version; the
   English version includes a different, non-vocal song), which is also
   sung by Kageyama.

   The "Budokai Tenkaichi" title of the North American version is a
   rearranged version of Tenkaichi Budokai ( ,Tenka'ichi Budkai^[37]?,
   roughly "Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament"). In the
   series, the Tenka-ichi Budkai is a gathering of fighters in a
   competition for glory, fame, and prize money.

   The game is not considered a part of the Budokai series of games,
   despite its misleading title. In addition to a completely different
   game engine, the game was developed by an entirely different company
   ([38]Spike as opposed to Dimps). The game is also titled differently
   from the rest of the Budokai series in Japan. Were it a true Budokai
   game, it would have been Dragon Ball Z 4 in Japan. Speculation on the
   English re-title is that Atari chose to market the game as part of the
   Budokai series in order to capitalize on a pre-existing market of fans
   already familiar with said game series. The English version also uses a
   great deal of sound effects and background music made for the Budokai
   series.

[[39]edit] Localization differences

   Further confusing fans in North America, Atari's domestic release of
   the game does not feature the same music found in the original Japanese
   version. While Sparking! features actual music from [40]Dragon Ball Z
   (and two other pieces from the [41]Dragon Ball franchise and [42]Dragon
   Ball GT where appropriate) as composed by [43]Shunsuke Kikuchi, the
   American release of the game features recycled music from the Budokai
   series (composed in Japan by [44]Kenji Yamamoto).

   While no official explanation was ever given for the musical
   differences, as [45]FUNimation Entertainment did not use the original
   Japanese score in their "reversioning" of the TV series for an English
   dub (though they did indeed use it for their English dub of the
   original [46]Dragon Ball TV series), it can be assumed that contractual
   issues came into play.

[[47]edit] Gameplay

   [48]Super Saiyan [49]Goku using the Kamehameha against Hirudegarn in
   [50]Budokai Tenkaichi 3.

   The games are quite different from the often-compared [51]Budokai
   series; they use a "behind-the-back" camera perspective. Also different
   from the Budokai series (and more of a throw-back to games from the
   [52]Super Famicom era), each form is treated as its own character, with
   varying stats, movesets and fighting styles, similar to [53]Dragon Ball
   Z: Legendary Super Warriors while the free roam element is similar to
   [54]Dragon Ball Z: Sagas. In battle, players can build up their [55]Ki
   gauge to execute various techniques such as the Power Guard, which
   reduces the damage characters take by 1/4. The Ki gauge can also be
   used to use moves referred to as Blast 2 skills. Every character has a
   unique set of Blast 2 skills that allow the character to use special
   moves such as Ki blasts and physical attacks. Characters also have a
   self-recharging numeric gauge called Blast Stock that allows players to
   use techniques called Blast 1 skills. Blast 1 skills usually have a
   supportive effect such as allowing characters to regain health or
   immobilize the enemy. Players can also power up into a mode called Max
   Power Mode normally by building up their Ki beyond full at the cost of
   Blast Stock bars. Max Power Mode makes the character that initiated it
   faster, stronger, and able to use moves that are exclusive to the mode.
   One of these moves is the Ultimate Blast which is usually the most
   powerful move a character has, though use of any Blast 2 skill or the
   Ultimate Blast immediately ends Max Power Mode.

[[56]edit] Game Modes

   The story mode of the series (called Z Battle Gate, Dragon Adventure,
   and Dragon History in each installment, respectively) progresses
   similarly to the story modes in previous games. Players can select
   battles from different sagas and proceed through the story of
   [57]Dragon Ball to [58]Dragon Ball GT, and even several [59]Dragon Ball
   Z films. The [60]Dragon Balls can be acquired through story mode by
   destroying the environment in battle; however, the player can only keep
   the Dragon Ball they find if the battle is won. Each installment
   features several "what-if" battles and scenarios; for example, the
   Tenkaichi 1 story mode features modes where the player takes control of
   a villain and uses the character to defeat the hero, while the
   Tenkaichi 2 story mode has modes where [61]Raditz and [62]Zarbon
   essentially team up with the Z Fighters for one reason or another.
   Several levels of the Tenkaichi 2 story mode also feature cutscenes
   shown either before or after the fight of the level takes place. The
   Tenkaichi 3 story mode has cutscenes integrated into the battles
   themselves that are activated by hitting a certain button. These can be
   transformations, character changes, automatic attack use, or something
   as simple as a conversation.

   Similar to the same mode in the Budokai series, the player can enter a
   World Tournament and try to win their way to the top. There are three
   levels of the basic tournament and a Cell Games mode (which is hosted
   by [63]Cell). Since characters can fly, characters can leave the
   perimeter of the arena, but will be called for ringout if they touch
   the ground. There are no restrictions to the Cell Games mode, but the
   last match of the Cell Games mode is always against Perfect Cell. In
   Tenkaichi 1 winning the tournaments gave players a Z-Item prize while
   in Tenkaichi 2, players would receive money which in turn would be used
   on Z-Items. The World Tournament mode could be played with several
   entrants, but if there is more than one human player, no prize would be
   awarded. Other features in the game includes more combo attacks or
   character specific combos, the Blast Combos, and the Z Burst Dash. The
   additional combo attacks will be able to help chain in more attacks for
   more damage and longer combos. The Blast Combo is the normal combos
   however by inputting the another button into the attack will allow you
   to use a blast attack for extra damage. Depending on the moves of the
   character you might not be able to use this feat such as Videl or
   Hercule. The Z Burst Dash is much faster and more evasive version of
   the of the Dragon Dash. It allows the user to get behind the opponent
   at high speeds for either a strike or to avoid a blast 2 attack. The
   drawback to this technique is that it will rapidly drain you of energy.

[[64]edit] History

[[65]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi

   Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi, originally published as Dragon Ball
   Z: Sparking! (Z Sparking! ,Doragon Bru Zetto Supkingu!^[66]?) in
   [67]Japan, is the first installment in the Budokai Tenkaichi series.
   The game is available only on [68]Sony's [69]PlayStation 2. It was
   released in Japan on [70]October 6, [71]2005, [72]North America on
   [73]October 18, [74]2005, and [75]Europe on [76]October 21, [77]2005.
   It is now a Greatest Hits title.

   The game features 20 playable characters in 90 forms and 16 stages for
   battle. However, this game is the only one in the series to not allow
   in-game transformations.

   Despite not featuring the original Japanese music, the American release
   of the game allows for selectable English ([78]FUNimation Productions
   cast) and Japanese voices, while retaining the English-language written
   dialogue (as adapted from Steven J. Simmons' translation from the
   original Japanese version's script). However, there are known bugs in
   the American version of Budokai Tenkaichi that cause pieces of English
   and Japanese spoken dialogue to cross over into whichever selection the
   player is using at times.

[[79]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2

   Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2, originally published as Dragon Ball
   Z: Sparking! NEO (Z Sparking! NEO ,Doragon Bru Zetto Supkingu!
   Neo^[80]?) in [81]Japan, is the second installment in the Budokai
   Tenkaichi series. The game is available on both [82]Sony's
   [83]PlayStation 2 and [84]Nintendo's [85]Wii. The PlayStation 2 and Wii
   versions have different dates of release. It was released on the
   PlayStation 2 in Japan on [86]October 5, [87]2006, Europe on
   [88]November 3, [89]2006, North America on [90]November 7, [91]2006,
   and Australia on [92]November 9, [93]2006. The Wii version had slightly
   later releases; it was released in North America on [94]November 19,
   [95]2006, Japan on [96]January 1, [97]2007, Europe on [98]March 30,
   [99]2007, and Australia on [100]April 5, [101]2007. It is now a
   Greatest Hits title, like its predecessor. Though originally confirmed
   as being a launch title in North America for the Wii,^[102][1] some
   stores started selling the Wii version on November 15 2006. An issue of
   [103]V-Jump listed January 2007 as the release date for the Japanese
   version of the Wii release. The game originally featured 129 characters
   and 16 stages, though the Japanese and [104]PAL Wii versions came with
   five additional characters and an extra stage as compensation of their
   late releases.

   Some additionally great bonus material within the game was the special
   story modes specifically given to [105]Zarbon and [106]Raditz, whom
   were attentively treated particularly well with their own game modes,
   unlike any other characters. One element of Tenkaichi 2 that is absent
   from Tenkaichi 1 and Tenkaichi 3 is that the story mode allows the
   player to fly around the Earth, which was also featured in [107]Dragon
   Ball Z: Budokai 3.

[[108]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3

   Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, originally published as Dragon Ball
   Z: Sparking! METEOR (Z Sparking! METEOR ,Doragon Bru Zetto Supkingu!
   Meteo^[109]?) in [110]Japan, is the third installment in the Budokai
   Tenkaichi series. The game is available on both [111]Sony's
   [112]PlayStation 2 and [113]Nintendo's [114]Wii.^[115][2] The game was
   released in Japan on [116]October 4, [117]2007,^[118][3] in [119]North
   America on [120]November 13, [121]2007^[122][4] and in [123]Europe on
   [124]November 9, [125]2007 (on PlayStation 2, the Wii version's release
   date is [126]December 3, [127]2007 in North America, [128]October 4,
   [129]2007 in Japan, and [130]February 15, [131]2008 in
   Europe).^[132][5]

   Tenkaichi 3 features over 162 characters, the largest character roster
   in any Dragon Ball Z game, as well as one of the largest in any
   fighting game. Ryo Mito once stated that the game would feature
   never-before-seen characters made exclusively for the game, although
   the only exclusive characters were the saiyans turning into big
   apes.^[133][6] [134]Gamestop offered an exclusive version with a bonus
   DVD containing the top 10 television series battles as voted by fans on
   the release date.^[[135]citation needed]

   Several new notable features include: Battle Replay, night and day
   stages, the Wii's online capability, and Disc Fusion. Battle Replay
   allows players to capture their favorite fights and save them to an SD
   card to view later on. Night and day stages allow for more accurate
   battles in Dragon Ball History, as well as the ability to transform
   into a [136]Great Ape by using the [137]moon. There are also several
   other time differences, such as dawn and afternoon. Not all stages
   provide different times. You can also change the aura of your
   character. The Wii version features online multiplayer
   capability,^[138][2] the first game in the series to have such a
   feature. Players can fight against anyone from around the globe with a
   ranking system showing the player's current standing compared to anyone
   else who has played online. As compensation for the lack of online,
   [139]Spike has added a new "Disc Fusion System" to the [140]PlayStation
   2 version. Inserting a Tenkaichi 1 or Tenkaichi 2 disc during play
   unlocks Ultimate Battle or Ultimate Battle Z,^[141][2] modes featured
   in the respective games needed to unlock them. The game also supports
   480p for both the Wii and the PlayStation 2 versions.

   Other features in the game includes more combo attacks or character
   specific combos, the Blast Combos, and the Z Burst Dash. The additional
   combo attacks will be able to help chain in more attacks for more
   damage and longer combos. The Blast Combos are normal combos used in
   the game, however by inputting the another button into the attack will
   allow you to use a blast attack for extra damage. Depending on the
   moves of the character you might not be able to use this feat such as
   Videl or Hercule. The Z Burst Dash is much faster and more evasive
   version of the Dragon Dash. It allows the user to get behind the
   opponent at high speeds for either a strike or to avoid a blast 2
   attack. The drawback to this technique is that it will rapidly drain
   you of energy.

[[278]edit] Reception

   Critical reaction for the Budokai Tenkaichi series has been mixed.
   Numerous reviews praised the game's high fighter count and detailed
   [279]cel-shaded graphics, as well as the high amount of [280]fan
   service to Dragon Ball Z fans. Some people, however, have taken issue
   with the game's complex controls. [281]Mark Bozon at [282]IGN said,
   "The sheer speed and complexity of the controls may turn some people
   off, but the general combat will eventually come down to two buttons,
   making the game amazingly easy to learn, but nearly impossible to fully
   master."

   The PS2 version of Tenkaichi 2 received the 'Best Fighting Game of the
   Year' award from [283]X-Play and the Wii version of the game also
   received a four out of five from X-Play. The game magazine [284]Famitsu
   gave the PS2 version of Tenkaichi 3 a 32 out of 40, while the Wii
   version received a 33 out of 40. IGN awarded both versions of Tenkaichi
   3 an 8 out of 10, with their only complaints being the comparatively
   underwhelming story mode (in comparison to Tenkaichi 2), gimmicky Disc
   Fusion and the lagging Wi-Fi.^[285][9]
