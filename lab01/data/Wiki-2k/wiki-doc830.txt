   Captain Edward "Ned" Low, also Lowe or Loe, (c. 1690 c. 1724) was a
   notorious English [20]pirate during the latter days of the [21]Golden
   Age of Piracy, in the early 18th century. He was born around 1690 into
   poverty in [22]Westminster, [23]London, and was a thief and a scoundrel
   from a young age. Low moved to [24]Boston, [25]Massachusetts, as a
   young man. His wife died in childbirth in late 1719. Two years later,
   he became a pirate, operating off the coasts of [26]New England and the
   [27]Azores, and in the [28]Caribbean.

   He captained a number of ships, usually maintaining a small fleet of
   three or four. Low and his pirate crews captured at least a hundred
   ships during his short career, burning most of them.^[29][1] Although
   he was active for only three years, Low remains notorious as one of the
   most vicious pirates of the age, with a reputation for violently
   torturing his victims before killing them.^[30][2] Sir [31]Arthur Conan
   Doyle described Low as "savage and desperate," and a man of "amazing
   and grotesque brutality".^[32][3] [33]The New York Times called him a
   torturer, whose methods would have "done credit to the ingenuity of the
   [34]Spanish Inquisition in its darkest days".^[35][4] The circumstances
   of Low's death, which took place around 1724, have been the subject of
   much speculation.

[[51]edit] Early life

   According to [52]Charles Johnson's [53]A General History of the
   Pyrates, Edward Low was born in [54]Westminster, [55]London, England,
   around 1690.^[56][5] He was described as illiterate, having a
   "quarrelsome nature", and always ready to cheat,^[57][6] running "wild
   in the streets of his native parish".^[58][7] As a young man, he was
   said to be a [59]pickpocket and gambler, playing games of chance with
   the footmen of the nearby [60]House of Commons.^[61][5]

   Most of his family appear to have been thieves. While young and small
   for his age, his brother is said to have been carried around in a
   basket on a friend's back. In a crowd, Low's brother would snatch the
   hats and [62]wigs of passers-by. The brother later took to other forms
   of criminal activity and ended up [63]hanged at [64]Tyburn for
   "[65]thievery".^[66][5]^[67][7]

[[68]edit] Life in Boston

   As he grew older, Low tired of pickpocketing and thievery, and turned
   to [69]burglary. Eventually, he left England, and travelled alone to
   the [70]New World around 1710. He spent three to four years in various
   locations, before settling in [71]Boston, [72]Massachusetts.^[73][7] On
   12 August 1714, he married Eliza Marble at the First Church of
   Boston.^[74][8] They had a son, who died when he was an infant, and
   then a daughter named Elizabeth, born in the winter of 1719.^[75][7]

   Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low with his daughter.^[76][5] The
   loss of his wife had a profound effect on Low: in his later career of
   piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind,
   and refused to [77]press-gang married men into joining his
   crews.^[78][7] He would also allow women to return to port
   safely.^[79][9] At first working honestly as a [80]rigger, in early
   1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a [81]sloop headed for
   [82]Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for
   resale in Boston.^[83][5]^[84][6]

   Low was employed as a patron, supervising the loading and carrying of
   the logs. One day, he returned to the ship when hungry, but was told by
   the captain he would have to wait to eat, and that he and his men would
   have to be satisfied with a ration of [85]rum. At this, Low "took up a
   loaded musket and fired at the captain but missed him, [and] shot
   another poor fellow through the throat".^[86][10] Following this failed
   [87]mutiny, Low and his friends were forced to leave the boat. A day
   later, Low led the twelve-man gangwhich included [88]Francis Farrington
   Spriggs, who went on to become a notorious pirate in his own rightin
   taking over a small sloop off the coast of Rhode Island. Killing one
   man during the theft, Low and his crew turned pirate, determined "to go
   in her, make a black Flag and declare War against all the
   World."^[89][5]^[90][4]

[[91]edit] Piracy

[[92]edit] Lieutenant

   Low, using his newly captured ship, lay in wait on the popular shipping
   route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew
   seized a sloop out of Rhode Island, and plundered it. His crew cut the
   rigging away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to
   raise the alarm.^[93][6] He then captured a number of unarmed
   [94]merchantmen near Port Rosemary.^[95][11]

   Of all the pyratical crews that were ever heard of, none of the English
       name came up to this, in barbarity. Their mirth and their anger had
      much the same effect, for both were usually gratified with the cries
    and groans of their prisoners; so that they almost as often murdered a
     man from the excess of good humour, as out of passion and resentment;
       and the unfortunate could never be assured of safety from them, for
                                       danger lurked in their very smiles.

                   [96]Philip Ashton on his time with Low's crew.^[97][12]

   Low headed south and began operating in the waters of the [98]Grand
   Caymans, with a period as [99]lieutenant to the established pirate
   [100]George Lowther, who captained the Happy
   Delivery,^[101][1]^[102][11] a 100-[103]ton Rhode Island sloop with
   eight [104]cannon and ten swivel guns. When she was "destroyed by
   Indians" (given the location, these were almost certainly [105]Tano,
   inhabitants of the [106]Greater Antilles, which included the Caymans),
   Lowther and his crew transferred to a sloop named the Ranger. Lowther's
   crew was constantly expanded by desperate sailors willing to join
   him.^[107][13] Fast acquiring a taste for cruelty, Low taught Spriggs a
   torture technique which involved tying a victim's hands with rope
   between their fingers and setting it alight, burning their flesh down
   to the bones.^[108][10]

   Following a number of successful raids, Lowther eventually captured a
   large 6-gun [109]brigantine (named Rebecca) on 28 May 1722.^[110][5] He
   gave it to Low to captain. With a crew of 44, Low amicably dissolved
   his partnership with Lowther.^[111][11]

[[112]edit] Pirate captain

   In one notable raid in June 1722, Low and his crew attacked thirteen
   New England fishing vessels sheltering at anchor in Port Roseway,
   [113]Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Although outnumbered, Low hoisted his
   [114]Jolly Roger flag and declared that no mercy would be given to the
   fishermen if any resisted. The fleet submitted and Low's men robbed
   every vessel. Low chose the largest, an 80-ton [115]schooner which he
   renamed The Fancy and armed with 10 guns, to become his
   [116]flagship.^[117][1]

   He sank the other ships of the fleet, and abandoned the Rebecca. The
   Boston News Letter of 9 July 1722 published a list of those captured by
   Low.^[118][12] A number of the fishermen were [119]forced to join Low,
   including [120]Philip Ashton who escaped in May 1723 on [121]Roatn
   Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and who wrote a detailed account
   of life aboard Low's pirate ship.^[122][1]^[123][14] Before Ashton's
   escape, he had been beaten, whipped, kept in chains, and threatened
   with death many times, as he refused to sign Low's articles and become
   a pirate.^[124][15]

   Low's tactics consisted primarily of hoisting [125]false colours and
   approaching an unsuspecting vessel.^[126][10] Off the coast of [127]St
   John's, [128]Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed [129]man of war
   for a fishing boat, and barely escaped.^[130][14] He moved on to
   [131]Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the [132]Grand
   Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the
   [133]Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguesesources differ)
   [134]pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and
   refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink.^[135][16] He
   also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard.
   Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the
   [136]yard arm several times, until they died.^[137][4] He moved on to
   the [138]Canaries, [139]Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of
   [140]Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.^[141][14]

   Captain Loe, with the usual Compliments, welcomed me on board, and told
      me, He was very sorry for my Loss, and that it was not his Desire to
   meet with any of his Country-men, but rather with Foreigners, excepting
         some few that he wanted to chastise for their Rogueishness, as he
                                                                call'd it.

        Captain George Roberts (actually [142]Daniel Defoe) on a fictional
                                               meeting with Low.^[143][17]

   Low abandoned his plans for plundering the rich shipping trade off the
   coast of Brazil, and moved on to the Caribbean. George Roberts, a mate
   on the British ship King Sagamore, recounted a meeting with Low aboard
   the Pink. Roberts' ship was captured by Low's fleet, of which he was
   now styling himself "Commodore".^[144][16]

[[145]edit] Capsizing of the Rose Pink

   Forty [146]leagues (120 [147]nautical miles or around 220 km) to the
   east of [148]Surinam, Low and his fleet of two ships (the Rose Pink and
   the Fancy, captained by a young [149]Charles Harris) dropped anchor to
   remove growth such as [150]seaweed and [151]barnacles from the outside
   of the boats, in a process known as [152]careening, necessary because
   no [153]dry dock was available to pirates. Still relatively
   inexperienced, Low ordered too many men to the outside of the boat to
   work on the buildup, and the Rose Pink tipped over too far. The
   [154]portholes had been left open, and the vessel took on water and
   sank, with the death of two men. The Pink had been carrying most of the
   provisions, and Lowby now captaining a captured [155]schooner, the
   Squirreland his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water
   to half a [156]pint (around 275 [157]ml) per man, per day.^[158][18]

   Failing to reach their initial destination of [159]Tobago due to light
   winds and strong [160]currents, Low's depleted fleet made it to
   [161]Grenada, a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks,
   he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a
   French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's
   men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop
   (renamed the Ranger), gave the schooner Squirrel to his
   [162]quartermaster, [163]Spriggs, who renamed it the Delight before
   sailing away in the middle of the night with a small crew following a
   disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs'
   crew.^[164][19]

[[165]edit] Early 1723

        The Pyrates [were] waiting there for them, took them and Plundered
         them; they cut and whiped some and others they burnt with Matches
        between their Fingers to the bone to make them confess where their
             Money was, they took to the value of a Thousand Pistoles from
     Passengers and others, they then let them go, but coming on the Coast
          off of the Capes of Virginia, they were again chased by the same
   Pyrates who first took them, they did not trouble them again but wished
   them well Home, they saw at the same time his Consort, a Sloop of eight
      Guns, with a Ship and a Sloop which were supposed to be Prizes, they
   were Commanded by one Edward LOW. The Pyrates gave us an account of his
    taking the Bay of Hondoras from the Spaniards, which had surprised the
       English and taking them, and putting all the Spaniards to the Sword
           Excepting two boys, as also burning The King George, and a Snow
     belonging to New York, and sunk one of the New England Ships, and cut
       off one the Masters Ears and slit his Nose, all this they confessed
                                                               themselves.

                     The American Weekly Mercury, 6 June13, 1723^[166][20]

   The new fleet captured many more sloops, including one Low kept, naming
   it the Fortune. During a trial on 10 July 1723 for a number of Low's
   crew, a sailor on board the Fortune named John Welland recalled how Low
   stripped his boat, including gold to the value of 150, then beat him
   and cut off his ear with a [167]cutlass.^[168][21]

   Following this, Low's fleet captured a [169]Portuguese ship called the
   Nostra Signiora de Victoria on 25 January 1723. The Victoria's
   Portuguese captain allowed a bag containing approximately 11,000 gold
   [170]moidores (worth at the time around 15,000) to fall into the sea
   rather than see it captured.^[171][18] One of Low's most noted episodes
   of cruelty followed: in his rage, he slashed off the Portuguese
   captain's lips with a cutlass, [172]broiled them, and forced the victim
   to eat them while still hot.^[173][6]^[174][18] He then murdered the
   remaining crew.^[175][1] Low's own men described him as "a maniac and a
   brute".^[176][15]
   The Cruelties practised by Captain Low, from A Pirate's Own Book (1837)

   A story describes Low burning a French cook alive, saying he was a
   "greasy fellow who would fry well", and another tells he once killed 53
   Spanish captives with his [177]cutlass.^[178][6] Some historians,
   including [179]David Cordingly, believe this was deliberately done to
   cultivate a ferocious image.^[180][22] Historian Edward Leslie
   described Low as a [181]psychopath with a history filled with
   "mutilations, disembowelings, decapitations, and slaughter".^[182][12]
   Low, like other pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims
   into surrendering, by threatening to kill or torture them. The crew of
   the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so
   afraid were they of reprisals.^[183][23] One failed [184]torture
   session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in
   the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.^[185][5]

   A [186]snow called the Unity was added to the fleet, and used as a
   [187]tender, but was abandoned during an encounter with a man of war
   named the Mermaid.^[188][1] As Low's success increased in the
   [189]Caribbean, so did his notoriety. Eventually, a [190]bounty was
   placed on his head, and Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up
   with [191]Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure
   increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of
   Edward Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the
   time.^[192][6]

[[193]edit] Death

   (1837)

   Low, Harris and their ships left the Azores for the [194]Carolinas. On
   10 June 1723, they suffered a resounding defeat in a battle with
   [195]HMS Greyhound, a heavily armed man of war.^[196][11] The Greyhound
   had been dispatched under the command of Peter Solgard to hunt down Low
   and his fleet. Low fled in the Fancy with a [197]skeleton crew and
   150,000 on board^[198][9] and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris
   and the Ranger behind.^[199][6] Twenty-five of the crew of the Ranger,
   including the ship's doctor, were tried between 10 July and 12 July,
   with Solgard giving evidence and recounting the battle.^[200][21] The
   men were hanged for felony, piracy and robbery, near [201]Newport,
   [202]Rhode Island, on 19 July 1723.^[203][1]^[204][11] Harris was sent
   back to England and hanged at [205]Wapping.^[206][24] When Solgard
   returned to New York, he was presented with the [207]freedom of the
   city and a gold [208]snuffbox for his part in bringing some of Low's
   crew to justice.^[209][9]

   Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He captured a whaling
   vessel 80 miles (130 km) out at sea, and in a foul mood following the
   encounter with the Greyhound and the loss of his right hand man,
   Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He
   set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to
   starve to death (they were lucky, and reached Nantucket after a
   difficult journey).^[210][4] Remaining off the coast of North America,
   his crew took a fishing boat near [211]Block Island. Low decapitated
   the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more
   fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew
   refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.^[212][4]

   Heading south again, Low captured a 22-gun French ship and a large
   [213]Virginian merchant vessel, the Merry Christmas, in late June 1723.
   Following the defeat by the Greyhound, Low became "peculiarly cruel" to
   his English victims.^[214][9] His fleet of three ships rejoined forces
   with [215]George Lowther in July. In late 1723, Low and Lowther's fleet
   captured the Delight off the coast of [216]Guinea, mounting fourteen
   guns on her, with command being given to Spriggs. Two days later,
   Spriggs and Lowther both abandoned Low, leaving him the Merry
   Christmas, by now mounted with 34 guns, as his sole ship.^[217][5]

   There are conflicting reports on the circumstances of Edward Low's
   death. [218]Charles Johnsonconsidered by some to be [219]Daniel Defoe
   writing under a [220]pseudonym^[221][25]stated in his [222]A General
   History of the Pyrates, at odds with other sources, that Edward Low and
   the Fancy were last sighted near the [223]Canaries and [224]Guinea but
   at the time of his 1724 book, no further reports had surfaced. He noted
   one rumour that Low was sailing for Brazil and another that Low's ship
   sank in a storm with the loss of all hands.^[225][5] The [226]National
   Maritime Museum in London states that he was never caught, ending his
   days in [227]Brazil.^[228][2]

   The Pirates Own Book and Ossian both suggest that Low was set adrift
   without provisions by the crew of the Merry Christmas, in a [229]mutiny
   brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an
   argument.^[230][13] Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when
   the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial,
   and was hanged in [231]Martinique, in 1724.^[232][6]

[[233]edit] Flags

   The [234]pirate flag used by Edward Low

   Initially, Low used the same [235]flag as [236]Edward Teach
   ("Blackbeard"). Later, he used his own flag, a red [237]skeletal figure
   on a black background, which became notorious.^[238][26] He first flew
   his own flag in late July 1723.^[239][5]

   Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a
   trumpet; this Green Trumpeter was hoisted on the [240]mizzen peak to
   call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.^[241][1]

[[242]edit] Articles

   Low had a set of [243]Articles, a [244]code of conduct and an ironic
   reference to the Royal Navy's own [245]Articles of War.^[246][21] The
   Articles listed below are attributed to Low by the [247]Boston
   News-Letter. The first eight of these articles are essentially
   identical to those attributed to [248]Lowther by Defoe.^[249][5]

   It is likely that both reports are correct and that Low and Lowther
   shared the same articles, with Low's two extra articles being an
   [250]ordonnance, or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated.

   I. The Captain is to have two full Shares; the [Quarter] Master is to
   have one Share and one Half; The Doctor, Mate, Gunner and
   [251]Boatswain, one Share and one Quarter.

   II. He that shall be found guilty of taking up any Unlawfull Weapon on
   Board the Privateer or any other prize by us taken, so as to Strike or
   Abuse one another in any regard, shall suffer what Punishment the
   Captain and the Majority of the Company shall see fit.

   III. He that shall be found Guilty of Cowardice in the time of
   Ingagements, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority
   of the Company shall think fit.

   IV. If any Gold, Jewels, Silver, &c. be found on Board of any Prize or
   Prizes to the value of a [252]Piece of Eight, & the finder do not
   deliver it to the Quarter Master in the space of 24 hours he shall
   suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company
   shall think fit.

   V. He that is found Guilty of Gaming, or Defrauding one another to the
   value of a Royal of Plate, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and
   the Majority of the Company shall think fit.

   VI. He that shall have the Misfortune to loose a Limb in time of
   Engagement, shall have the Sum of Six hundred pieces of Eight, and
   remain aboard as long as he shall think fit.

   VII. Good Quarters to be given when Craved.

   VIII. He that sees a Sail first, shall have the best Pistol or Small
   Arm aboard of her.

   IX. He that shall be guilty of Drunkenness in time of Engagement shall
   suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall
   think fit.

   X. No Snaping of Guns in the [253]Hould.

[[254]edit] Legacy

   Artist's impression of Ned Low by Marc Davis in 1962, now on the
   [255]Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride at [256]Disneyland

   Edward Low's acts, along with those of other pirates of the period such
   as [257]Edward Teach, [258]Bartholomew Roberts ("Black Bart"), and
   [259]William Fly, led to a great increase in the military presence to
   protect shipping lanes, resulting in the effective end of the
   [260]Golden Age of Piracy.^[261][23]

   By 1700, the European states had enough troops and ships at their
   disposal, following the end of a number of wars, to begin better
   protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the
   Americas, without relying on the aid of [262]privateers. [263]Pirates
   based in the Caribbean were chased from the seas by a new British
   [264]Royal Navy squadron based at [265]Port Royal, [266]Jamaica and a
   smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the [267]Spanish
   Main, known as the Guarda de Costa (Coast Guard in English), or simply
   the Guarda.^[268][6]^[269][23]

   Less is recorded of Low than of other equally prolific pirates such as
   Teach and [270]Stede Bonnet. [271]Howard Pyle, in an 1880 children's
   book on pirates, said: "No one stood higher in the trade than [Low],
   and no one mounted to more lofty altitudes of bloodthirsty and
   unscrupulous wickedness. 'Tis strange that so little has been written
   and sung of this man of might, for he was as worthy of story and of
   song as was Blackbeard."^[272][27] Sir [273]Arthur Conan Doyle, in his
   work The Green Flag, described Low as "savage and desperate", and a man
   of "amazing and grotesque brutality".^[274][3] The [275]New York Times
   said "Low and his crew became the terror of the Atlantic, and his
   depredations were committed on every part of the ocean, from the coast
   of Brazil to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland".^[276][4]

   Low has featured on stamps and commemorative currency around the
   Caribbean. A [277]postage stamp featuring Low was [278]commissioned by
   the [279]Cayman Islands in 1975,^[280][28] and in 1994 the government
   of [281]Antigua and Barbuda featured Edward Low and his brigantine,
   Rebecca, on a legal tender one hundred-[282]dollar bill made of
   [283]gold leaf.^[284][29]

   "Ned Low" is one of the pirates featured on the [285]Pirates of the
   Caribbean ride at [286]Disneyland in [287]California. A duplicate of
   Low's flag was used for the flag of the fictional pirate, [288]Sao
   Feng, in Disney's [289]Pirates of the Caribbean films.^[290][30]

   Some of Low's haunts, such as the waters around the [291]Isles of
   Shoals off New Hampshire and Isle Haute in [292]Nova Scotia, attract
   [293]treasure hunters who seek artifacts in the ships he
   sank.^[294][31]^[295][32]
