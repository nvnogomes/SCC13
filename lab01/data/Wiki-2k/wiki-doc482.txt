[[61]edit] Overview

   Duke Energy owns and operates 36,000 [62]megawatts of base-load and
   peak generation that it distributes to its 4 million customers. Duke
   Energy's service territory covers 47,000 square miles (120,000 km^2)
   with 106,000 miles (171,000 km) of distribution lines.^[63][2] Almost
   all of Duke Energy's Midwest generation comes from coal, natural gas or
   oil, while half of its Carolinas generation comes from its [64]nuclear
   power plants. During 2006, Duke Energy generated 148,798,332
   megawatt-hours of electrical energy.

   Duke Energy Generation Services (DEGS), a subsidiary of Duke Energy,
   specializes in the development, ownership and operation of various
   generation facilities throughout the United States. This segment of the
   company operates 6,600 megawatts of generation. 240 megawatts of
   [65]wind generation were under construction and 1,500 additional
   megawatts of wind generation were in planning stages.^[66][3] On
   September 9, 2008, DEGS updated its projections for future wind power
   capacity. By the end of 2008, it would have over 500 MW of
   [67]nameplate capacity of wind power online, and an additional 5,000 MW
   in development.^[68][4]

[[69]edit] History

   The company began in 1900 as the Catawba Power Company when [70]Dr.
   Walker Gill Wylie and his brother financed the building of a
   hydroelectric power station at India Hook Shoals along the Catawba
   River. In need of additional funding to further his ambitious plan for
   construction of a series of hydroelectric power plants, Wylie convinced
   [71]James Buchanan Duke to invest in the Southern Power Company,
   founded in 1905, which later became known as Duke Power.

   Prior to the 1960s, Duke Power was not accepting of [72]African
   American employees.^[73][5] After the [74]Civil Rights Act of 1965,
   Duke Power switched to a merit-based system of employment that required
   a high school education or a minimum score on an [75]IQ test. This new
   policy had the de facto effect of maintaining a primarily white
   workforce.^[76][5] The [77]NAACP Legal Defense Fund brought a lawsuit
   against Duke Power, supported by the [78]Department of Justice. A March
   1971 [79]Supreme Court ruling, [80]Griggs v. Duke Power Company, found
   that Duke Power could not continue the merit-based system:
   "[P]ractices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face and even
   neutral in terms of intent cannot be maintained if they operate to
   'freeze' the status quo of prior discriminatory employment
   practices."^[81][5]

   In 1988, Nantahala Power & Light Co., which served southwestern North
   Carolina, was purchased by Duke and is now operated under the Duke
   Power - Nantahala Area brand. Duke Power merged with PanEnergy in 1997
   to form Duke Energy. The Duke Power name continued as the electric
   utility business of Duke Energy until the Cinergy merger.
   Duke Energy Field Services near [82]Palestine, Texas. The facilities
   include refineries and oil wells throughout the region.

   With the purchase of [83]Cinergy Corporation announced in 2005 and
   completed on [84]April 3, [85]2006, Duke Energy Corporation's customer
   base now includes the [86]Midwestern United States as well. The company
   operates [87]nuclear power plants, coal-fired plants, conventional
   [88]hydroelectric plants, natural-gas turbines to handle peak demand,
   and pumped hydro storage. During 2006, Duke Energy also acquired
   [89]Chatham, Ontario-based [90]Union Gas, which is regulated under the
   Ontario Energy Board Act (1998).

   On January 3, 2007, Duke Energy spun off its gas business to form
   [91]Spectra Energy. Duke Energy shareholders received 1 share of
   Spectra Energy for each 2 shares of Duke Energy. After the spin-off,
   Duke Energy now receives the majority of its revenue from its electric
   operations in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky,
   Ohio, and Indiana. The spinoff to Spectra also included Union Gas,
   which Duke Energy acquired the previous year.

[[92]edit] New nuclear power plant

          Main article: [93]William States Lee III Nuclear Generating
          Station

   On March 16, 2006 [94]Duke Power announced that a [95]Cherokee County,
   SC site had been selected for a potential new [96]nuclear power plant.
   The site is jointly owned by Duke Power and [97]Southern Company. Duke
   plans to develop the site for two [98]Westinghouse Electric Company
   [99]AP1000 (advanced passive) [100]pressurized water reactors. Each
   reactor is capable of producing approximately 1,117 megawatts. (See
   [101]Nuclear Power 2010 Program.)

   On December 14, 2007 [102]Duke Power submitted a [103]Combined
   Construction and Operating License to the [104]Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission, with an announcement that it will spend $160 million in
   2008 on the plant with a total cost of 5-6 billion dollars.^[105][6]

   This site will be adjacent to the old site which was never completed
   and abandoned in the early '80s, and used by [106]James Cameron as a
   film set for the 1989 movie [107]The Abyss.

[[108]edit] Environmental record

   In 1999 the [109]United States [110]Environmental Protection Agency
   commenced an enforcement action against Duke Energy for failure to
   comply with the [111]Clean Air Act. Duke asserted that EPA regulations
   under the law were arbitrarily changed over the course of 25 years.
   Environmental groups assert that Duke is using loopholes in the law to
   increase emissions. Initially, Duke prevailed at the trial court level,
   but in 2006 the case was argued before the [112]Supreme Court
   ([113]Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp. (05-848)). The Court
   unanimously ruled on [114]April 2, [115]2007 against Duke Energy in
   favor of the environmental groups.^[116][7]

   In 2002, researchers at the [117]University of Massachusetts Amherst
   have identified Duke Energy as the 46th-largest corporate producer of
   [118]air pollution in the United States, with roughly 36 million pounds
   of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.^[119][8] Major
   pollutants indicated by the study include [120]sulfuric and
   [121]hydrochloric acid, [122]chromium compounds, and [123]hydrogen
   fluoride.^[124][9] In 2008 Duke Energy rose to the 13th position in the
   list, more than doubling its release of toxic chemicals to 80 million
   pounds per year.^[125][10]

   (June 2008)

   In early 2008, Duke Energy announced plans to build the new,
   800-megawatt Cliffside coal plant 55 miles (89 km) West of Charlotte,
   North Carolina. The plans have been strongly opposed by various
   environmental groups such as Rising Tide North America, Rainforest
   Action Network, the community based Canary Coalition as well as The
   Southern Environmental Law Center which has threatened to sue them if
   they do not halt plans for construction. On April 1st, activists locked
   themselves down to machinery at the Cliffside construction area as part
   of [131]Fossil Fools Day. In May 2008, Duke CEO, James Rogers, was
   grilled by his own shareholders who questioned the company's reliance
   on coal and involvement with the controversial mountain top removal
   coal mining in Appalachia.
