   (disambiguation).

   In [25]classical mythology, Dionysus or Dionysos (in [26]Greek, or ;
   IPA: [27]/danass/), is the [28]god of [29]wine, the inspirer of ritual
   madness and [30]ecstasy, and a major figure of [31]Greek mythology, and
   one of the twelve Olympians, among whom [32]Greek mythology treated
   Dionysus as a late arrival. The geographical origins of his cult were
   unknown to the classical Greeks, but almost all myths depicted him as
   having "foreign" origins: typical of the god of the epiphany, "the god
   that comes".

   He was also known as Bacchus^[33][1] and the frenzy he induces,
   bakkheia. He is the patron deity of [34]agriculture and the
   [35]theatre. He was also known as the Liberator ([36]Eleutherios),
   freeing one from one's normal self, by madness, ecstasy, or
   wine.^[37][2] The divine mission of Dionysus was to mingle the music of
   the [38]aulos and to bring an end to care and worry.^[39][3] Scholars
   have discussed Dionysus' relationship to the "cult of the souls" and
   his ability to preside over communication between the living and the
   dead.^[40][4]

   In Greek mythology, Dionysus is made to be a son of [41]Zeus and
   [42]Semele; other versions of the [43]myth contend that he is a son of
   Zeus and [44]Persephone. He is described as being womanly or
   "man-womanish".^[45][5]

   The name Dionysos is of uncertain significance; its -nysos element may
   well be non-Greek in origin, but its dio- element has been associated
   since antiquity with Zeus ([46]genitive Dios). [47]Nysa, for Greek
   writers, is either the [48]nymph who nursed him, or the mountain where
   he was attended by several nymphs (the [49]Nysiads), who fed him and
   made him immortal as directed by [50]Hermes.^[51][6]

   The [52]retinue of Dionysus was called the [53]Thiasus and comprised
   chiefly [54]Maenads.

[[80]edit] Worship

   The [81]Ludovisi Dionysus with panther, satyr and grapes on a vine
   ([82]Palazzo Altemps, [83]Rome)

          Main article: [84]Cult of Dionysus

   Dionysus is a god of [85]mystery religious rites, such as those
   practiced in honor of [86]Demeter and [87]Persephone at [88]Eleusis
   near [89]Athens. In the [90]Thracian mysteries, he wears the "bassaris"
   or [91]fox-skin, symbolizing new life. His own rites the [92]Dionysian
   Mysteries were the most secretive of all (See also [93]Maenads). Many
   scholars believe that Dionysus is a [94]syncretism of a local Greek
   nature deity and a more powerful god from [95]Thrace or [96]Phrygia
   such as [97]Sabazios.

   Though the name of Dionysus appears, surprisingly, in two tablets at
   Mycenaean [98]Pylos at the moment of its ruin,^[99][7] and one at
   [100]Khania (where he is worshipped alongside Zeus), [101]Herodotus,
   like all classical Greeks and many subsequent scholars until recently,
   was convinced that the worship of Dionysus arrived later among the
   Greeks than the Olympian pantheon. He remarks:

   as it is, the Greek story has it that no sooner was Dionysus born than
   Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to [102]Nysa in
   [103]Ethiopia beyond [104]Egypt; and as for [105]Pan, the Greeks do not
   know what became of him after his birth. It is therefore plain to me
   that the Greeks learned the names of these two gods later than the
   names of all the others, and trace the birth of both to the time when
   they gained the knowledge.

   Herodotus, Histories 2:146

   Many Greeks were sure that the cult of Dionysus arrived in Greece from
   [106]Anatolia, but Greek concepts of where Nysa was, whether set in
   Anatolia, or in [107]Libya ('away in the west beside a great ocean'),
   Ethiopia (Herodotus), or [108]Arabia (Diodorus Siculus), are variable
   enough to suggest that a magical distant land was intended, perhaps
   named 'Nysa' to explain the god's unreadable name, as the 'god of
   Nysa.' [109]Apollodorus seems to be following Pherecydes, who relates
   how the infant Dionysus, god of the grapevine, was nursed by the
   rain-nymphs, the [110]Hyades at Nysa. The Anatolian [111]Hittites' name
   for themselves in their own language ("Nesili") was "Nesi," however.
   The Hittites' influence on early Greek culture is often unappreciated.

   The above contradictions suggest to some that we are dealing not with
   the historical memory of a cult that is foreign, but with a god in whom
   foreignness is inherent. And indeed, Dionysus's name, as mentioned
   above, is found on [112]Mycenean [113]Linear B tablets as
   "DI-WO-NU-SO-JO",^[114][8] and [115]Karl Kerenyi^[116][9] traces him to
   [117]Minoan Crete, where his Minoan name is unknown but his
   characteristic presence is recognizable. Clearly, Dionysus had been
   with the Greeks and their predecessors a long time, and yet always
   retained the feel of something alien.

   The [118]bull, the [119]serpent, the [120]ivy and the wine are the
   signs of the characteristic Dionysian atmosphere, and Dionysus is
   strongly associated with [121]satyrs, [122]centaurs, and [123]sileni.
   He is often shown riding a [124]leopard, wearing a leopard skin, or in
   a chariot drawn by [125]panthers, and may also be recognized by the
   [126]thyrsus he carries. Besides the [127]grapevine and its wild barren
   alter-ego, the toxic ivy plant, both sacred to him, the [128]fig was
   also his symbol. The [129]pinecone that tipped his thyrsus linked him
   to [130]Cybele, and the [131]pomegranate linked him to [132]Demeter.
   The [133]Dionysia and [134]Lenaia festivals in [135]Athens were
   dedicated to Dionysus. Initiates worshipped him in the [136]Dionysian
   Mysteries, which were comparable to and linked with the [137]Orphic
   Mysteries, and may have influenced [138]Gnosticism^[[139]citation
   needed]. Orpheus was said to have invented the Mysteries of
   Dionysus.^[140][10]

[[141]edit] Bacchanalia

   [142]Bacchus by [143]Caravaggio

          Main article: [144]Bacchanalia

   Introduced into [145]Rome (c. 200 BC) from the [146]Greek culture of
   southern Italy or by way of Greek-influenced [147]Etruria, the
   bacchanalia were held in secret and attended by women only, in the
   grove of Simila, near the [148]Aventine Hill, on [149]March 16 and 17.
   Subsequently, admission to the rites were extended to men and
   celebrations took place five times a month. The notoriety of these
   festivals, where many kinds of crimes and political conspiracies were
   supposed to be planned, led in 186 BC to a decree of the [150]Senate
   the so-called Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus, inscribed on a bronze
   tablet discovered in [151]Calabria (1640), now at [152]Vienna by which
   the Bacchanalia were prohibited throughout all Italy except in certain
   special cases which must be approved specifically by the Senate. In
   spite of the severe punishment inflicted on those found in violation of
   this decree, the Bacchanalia were not stamped out, at any rate in the
   south of Italy, for a very long time.

   Dionysus is equated with both Bacchus and [153]Liber (also Liber
   Pater). Liber ("the free one") was a god of fertility, wine, and
   growth, married to [154]Libera. His festival was the [155]Liberalia,
   celebrated on [156]March 17, but in some myths the festival was also
   held on [157]March 5.

   province, [162]China.

   Dionysus sometimes has the [163]epithet Acratophorus, by which he was
   designated as the giver of unmixed wine, and worshipped at
   [164]Phigaleia in [165]Arcadia.^[166][11]^[167][12] In [168]Sicyon he
   was worshiped by the name Acroreites.^[169][13] As Bacchus, he carried
   the Latin epithet Adoneus, "Ruler".^[170][14] Aegobolus, "goat killer",
   was the name under which he was worshiped at [171]Potniae in
   [172]Boeotia.^[173][15] As [174]Aesymnetes ("ruler" or "lord") he was
   worshipped at Aro and [175]Patrae in [176]Achaea. Another epithet was
   Bromios, "the thunderer" or "he of the loud shout". As Dendrites, "he
   of the trees", he is a powerful fertility god. [177]Dithyrambos is
   sometimes used to refer to him or to solemn songs sung to him at
   festivals; the name refers to his premature birth. Eleutherios ("the
   liberator") was an epithet for both Dionysus and [178]Eros. Other forms
   of the god as that of fertility include the epithet in [179]Samos and
   [180]Lesbos [181]Enorches ("with balls"^[182][16] or perhaps "in the
   testicles" in reference to Zeus' sewing the babe Dionysus into his
   thigh, i.e., his testicles).^[183][17] Evius is an epithet of his used
   prominently in [184]Euripides' play, [185]The Bacchae. [186]Iacchus,
   possibly an epithet of Dionysus, is associated with the [187]Eleusinian
   Mysteries; in [188]Eleusis, he is known as a son of [189]Zeus and
   [190]Demeter. The name "Iacchus" may come from the (Iakchos), a hymn
   sung in honor of Dionysus. With the epithet Liknites ("he of the
   winnowing fan") he is a fertility god connected with the [191]mystery
   religions. A winnowing fan was similar to a [192]shovel and was used to
   separate the chaff from the grain. In addition, Dionysus is known as
   Lyaeus ("he who unties") as a god of relaxation and freedom from worry,
   and as Oeneus he is the god of the [193]wine press.

   In the Greek [194]pantheon, Dionysus (along with [195]Zeus) absorbs the
   role of [196]Sabazios, a [197]Thracian/[198]Phrygian deity. In the
   [199]Roman pantheon, Sabazius became an alternate name for
   Bacchus.^[200][18]

[[201]edit] Mythology

[[202]edit] Birth

   Dionysian procession on a marble [203]sarcophagus, born in 1982
   possibly indicating that the deceased was an initiate into the
   [204]mysteries

   Dionysus had a strange birth^[[205]citation needed] that evokes the
   difficulty in fitting him into the [206]Olympian pantheon. His mother
   was a mortal woman. [207]Semele, the daughter of king [208]Cadmus of
   [209]Thebes, and his father [210]Zeus, the king of the gods. Zeus'
   wife, [211]Hera, a jealous and prudish goddess, discovered the affair
   while Semele was pregnant. Appearing as an old [212]crone (in other
   stories a nurse), Hera befriended Semele, who confided in her that Zeus
   was the actual father of the baby in her womb. Hera pretended not to
   believe her, and planted seeds of doubt in Semele's mind. Curious,
   Semele demanded of Zeus that he reveal himself in all his glory as
   proof of his godhood. Though Zeus begged her not to ask this, she
   persisted and he agreed. Therefore he came to her wreathed in bolts of
   lightning; mortals, however, could not look upon an undisguised god
   without dying, and she perished in the ensuing blaze. Zeus rescued the
   foetal Dionysus by sewing him into his thigh. A few months later,
   Dionysus was born on Mount Pramnos in the island of [213]Ikaria, where
   Zeus went to release the now-fully-grown baby from his thigh. In this
   version, Dionysus is borne by two "mothers" (Semele and Zeus) before
   his birth, hence the epithet dimtr (of two mothers) associated with his
   being "twice-born".

   In the Cretan version of the same story, which [214]Diodorus Siculus
   follows,^[215][19] Dionysus was the son of Zeus and [216]Persephone,
   the queen of the [217]Greek underworld. Diodorus' sources equivocally
   identified the mother as Demeter.^[218][20] A jealous Hera again
   attempted to kill the child, this time by sending [219]Titans to rip
   Dionysus to pieces after luring the baby with toys. Zeus drove the
   Titans away with his thunderbolts, but only after the Titans ate
   everything but the heart, which was saved, variously, by [220]Athena,
   [221]Rhea, or [222]Demeter. Zeus used the heart to recreate him in the
   womb of Semele, hence he was again "the twice-born". Other versions
   claim that Zeus gave Semele the heart to eat to impregnate her.

   The rebirth in both versions of the story is the primary reason why
   Dionysus was worshipped in [223]mystery religions, as his death and
   rebirth were events of mystical reverence. This narrative was
   apparently used in several Greek and Roman cults, and variants of it
   are found in [224]Callimachus and [225]Nonnus, who refer to this
   Dionysus with the title [226]Zagreus, and also in several fragmentary
   poems attributed to [227]Orpheus.^[[228]citation needed]

[[229]edit] Early life

   ]]
   [230]Hermes and the Infant Dionysus by [231]Praxiteles, [232]Olympia
   Archaeological Museum
   [233]Kylix (6th century BC) depicting Dionysus among the sailors
   transformed to dolphins after attempting to kidnap him

   The legend goes that Zeus gave the infant Dionysus into the charge of
   Hermes. One version of the story is that Hermes took the boy to King
   [234]Athamas and his wife [235]Ino, Dionysus' aunt. Hermes bade the
   couple raise the boy as a girl, to hide him from Hera's
   wrath.^[236][21] Another version is that Dionysus was taken to the
   rain-[237]nymphs of [238]Nysa, who nourished his infancy and childhood,
   and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the
   [239]Hyades among the stars (see [240]Hyades star cluster). Other
   versions have Zeus giving him to Rhea, or to Persephone to raise in the
   Underworld, away from Hera. Alternatively, he was raised by [241]Maro.

   When Dionysus grew up he discovered the culture of the vine and the
   mode of extracting its precious juice; but Hera struck him with
   madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts of the
   earth. In [242]Phrygia the goddess [243]Cybele, better known to the
   Greeks as Rhea, cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he
   set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation
   of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition
   to [244]India, which is said to have lasted several years. Returning in
   triumph he undertook to introduce his worship into Greece, but was
   opposed by some princes who dreaded its introduction on account of the
   disorders and madness it brought with it. (See [245]Pentheus or
   [246]Lycurgus.)

   As a young man, Dionysus was exceptionally attractive. Once, while
   disguised as a mortal sitting beside the seashore, a few sailors
   spotted him, believing he was a prince. They attempted to kidnap him
   and sail him far away to sell for ransom or into slavery. They tried to
   bind him with ropes, but no type of rope could hold him. Dionysus
   turned into a fierce lion and unleashed a bear onboard, killing those
   he came into contact with. Those who jumped off the ship were
   mercifully turned into dolphins. The only survivor was the helmsman,
   [247]Acoetes, who recognized the god and tried to stop his sailors from
   the start.^[248][22] In a similar story, Dionysus desired to sail from
   [249]Icaria to [250]Naxos. He then hired a [251]Tyrrhenian pirate ship.
   But when the god was on board, they sailed not to Naxos but to Asia,
   intending to sell him as a slave. So Dionysus turned the mast and oars
   into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes so
   that the sailors went mad and, leaping into the sea, were turned into
   dolphins.

[[252]edit] Other stories

[[253]edit] Midas

   Once, Dionysus found his old school master and foster father,
   [254]Silenus, missing. The old man had been drinking, and had wandered
   away drunk, and was found by some peasants, who carried him to their
   king, [255]Midas (alternatively, he passed out in Midas' rose garden).
   Midas recognized him, and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for
   ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus entertained Midas
   and his friends with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, he brought
   Silenus back to Dionysus. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever
   reward he wanted. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be
   changed into gold. Dionysus consented, though was sorry that he had not
   made a better choice. Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he
   hastened to put to the test. He touched and turned to gold an oak twig
   and a stone. Overjoyed, as soon as he got home, he ordered the servants
   to set a feast on the table. Then he found that his bread, meat,
   daughter and wine turned to gold.

   Upset, Midas strove to divest himself of his power (the [256]Midas
   Touch); he hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus,
   begging to be delivered from starvation. Dionysus heard and consented;
   he told Midas to wash in the river [257]Pactolus. He did so, and when
   he touched the waters the power passed into them, and the river sands
   changed into gold. This was an etiological myth that explained why the
   sands of the Pactolus were rich in gold.

[[259]edit] Pentheus

   [260]Euripides wrote a tale concerning the destructive nature of
   Dionysus in [261]The Bacchae. Since Euripides wrote this play while in
   the court of King [262]Archelaus of [263]Macedon, some scholars believe
   that the cult of Dionysus was malicious in Macedon but benign in
   [264]Athens. In the play, Dionysus returns to his birthplace,
   [265]Thebes, ruled by his cousin, [266]Pentheus. He wanted to exact
   revenge on the women of Thebes, his aunts [267]Agave, Ino and
   [268]Autonoe and his cousin Pentheus, for not believing his mother
   Semele when she said she had been impregnated by Zeus, and for denying
   that Dionysus was a god and therefore not worshipping him. Pentheus was
   slowly driven mad by the compelling Dionysus, and lured to the woods of
   [269]Mount Cithaeron to see the [270]Maenads, female worshippers of
   Dionysus who often experienced divine ecstasy. When the women spotted
   Pentheus, they tore him to pieces as they did a herd of cattle earlier
   in the play. Brutally, his head was torn off by his mother Agave as he
   begged for his life.

[[271]edit] Hestia

   When Hestia, goddess of the hearth and home decided to leave the
   Council of Twelve and tend to the fireplace of all family houses. Zeus
   chose Dionysus to take her place on Olympus as the immortal god of
   wine, revelry, and parties.

[[272]edit] Lycurgus

   When King [273]Lycurgus of [274]Thrace heard that Dionysus was in his
   kingdom, he imprisoned all the followers of Dionysus; the god fled,
   taking refuge with [275]Thetis, and sent a drought which stirred the
   people into revolt. Dionysus then made King Lycurgus insane, having him
   slice his own son into pieces with an axe, thinking he was a patch of
   ivy, a plant holy to Dionysus. An [276]oracle then claimed that the
   land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus was alive, so his
   people had him [277]drawn and quartered; with Lycurgus dead, Dionysus
   lifted the curse.

[[278]edit] Prosymnus

   A better-known story is that of his descent to Hades to rescue his
   mother Semele, whom he placed among the stars.^[279][23] He made the
   descent from a reputedly bottomless pool on the coast of the
   [280]Argolid near the prehistoric site of [281]Lerna. He was guided by
   [282]Prosymnus or Polymnus, who requested, as his reward, to be
   Dionysus' lover. Prosymnus died before Dionysus could honor his pledge,
   so in order to satisfy Prosymnus' shade, the Dionysus fashioned a
   [283]phallus from an olive branch and sat on it at Prosymnus'
   tomb.^[284][24] This story is told in full only in Christian sources
   (whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology and, therefore, may not be
   trustworthy). It appears to have served as an explanation of the secret
   objects that were revealed in the [285]Dionysian Mysteries.^[286][25]

[[287]edit] Ampelos

   Another myth according to [288]Nonnus involves [289]Ampelos, a
   [290]satyr. Foreseen by Dionysus, the youth was killed in an accident
   riding a bull maddened by the sting of an [291]Ate's gadfly. The
   [292]Fates granted Ampelos a second life as a vine, from which Dionysus
   squeezed the first wine.^[293][26]

[[294]edit] Secondary myths

   [295]Bacchus and Ariadne by [296]Titian

   When [297]Hephaestus bound [298]Hera to a magical chair, Dionysus got
   him drunk and brought him back to Olympus after he passed out.

   A third descent by Dionysus to Hades is invented by [299]Aristophanes
   in his comedy [300]The Frogs. Dionysus, as patron of the Athenian
   dramatic festival, the Dionysia, wants to bring back to life one of the
   great tragedians. After a competition [301]Aeschylus is chosen in
   preference to [302]Euripides.

   When [303]Theseus abandoned [304]Ariadne sleeping on Naxos, Dionysus
   found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but he
   committed suicide or was killed by [305]Perseus. In some variants, he
   had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in
   others, he descended into [306]Hades to restore her to the gods on
   Olympus.

   [307]Callirhoe was a [308]Calydonian woman who scorned a priest of
   Dionysus who threatened to inflict all the women of Calydon with
   insanity (see [309]Maenad). The priest was ordered to sacrifice
   Callirhoe but he killed himself instead. Callirhoe threw herself into a
   well which was later named after her.

   [310]Acis, a [311]Sicilian youth, was sometimes said to be Bacchus'
   son.

   "Bacchus" by [366]Michelangelo 1497
   Statue of [367]Dionysus (Sardanapalus), in the [368]Museo Palazzo
   Massimo Alle Terme in Rome, Italy

   Naturally, the god appeared on many [369]kraters and other wine vessels
   from [370]classical Greece. His iconography became more complex in the
   Hellenistic period, between severe archaising or [371]Neo Attic types
   such as the Dionysus Sardanapalus and types showing him as an indolent
   and androgynous young man (see the [372]Dionysus and Eros, [373]Naples
   Archeological Museum).

   E. Kessler has theorized that a mosaic appearing on the triclinium
   floor of the House of Aion in Nea Paphpos, [374]Cyprus details a
   monotheistic worship of Dionysus.^[375][27] In the mosaic, other gods
   appear but may only be lesser representations of the centrally-imposed
   Dionysus.

[[380]edit] Parallels with Christianity

   [381]Martin Hengel argued Dionysian religion and Christianity to be
   significantly parallel, stating that "Dionysus had been at home in
   Palestine for a long time", and Judaism was influenced by Dionysian
   traditions.^[382][28]

   The modern scholar [383]Barry Powell thinks that Christian notions of
   eating and drinking the "flesh" and "blood" of [384]Jesus were
   influenced by the cult of Dionysus. In another parallel Powell adduces,
   Dionysus was distinct among Greek gods as a deity commonly felt within
   individual followers. Another example of possible influence on
   Christianity, Dionysus' followers, as well as another god, [385]Pan,
   are said to have had the most influence on the noncanonical depiction
   of [386]Satan as [387]animal-like and [388]horned.^[389][29]

   Wine was important to Dionysus, imagined as its creator; the creation
   of wine from water figures also in Jesus's [390]Marriage at Cana. In
   the 19th century, Bultmann and others compared both themes and
   concluded that the Dionysian theophany was transferred to Jesus. At
   [391]Elis during the Thyeia, the festival of Dionysus, three pots would
   be placed by priests in a sealed room and the following day be found to
   miraculously be filled with wine.^[392][30]^[393][31] At [394]Andros
   and [395]Teos water flowing from the spring in the temple of Dionysus
   changed to wine on his feast days, January 5 and 6; the Marriage at
   Cana is placed on [396]6 January in the Christian
   calendar.^[397][32]^[398][33] Heinz Noetzel's Christus und Dionysos
   disagrees,^[399][34] arguing Dionysus never actually did turn water
   into wine. Martin Hengel replied that opposing traditions would be
   anachronistic, and that since all Palestinians were familiar with the
   transformation of water to wine as a miracle, it was expected from the
   Messiah to perform it.

   Peter Wick argues that the use of wine symbolism in the [400]Gospel of
   John, including the story of the [401]Marriage at Cana at which Jesus
   turns water into wine, is intended to show Jesus as superior to
   Dionysus.^[402][35]

[[404]edit] Modern views

   Dionysus has remained an inspiration to artists, philosophers and
   writers into the [405]modern era. In his 1872 book [406]The Birth of
   Tragedy, the German philosopher [407]Friedrich Nietzsche contrasted
   [408]Dionysus with the god Apollo as a symbol of the fundamental,
   unrestrained [409]aesthetic principle of force, music, and intoxication
   versus the principle of sight, form, and beauty represented by the
   latter. Nietzsche continued to contemplate the character of Dionysus,
   which he revisited in the final pages of his 1886 work [410]Beyond Good
   and Evil. This reconceived [411]Nietzschean Dionysus was invoked as an
   embodyment of the central [412]will to power concept in Nietzsche's
   later works [413]The Twilight of the Idols, [414]The Antichrist and
   [415]Ecce Homo.

   The [416]Russian [417]poet and [418]philosopher [419]Vyacheslav Ivanov
   elaborated the theory of [420]Dionysianism, which traces the roots of
   literary art in general and the art of tragedy in particular to ancient
   Dionysian mysteries. His views were expressed in the treatises The
   Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God (1904), and Dionysus and Early
   Dionysianism (1921).

   Inspired by [421]James Frazer, some have labeled Dionysus a
   [422]life-death-rebirth deity. The mythographer [423]Karl Kerenyi
   devoted much energy to Dionysus over his long career; he summed up his
   thoughts in Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life
   (Bollingen, Princeton) 1976.

   Dionysus is the main character of Aristophanes' play [424]The Frogs,
   later updated to a modern version by Burt Shevelove (libretto) and
   [425]Stephen Sondheim (music and lyrics) ("The time is the present. The
   place is ancient Greece. ... "). In the play, Dionysus and his slave
   Xanthius venture to Hades to bring a famed writer back from the dead,
   with the hopes that the writer's presence in the world will fix all
   nature of earthly problems. In Aristophanes' play, [426]Euripides
   competes against Aeschylus to be recovered from the underworld; In
   Sondheim and Shevelove's, [427]George Bernard Shaw faces [428]William
   Shakespeare.

   The Romanised equivalent of Dionysus was referenced in the [429]1852
   [430]plantation literature novel [431]Aunt Phillis's Cabin, which
   featured a character named Uncle Bacchus, who was so-named due to his
   excessive [432]alcoholism.

   Both [433]Eddie Campbell and [434]Grant Morrison have utilised the
   character. Morrison claims that the myth of Dionysus provides the
   inspiration for his violent and explicit graphic novel [435]Kill Your
   Boyfriend, whilst Campbell used the character in his [436]Deadface
   series to explore both the conventions of [437]super-hero [438]comic
   books and artistic endeavour.

   [439]Walt Disney has depicted the character on a number of occasions.
   The first such portrayal of Dionysus, as the Roman Bacchus, was in the
   "[440]Pastoral" segment of Walt Disney's 3rd classic [441]Fantasia. In
   keeping with the more fun-loving Roman god, he is portrayed as an
   overweight, happily drunk man wearing a [442]tunic and cloak,
   [443]grape leaves on his head, carrying a [444]goblet of wine, and
   riding a drunken donkey named Jacchus ("[445]jackass"). He is friends
   with the [446]fauns and [447]centaurs, and is shown celebrating a
   harvest festival. Other portrayals have appeared in both the Disney
   [448]movie and [449]spin-off TV series of Hercules. He was depicted as
   an overweight drunkard as opposed to his youthful descriptions in
   myths. He has bright pink skin and rosy red cheeks hinting at his
   drunkenness. He always carries either a bottle or glass of wine in his
   hand, and like in the myths, wears a wreath of grape leaves upon his
   head. He is known by his Roman name in the series 'Bacchus', and in one
   episode headlines his own festival known as the 'Bacchanal'.

   In music Dionysius (together with [450]Demeter) was used as an
   archetype for the character Tori by contemporary artist [451]Tori Amos
   in her 2007 album [452]American Doll Posse, and the Canadian rock band
   [453]Rush refer to a confrontation and hatred between Dionysus and
   [454]Apollo in the [455]Cygnus X-1 duology.

                Statue of Dionysus in the [456]British Museum

   In literature, Dionysius has proven equally inspiring. [457]Rick
   Riordan's series of books [458]Percy Jackson & The Olympians presents
   Dionysus as an uncaring, childish and spoilt god who as a punishment
   has to work in Camp Half-Blood. In [459]Fred Saberhagen's 2001 novel,
   God of the Golden Fleece, a young man in a post-apocalyptic world picks
   up an ancient piece of technology shaped in the likeness of the
   Dionysus. Here, Dionysus is depicted as a relatively weak god, albeit a
   subversive one whose powers are able to undermine the authority of
   tyrants. A version of Bacchus also appears in C.S. Lewis' [460]Prince
   Caspian, part of the [461]Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis depicts him as
   dangerous-looking, androgynous young boy who helps Aslan awaken the
   spirits of the Narnian trees and rivers. He does not appear in the 2008
   film version.

    3. [475]^ Fox, p.221, "The divine mission of Dionysus was to mingle
       the music of the flute and to bring surcease to care"; Fox then
       cites Euripides as a direct source for this statement. Euripides,
       Bacchae, Choral II, lines 379-381: "[370] Holiness, queen of the
       gods, Holiness, who bear your golden wings along the earth, do you
       hear these words from Pentheus? Do you hear his unholy [375]
       insolence against Bromius, the child of Semele, the first deity of
       the gods at the banquets where guests wear beautiful garlands? He
       holds this office, to join in dances, [380] to laugh with the
       flute, and to bring an end to cares, whenever the delight of the
       grape comes at the feasts of the gods, and in ivy-bearing banquets
       [385] the goblet sheds sleep over men." [476][1]

       Mount Nysa which figures in the story of Lykourgos: (...) when
       Dionysos had been reborn from the thigh of Zeus, Hermes entrusted
       him to the nymphs of Mount Nysa, who fed him on the food of the
       gods, and made him immortal".

       so that we have no means of verifying his divinity."
