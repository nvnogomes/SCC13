   [8]Designer [9]Greg Gorden
   [10]Publisher [11]FASA (1st edition)
   Living Room Games (2nd edition)
   RedBrick Limited (Classic edition)

   System [13]Step System

   Earthdawn is a [16]fantasy [17]role-playing game, originally produced
   by [18]FASA in 1993.^[19][1] In 1999 it was licensed to Living Room
   Games, which produced the Second Edition line. It is currently licensed
   to RedBrick Limited, a company that is producing the Classic or
   RedBrick's Earthdawn line (which is essentially an alternative second
   edition; see History below for more information).

   The game is similar to fantasy games like [20]Dungeons & Dragons, but
   draws more inspiration from games like [21]RuneQuest. The rules of the
   game are tightly bound to the underlying [22]magical [23]metaphysics,
   with the goal of creating a richer, more realistic fantasy world. Like
   many role-playing games from the nineties, Earthdawn focuses much of
   its detail on its [24]setting, a province called Barsaive.

[[34]edit] History

   Starting in 1993, FASA released over 20 gaming supplements describing
   this universe; however, it closed down production of Earthdawn in
   January 1999. During that time several [35]novels and short story
   anthologies set in the Earthdawn universe were also released. In late
   1999, FASA granted Living Room Games a licensing agreement to produce
   new material for the game.

   The 2nd Edition did not alter the setting, though it did update the
   timeline to include events that took place in Barsaive. There were a
   few changes to the rules in the 2nd Edition; some classes were slightly
   different or altered abilities from the original. The changes were
   meant to allow for more rounded-out characters and better balance of
   play. Living Room Games last published in 2005, and they no longer have
   a license with FASA to publish Earthdawn material.^[36][2]

   In 2003, a second license was granted to RedBrick Limited, who are
   currently developing their own line based on the FASA products, while
   releasing the original FASA books in PDF form. The Earthdawn Player's
   Compendium and Earthdawn Gamemaster's Compendium are essentially an
   alternative second edition, but without a version designation (since
   the material is compatible anyway). Each book has over 500 pages, and
   summarizes much of what FASA published not only the game mechanics, but
   also the setting, narrations, and stories. For example, each Discipline
   has its own chapter, describing it from the point of view of different
   adepts. Likewise, Barsaive gets a complete treatment, and the chapters
   contain a lot of log entries and stories in addition to the setting
   descriptions; the same applies also to Horrors and Dragons.
   Earthdawn Player's Compendium (RedBrick Limited)

   While RedBrick Limited tried to remain faithful to FASA's vision and
   also tried to keep the visual style, they revised almost everything,
   and introduced some new material to fill the gaps. RedBrick Limited
   also began publishing Earthdawn novels in 2007. On July 8th 2008,
   RedBrick announced a new line called Age of Legend 4e, a port of the
   Earthdawn setting for use with the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition
   rules.

   In 1999 [37]Pyramid magazine named Earthdawn as one of The Millennium's
   Most Underrated Games. Editor Scott Haring noted (referring to the FASA
   edition) that "Earthdawn had an original, inventive magic system (no
   mean trick given the hundreds of fantasy RPGs that came before), and a
   game world that gave you the classic "monsters and dungeons" sort of
   RPG experience, but made sense doing it."^[38][3]

[[39]edit] Setting

   In Barsaive, magic, like many things in nature, goes through cycles. As
   the magic level rises, it allows alien creatures called [40]Horrors to
   cross from their distant, otherworldly [41]dimension into our own. The
   Horrors come in an almost infinite variety -- from simple eating
   machines that devour all they encounter, to incredibly intelligent and
   cunning foes that feed off the negative emotions they inspire in their
   prey.

   In the distant past of Earthdawn's setting, an [42]elf scholar
   discovered that the time of the Horrors was approaching, and founded
   the Eternal Library in order to discover a way to defeat them or at the
   very least, survive them. The community that grew up around the library
   developed wards and protections against the Horrors, which they traded
   to other lands and eventually became the powerful [43]Theran Empire, an
   extremely magically advanced civilization and the main antagonist of
   the Earthdawn setting.

   The peoples of the world built kaers, underground towns and cities,
   which they sealed with the Theran wards to wait out the time of the
   Horrors, which was called the Scourge. Theran wizards and politicians
   warned many of the outlying nations around Thera of the coming of the
   Horrors, offering the protection of the kaers to those who would pledge
   their loyalty to the Empire. Most of these nations agreed at first
   though some became unwilling to fulfill their end of the bargain after
   the end of the Scourge, wanting to have nothing to do with the
   bureaucratic nation run on political conflict and powered by slavery.
   After four hundred years of hiding, the Scourge ended, and the people
   emerged to a world changed by the Horrors. The player characters
   explore this new world, discovering lost secrets of the past, and
   fighting Horrors that remain.

   The primary setting of Earthdawn is Barsaive, a former province of the
   Theran Empire. Barsaive is a region of city-states, independent from
   the Therans since the [44]dwarven Kingdom of Throal led a rebellion
   against their former overlords.

   The Theran presence in Barsaive has been limited to a small part of
   south-western Barsaive, based around the magical fortress of Sky Point
   and the city of Vivane.

   The setting of Earthdawn is the same world as [45]Shadowrun, but takes
   place Millennia earlier.

[[46]edit] Races

   The setting of Earthdawn features several fantasy races for characters
   and NPCs:
    1. [47]Dwarf - Dwarfs in Earthdawn are similar in appearance to the
       classic [48]D&D or [49]Tolkien dwarves. They are the predominant
       race in Barsaive, and the dwarf language is considered the common
       language. Their culture, especially of the dominant Throal Kingdom,
       can be considered more of a [50]Renaissance-level culture than in
       most other fantasy settings, and form the main source of resistance
       to a return of [51]Thera's rule in Barsaive.
    2. [52]Elf - Elves in Earthdawn fit the common fantasy role-playing
       convention; they are tall, lithe, pointy-eared humanoids who prefer
       living in nature. Elves in Earthdawn naturally live a very long
       time; some are thought to be immortal. Such immortal Elves feature
       in many cross-pollinated storylines with [53]Shadowrun. A
       subspecies of Earthdawn elves are called the Blood Elves. The blood
       elves rejected the Theran protective magic, and attempted their own
       warding spells. These wards failed, and a last-ditch ritual caused
       thorns to thrust through the skin of the blood elves. These
       ever-bleeding wounds caused constant pain, but the self-inflicted
       suffering was enough to protect the blood elves from the worst of
       the horrors.
    3. [54]Human - Humans in Earthdawn are physically similar to humans in
       our own real world. Human adepts are granted a special Versatility
       talent to make them more mechanically appealing. Humans in
       Earthdawn are considered to be somewhat warlike in general outlook.
    4. Obsidiman - Obsidimen are a race of large, rock-based humanoids.
       They stand over 7 feet tall and weigh over 900 pounds. Their
       primary connection is to their Liferock, which is a large formation
       of stone within four hours of their place of birth. Obsidimen are
       loyal to the community around their Liferock, and eventually return
       to it. Obsidimen can live around 500 years away from their
       Liferock, and their ultimate lifespan is unknown, as they generally
       return to it and remain there. Due to their rocky nature and long
       lives, obsidimen are rather slow moving and deliberate in both
       speech and action, and can have difficulty understanding the
       smaller races' need for haste. However, if aroused by a threat to
       self, friend, or community, obsidimen are fearsome to behold.
    5. [55]Ork - The ork race in Earthdawn is similar to other depictions
       of orks in fantasy role-playing. They are tribal, nomadic and often
       barbaric humanoids, with green, tan, beige or ebony skin. They are
       relatively short-lived, and as a result many attempt to leave a
       legacy marked by a memorable death - preferably one that leaves no
       corpse. Before the Scourge almost all orks were enslaved by other
       races.
    6. [56]Troll - The troll race in Earthdawn is also similar to other
       fantasy role-playing depictions of trolls. They are very tall
       humanoids, with a hardened skin and horns. Socially, they form
       clans to which they are fiercely loyal. Troll clans often raid one
       another, and a significant subset of the troll race are crystal
       raiders, which command many of the airships of Barsaive. Other
       trolls, known as lowland trolls, have merged with mixed communities
       around Barsaive, although most retain the fierce cultural and
       personal pride of their less-civilized cousins.
    7. T'skrang - The t'skrang are lizard-like amphibian humanoids with
       long tails and a flair for dramatics. Many of them exhibit the
       behaviors and characteristics which are stereotypical to a
       "swashbuckler". T'skrang are often sailors, and many t'skrang
       families run ships up and down the rivers of Barsaive. A rare
       subrace of t'skrang, the k'stulaami, possess a flap of skin much
       like a [57]flying squirrel, allowing them to glide. While
       k'stulaami can be born as a random mutation in any t'skrang line,
       they tend to congregate into communities filled with their own
       kind.
    8. Windling - The windlings are small, winged humanoids; similar to
       many depictions of [58]fae creatures, they resemble small elves
       with insect-like wings. They have the ability to see into the
       astral plane, and are considerably luckier than the other races.
       Windlings are often somewhat mischievous, hedonistic, and eager for
       new experiences, and are culturally similar to the [59]Kender of
       [60]Krynn, but without the same [61]kleptomaniacal tendencies. They
       have wings similar to those of a dragonfly and are one to two feet
       in height.

[[64]edit] Magic in Earthdawn

   Earthdawn's magic system is highly varied but the essential idea is
   that every player character (called [65]Adepts) has some access to
   magic, used to perform abilities attained through their Disciplines.

   One of the most innovative ideas in Earthdawn is how magical items
   work. At first, most magical items work exactly like a mundane item of
   the same type. As a character searches for information about the item's
   history, performs certain tasks relating to that history, and spends
   legend points (the Earthdawn equivalent of [66]experience points) to
   activate the item, he unlocks some of the magic in the item. As the
   character learns more about the item and its history, he can unlock
   more and more power within the item.

   Each magical item, therefore, is unique by virtue of its history and
   the scope of its powers. For example, one magical broadsword may have
   only 4 magical ranks and only increases the damage of the blade. On the
   other hand the legendary sword Purifier, has 10 magical ranks and
   grants its wielder numerous powers.

[[67]edit] Game mechanics

   The Earthdawn Companion 2nd Edition cover shows Throal, the capital of
   Barsaive

   Earthdawn stands out from other tabletop RPGs with a unique approach to
   skill tests. Players wanting to perform an action determines their
   level or "step" for the skill, talent, or ability to be used. This step
   can then be looked up in a list of dice to be thrown.

   CAPTION: Examples of steps

   Step              Dice to be thrown
   3    1D4
   4    1D6
   5    1D8
   6    1D10
   7    1D12
   8    2D6
   9    1D8 + 1D6
   10   1D10+1D6
   11   1D10+1D8
   12   2D10
   13   1D12+1D10
   14   1D20+1D4 or 2D12 (Earthdawn Classic option)

   The result of each die is added (dice which reach their maximum value
   are thrown again, adding each maximum to the tally, along with the
   final result below maximum) and compared to a value decided by the game
   master/storyteller according to the difficulty of the task. This
   approach allows for impressively high scores with high level
   characters, yet leaves room for possible failure. This will sometimes
   make combat last longer than in other games.
