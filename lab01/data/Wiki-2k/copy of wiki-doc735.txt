East Bronx

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]East Bronx, New York)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   The neighborhood of [9]Co-op City is the largest cooperative housing
   development in the world.

   The East Bronx is that part of the [10]New York City borough of [11]the
   Bronx which lies east of the [12]Bronx River; this roughly corresponds
   to the eastern half of the borough. Neighborhoods include: Harding
   Park, Soundview, Castle Hill, Parkchester, Westchester Square, Van
   Nest, Pelham Parkway, Morris Park, Throgs Neck, Country Club, City
   Island, Pelham Bay, [13]Williamsbridge, Eastchester, Baychester,
   Edenwald, Wakefield, and Co-op City.

   The East Bronx is located farther from [14]Manhattan than its western
   counterpart, and consequently it is less dense. While the [15]West
   Bronx is older and very hilly, the East Bronx looks distinct in that it
   is not only somewhat newer and later-settled but also very flat and
   coastal, much like the nearby borough of [16]Queens. The East Bronx is
   also distinct from the West Bronx in that the two were annexed by the
   City of New York at two separate times; the West Bronx seceded from
   Westchester County in 1874, while the East Bronx was part of
   Westchester until 1895.^[17][1]

   Unlike the West Bronx, the East Bronx has few numbered streets; these
   streets are largely designated to a handful of neighborhoods. Note that
   because the Bronx uses the same street numbering system as Manhattan,
   streets designated as "east" (e.g. East 161st Street) may actually be
   located west of the Bronx River. This is because the east-west divider
   is [18]Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and Jerome Avenue in the Bronx (which
   is directly north of Fifth Avenue), and there is only a relatively
   small area in the Bronx west of Jerome Avenue. Thus while all numbered
   streets in the East Bronx are necessarily designated "east", an "east"
   street designation does not automatically mean that the area in
   question is part of the East Bronx.

   The East Bronx has historically had a large [19]Italian American
   population, and they still make up the biggest group in the
   neighborhoods of Morris Park, Pelham Bay, Pelham Gardens, Throgs Neck,
   Country Club, and City Island. The North East Bronx has a large Black
   Caribbean population, in particular in the neighborhoods of Wakefield,
   Baychester and Edenwald. Parkchester is home to a large [20]Asian
   American population - in particular [21]Bengalis, [22]Pakistanis, and
   [23]Chinese. Throughout the East Bronx, [24]Hispanic Americans - of
   Puerto Rican and Dominican heritage - can be found and they comprise
   majority populations in Soundview, Castle Hill, Westchester Square and
   Van Nest. [25]Albanians are a presence throughout the East Bronx, in
   particular in Van Nest, Morris Park and Pelham Parkway.

   However, the rather meaningful differences between the East and West
   Bronx go largely neglected today. Prior to the 1970s, New Yorkers
   generally saw the Bronx as being split into its eastern and western
   halves, as is historically and culturally accurate; however, with the
   urban decay that hit the southwestern Bronx starting in the 1960s,
   people began to see the borough as being fundamentally divided between
   the southwestern area ("The [26]South Bronx") and everywhere else. The
   notion of the "South Bronx" is arguably outdated considering that urban
   decay and high poverty rates have extended further north into
   Fordham-Bedford, Bedford Park, and University Heights, and further east
   into Soundview, Castle Hill, and Parkchester.
