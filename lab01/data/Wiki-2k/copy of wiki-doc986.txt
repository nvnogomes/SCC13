[[31]edit] Early life and education

   Egbert Brown was born in [32]Brownsville, New York, and as a young man
   sailed on a whaler before settling in [33]Toledo, Ohio, in the early
   1840s. He was a respected grain dealer and built the first steam
   elevator in town. After successively working his way to Mayor of
   Toledo, he moved to [34]St. Louis, Missouri, in 1852 and engaged in the
   railroad business.

[[35]edit] Civil War

   In August 1861, Brown was commissioned as the [36]lieutenant colonel of
   the [37]7th Missouri Infantry. He resigned the commission in May 1862
   to become a [38]brigadier general of the [39]Missouri State Militia
   (Union). He then was appointed as a brigadier general of U.S.
   volunteers to rank from November 29, 1862.

   Brown's command duties primarily involved suppressing [40]Confederate
   [41]guerrillas and opposing raids from [42]Arkansas and the [43]Indian
   Territory. Among the high points of his career were two victories over
   [44]Joseph Shelby, at the [45]Second Battle of Springfield during
   Marmaduke's first raid, and at [46]Marshall, Missouri, during
   [47]Shelby's Great Raid of 1863. In the Springfield battle, Brown was
   severely wounded in the shoulder and lost the use of an arm. He
   received command of the District of Central Missouri during 1863 and
   through 1864.

   Although successful in many engagements, Brown was condemned by some
   for lack of vigor. This came to a head during [48]Sterling Price's 1864
   raid of Missouri. At the [49]Battle of Westport, Union [50]Maj. Gen.
   [51]Alfred Pleasonton relieved Brown of command and arrested him for
   failure to promptly obey an order to attack. Brown assumed command of
   the District of Rolla in January 1865 until the end of the war.

[[52]edit] Post-war

   Brown was the United States pension agent in St. Louis from 1866 to
   1868. He resigned to operate a farm in [53]Illinois. He died in the
   home of a granddaughter at [54]West Plains, Missouri, on February 11,
   1902, and was buried next to his wife in [55]Cuba, Missouri.
