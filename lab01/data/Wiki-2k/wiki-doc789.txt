   Eberbach Abbey, 2006

   Eberbach Abbey is a former [8]Cistercian monastery near [9]Eltville am
   Rhein in the [10]Rheingau, [11]Germany. On account of its impressive
   [12]Romanesque and [13]early Gothic buildings it is considered one of
   the most significant architectural heritage sites in [14]Hesse,
   [15]Germany. In the winter of 1985/86 the interior scenes of the film
   "[16]The Name of the Rose" were filmed here.

[[26]edit] History

   Abbey church
   Dormitory

   It was founded in [27]1136 by [28]Bernard of Clairvaux as the first
   Cistercian monastery on the east bank of the [29]Rhine, on the site of
   a previous monastic foundation of Adalbert I of [30]Saarbrcken,
   occupied at first by [31]Augustinian canons and then by [32]Benedictine
   monks, which had however failed to establish itself.

   It soon became one of the largest and most active monasteries of
   Germany from which a number of other foundations were made: [33]Schnau
   Abbey near [34]Heidelberg in 1142; [35]Otterberg Abbey in the
   [36]Palatinate in 1144; Gottesthal Abbey near [37]Liege in 1155; and
   Arnsburg Abbey in the [38]Wetterau in 1174. At its height in the 12th
   and 13th centuries, the population is estimated to have been about 100
   monks and over 200 [39]lay brothers.

   Ebersbach Abbey was also very successful economically, principally as a
   result of profits from the cultivation of vineyards and the production
   of wine. At least 14 members of the family of the Counts of
   [40]Katzenelnbogen were buried in the church. Among them was Count
   Johann IV of Katzenelnbogen, who was the first to plant
   [41]Riesling^[42][1] vines, in a new vineyard in the nearby village of
   [43]Rsselsheim, when the monks of Eberbach were still growing red
   grapes such as [44]Grobrot, the earliest grape variety recorded in
   Eberbach.

   In about [45]1525 it is said that in the abbey there was an enormous
   wine barrel with a volume of between ca. 50,000 and 100,000 litres,
   which in the [46]Peasants' War of 1525 was heavily used by rebels from
   the Rheingau, who were encamped just below the monastery.

   The abbey suffered severe damage during the [47]Thirty Years' War,
   beginning with the attack of the [48]Swedish army in 1631. Many
   valuable items from the church and the library were looted, and the
   monks were forced to flee, of whom only 20 returned in 1635 to begin a
   laborious reconstruction.

   The 18th century however was a period of great economic success:
   surviving accounts show that the abbey profits were regularly invested
   on the [49]Frankfurt money market.

   The final decline set in with the [50]French Revolution. After the
   [51]Reichsdeputationshauptschluss the abbey was dissolved on [52]18
   September [53]1803 and with its assets and territory became the
   property of Prince Friedrich August of [54]Nassau-Usingen.

[[55]edit] After secularisation

   The lands passed from Nassau-Usingen in 1866 to [56]Prussia, and from
   1945 have formed part of the State of Hesse. The premises were put to a
   variety of uses. A lunatic asylum was accommodated here until 1873 (the
   forerunner of the Zentrum fr Soziale Psychiatrie Rheinblick) and until
   1912 a prison.

   Management of the vineyards and wine production has continued in state
   hands. After considerable structural work Eberbach serves inter alia as
   a venue of international importance for cultural events and displays,
   and as a film location, as for example for [57]Umberto Eco's "[58]The
   Name of the Rose" (1985).

[[59]edit] The Eberbach Abbey Foundation

   Abbey church
   Cloisters

   With effect from [60]1 January [61]1998 the Land of Hesse transferred
   the entire abbey complex into the ownership of a publicly owned
   charitable foundation, the "Eberbach Abbey Foundation" ("Stiftung
   Kloster Eberbach"), which has the declared aim of conserving the
   architectural and cultural monument that is Eberbach Abbey by
   overseeing its appropriate, controlled and sustainable use as well as
   of maintaining the historical tradition of wine production.

[[62]edit] Buildings

   The buildings form one of the most impressive monastic sites in
   Germany, preserving structures of the highest quality from the
   Romanesque, [63]Gothic and [64]Baroque periods. A list of goods, the
   "Oculus Memoriae", survives from as early as the year 1211, giving
   information on the possessions and premises of the abbey complex.

   The existing buildings include:
     * The abbey church, a three-aisled Romanesque [65]basilica with
       transept, containing the tombs of some of the [66]Archbishops of
       Mainz;
     * The cloisters, the south side of which is Gothic, the north side
       partly Gothic and partly Romanesque and the remainder a 19th
       century restoration;
     * The Chapter Room, a late Gothic square room with a central pillar,
       restored with ceiling and wall paintings;
     * The Fraternei, an early Gothic room with heavy vaulting, used since
       the Middle Ages as a wine cellar. It is also known as the
       Cabinetkeller, which is the origin of the use of the term Kabinett
       as a quality description of German wine;
     * The dormitory, an early Gothic room about 70 metres long containing
       vaulting and short columns with sculptured capitals, and one of the
       few such rooms of this size and quality remaining in Europe;
     * The north wing, refurbished in the 18th century and containing the
       refectory, with a Baroque stucco ceiling by [67]Daniel Schenk. It
       replaced the earlier Gothic refectory to the north;
     * The west wing, accommodating the library, where the abbey museum
       was set up in 1995. This contains inter alia the oldest surviving
       Cistercian glass window in Germany (of about 1180), the original
       capitals from the cloisters, now replaced by modern replicas,
       various sculptures, paintings of Bernard of Clairvaux and Baroque
       furnishings;
     * In a separate building to the west of the monastic quarters, the
       "Converts' Building" or "Lay-Brothers' Building", containing the
       lay-brothers' refectory (45 metres long) and dormitory (at over 80
       metres long, the largest surviving Romanesque secular room in
       Europe), and attached to it a Romanesque wine-cellar and various
       small domestic buildings from the 17th century;
     * Beyond the monastic precincts to the east, the hospital, service
       buildings and 18th and 19th century wine cellars.

[[68]edit] Wine production

   Wine cellar of Eberbach Abbey

   The vineyards of Eberbach Abbey were, at 300 hectares, the largest in
   medieval Europe. Most of them are now the property of the state of
   Hesse and are run by the Hessische Staatsweingter GmbH Kloster
   Eberbach, which manages the largest connected area of wine production
   in Germany, comprising vineyards on the slopes of the Rhine Valley and
   on the Hessische Bergstrasse. Of the 200 hectares which are under
   cultivation, three-quarters are planted with [69]Riesling, but
   [70]Chardonnay, [71]Pinot blanc, [72]Pinot gris, [73]Pinot noir and
   [74]Dornfelder are also grown.

   Wine tasting and sales take place in the New Hospital.

[[75]edit] Burials

     * [76]Adolph II of Nassau

[[77]edit] Current information

   The abbey is the principal venue for the concerts of the Rheingau Music
   Festival and other similar productions. The public areas can be viewed
   daily, either with or without guided tours. Rooms can be booked for
   conferences and events. Wine tastings for groups can also be booked,
   and twice a year there are wine auctions.

   On the night of [78]26 April [79]2005 the abbey suffered severe damage
   from flooding. This was due to torrential rain, which caused the little
   river [80]Kisselbach to burst its banks, and the increased volume of
   water brought about the collapse of the 18th century storm drain under
   the abbey.
