   Dressed to Kill is a [29]1980 [30]suspense [31]thriller/[32]horror film
   written and directed by [33]Brian de Palma. It stars [34]Michael Caine,
   [35]Angie Dickinson and [36]Nancy Allen. The original music score is
   composed by [37]Pino Donaggio. The film is marketed with the tagline
   "Brian de Palma, master of the macabre, invites you to a showing of the
   latest fashion... in murder." It centers on the murder of a housewife,
   and the investigation headed by the witness to the murder, a young
   [38]prostitute, and the housewifes teenaged son.

   The film was the target of some backlash from the [39]gay and
   [40]transgender communities, who felt that its portrayal of transgender
   people was misguided and [41]homophobic. The film is rated R by the
   [42]MPAA and runs at 105 minutes.

[[48]edit] Plot summary

   Kate Miller ([49]Angie Dickinson) is a [50]sexually frustrated
   housewife and mother who is in therapy with [51]New York City
   psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott ([52]Michael Caine). During an
   appointment with Dr. Elliott, Kate attempts to seduce him, at which
   point Elliott rejects her advances. Later that day, Kate goes to the
   [53]Metropolitan Museum and for ten minutes without any dialog has an
   unexpected flirtation with a mysterious stranger. Kate and the stranger
   "stalk" each other through the museum until they finally wind up
   outside, where Kate joins him in a taxicab. They immediately begin to
   have sex right there in the cab, and their experience continues at his
   apartment.

   Later, Kate awakens and discreetly leaves while the man is asleep, but
   not before she rifles through some of his papers and discovers that he
   has a [54]sexually transmitted disease. Mortified, Kate leaves the
   apartment and gets in the elevator, but on the way down she realizes
   that she's left her [55]wedding ring on the stranger's [56]nightstand.
   She rides back up to retrieve it, but the elevator doors open on the
   figure of a large, imposing blonde woman in dark sunglasses wielding a
   straight razor. She slashes Kate to death in the elevator.

   [57]Prostitute Liz Blake ([58]Nancy Allen) happens upon the body and
   catches a glimpse of the killer, therefore becoming both the prime
   suspect and the killer's next target. Dr. Elliott receives a bizarre
   answering machine message from "Bobbi", a transsexual he is treating.
   Bobbi taunts Dr. Elliott for breaking off their therapy sessions,
   apparently because Dr. Elliott refuses to sign the necessary papers for
   Bobbi to get a [59]sex change operation. Elliott eventually becomes
   desperate, visiting Bobbi's new psychiatrist and trying to convince him
   that Bobbi is a danger to herself and others.

   Meanwhile, the police are less than willing to believe Liz's story, and
   she joins forces with Kate's son Peter to expose the killer. Peter
   ([60]Keith Gordon) is an inventor, and he uses a series of homemade
   listening devices and time-lapse cameras to track patients from
   Elliott's office. They catch Bobbi on camera leaving Elliott's office,
   but Liz is being stalked by a tall blonde figure in a wig and
   sunglasses. Bobbi makes several attempts on her life, one of them being
   thwarted by Peter, who rescues Liz in the nick of time by spraying
   Bobbi in the [61]New York City Subway with some homemade [62]mace.

   Finally Liz and Peter scheme to get into Elliott's office to look at
   his appointment book and get Bobbi's name. Liz baits Dr. Elliott by
   coming on to him, and distracts him long enough to make a brief exit
   and rifle through his appointment book. When she returns, Bobbi rather
   than Elliott confronts her; they are the same person. Elliott/Bobbi is
   shot and wounded by the female police officer who looks like Bobbi and
   has been trailing Liz. Liz recognizes the female cop as the tall blonde
   figure who was tracking her all along. Elliott is arrested by the
   police and placed in an [63]insane asylum. It is explained by a
   psychiatrist that Elliott wanted to be a woman, but his "male" side
   wouldn't allow him to go through with the operation. Whenever a woman
   sexually aroused Elliott, "Bobbi", who represents the female side of
   the doctor's personality, became threatened and killed the source of
   contention. In the film's final sequence, Elliott escapes from the
   asylum and slashes Liz in the throat in a bloody act of vengeance, and
   she wakes up screaming, realizing that Elliot's attack was just a
   dream.

[[88]edit] Trivia

   [89]Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please
   [90]relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or
   articles. (September 2008)
     * The film was the target of mild controversy when it became known
       that the nude body in the opening scene, taking place in a shower,
       was not that of Angie Dickinson but of [91]Penthouse model Victoria
       Lynn.^[92][1] This controversy stemmed mostly from Dickinson's
       status at the time as being a mature, still-slender and shapely,
       sex symbol; the provocative shower scene - and the film -
       originally seemed to cash in on the idea that this nude body was
       that of its star. However, this revelation of a body-double (a
       theme later explored by director De Palma in his 1984 release,
       [93]Body Double) seemed to do no harm to its [94]box office
       performance.

     * There were two versions of the film, an [95]R rated version and an
       unrated version. The unrated version was only longer by seconds
       that showed more genitalia in the above-mentioned shower scene and
       more blood in the elevator scene.

     * Both [96]Sean Connery and [97]Liv Ullmann were approached in early
       1979 by De Palma to appear as Elliot and Kate, but both passed on
       the project.

     * [98]William Finley, of DePalma's [99]Sisters and [100]Phantom of
       the Paradise, provides the telephone voice of Bobbi.

     * Actress [101]Rachel Ticotin ([102]Total Recall, [103]Falling Down)
       receives an early screen credit as a production assistant on this
       movie.

     * In an episode of [104]The Golden Girls ("Dorthy's New Friend"), a
       reference to the film is made when it is joked about how Blanche
       used to tell people, and even put in her resume, that she was Angie
       Dickinson's body-double in the shower scene.

     * In the comic strip [105]Doonesbury the title character [106]Mike
       Doonesbury and his future wife (and Ex Wife.) [107]JJ Doonesbury
       went to see the film on their first date.
