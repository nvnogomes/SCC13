[[15]edit] Biography

   Edward Garvey graduated from the [16]University of Wisconsin-Madison
   and spent two years in the [17]U.S. Army; he then returned to the
   [18]University of Wisconsin Law School and earned a [19]law degree.
   Soon after graduation, Garvey joined Lindquist and Vennum, a
   [20]Minneapolis [21]law firm. The firm worked for the [22]National
   Football League's players' [23]union, and in 1970 Garvey was assigned
   to counsel union president [24]John Mackey regarding negotiations on a
   new four year [25]contract with the league's owners. Garvey was later
   offered the position of [26]executive director in the reorganized
   union, the [27]National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) in
   1971. Garvey served as its executive director until 1983, through two
   [28]strikes (in 1974 and 1982) and frequently invoking [29]antitrust
   legislation in his many court battles with the league. Garvey directed
   the NFLPA though a series of court battles that led, in 1975, to the
   ruling in [30]Mackey v. NFL that antitrust laws applied to the NFL's
   restrictions on player movement. In 1976, armed with leverage regarding
   player movement from team to team, Garvey and the union won major
   concessions from the owners. Garvey's negotiations with the league
   exchanged the players' threat of pursuing a system of unfettered
   [31]free agency for an improved package of player benefits. The NFLPA
   became recognized by the owners as a full-fledged [32]National Labor
   Relations Board union, and damages totalling $13.65 million were
   awarded to past and present players for antitrust violations against
   them.

   After leaving the NFLPA, Garvey served as deputy [33]attorney general
   in [34]Wisconsin under [35]Bronson La Follette, specializing in
   [36]environmental issues. Garvey also became a prominent leader with
   Wisconsin labor groups, particularly the Paperworkers Union (now
   [37]United Steelworkers) in contract disputes with [38]International
   Paper.

[[39]edit] Political career

   Garvey is the editor and publisher of the political website
   FightingBob.com, focusing on Wisconsin and national issues from a
   [40]center-left perspective. He regularly appears on the local [41]NPR
   national public radio affiliate [42]WHAD to provide a progressive
   viewpoint on a variety of topics. Garvey continues to be a defining
   voice in Wisconsin politics and is popular in reform circles.

   In 1986, Garvey ran for the [43]U.S. Senate from Wisconsin, losing to
   Republican incumbent [44]Bob Kasten. In an unsuccessful bid for
   Wisconsin governor in 1998 against three-term [45]incumbent [46]Tommy
   G. Thompson, Garvey sought to highlight [47]campaign finance reform and
   limited contributions to his campaign to a fixed amount per donor.

   Currently, Garvey is active in his private law practice in [48]Madison,
   Wisconsin.
