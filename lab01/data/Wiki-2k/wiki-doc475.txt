[[32]edit] Plot

   A Kobheerian freighter requests permission to dock at [33]Deep Space 9,
   stating that one of its passengers requires treatment for a condition
   known as Kalla-Nohra. [34]Dr. Bashir is not familiar with the
   condition, but [35]Major Kira recognizes it and informs [36]Sisko that
   the only place to contract Kalla-Nohra was a [37]mining accident at a
   particularly brutal labor camp called Gallitepp. As Kira helped
   liberate the camp at the end of the [38]Cardassian occupation of
   [39]Bajor, she asks to greet the passenger personally.

   Upon arriving in Sickbay, Kira discovers that Bashir's new patient is
   not Bajoran but Cardassian. She has the man arrested as a [40]war
   criminal, only to find his name, Aamin Marritza, is not listed for any
   crimes. Sisko sees no option but to let Marritza go, yet Kira is
   adamantMarritza is Cardassian who was present at Gallitepp, she
   insists, which is reason enoughand details the condition of the labor
   camp when she liberated it. Sisko decides to investigate further.

   Further suspicions arise when Marritza claims he has never been to
   Bajor, an obvious lie as Bashir's medical test confirms that the man
   has Kalla-Nohra. Citing a [41]conflict of interest, Sisko asks Kira to
   remove herself from the case, but her emotional plea convinces him to
   let her stay on it. When she interrogates Marritza, he claims that,
   while he did serve at Gallitepp, he was only a [42]file clerk. He
   maintains the [43]atrocities the Bajorans believe occurred at Gallitep
   were an illusion meant to keep other Bajorans in fear of the
   Cardassians.

   An investigation corroborates Marritza's story, forcing Kira to cope
   with the possibility he may go free. A photograph from Gallitepp,
   however, reveals that the man being held is not Aamin Marritza but
   rather [44]Gul Darhe'el, the "Butcher of Gallitepp" who reportedly
   murdered thousands of innocent Bajorans. The prisoner responds
   arrogantly when confronted with this information; not only does he
   admit he is Darhe'el, but he boasts that "My word, my every glance was
   law! And the verdict was always the same: guilty." Kira is visibly
   shaken.

   As the episode progresses, Darhe'el lets slip the name of Kira's
   resistance cell during the occupationinformation far too obscure for
   him to know. Other inconsistencies in his story begin to stand out,
   leading Kira to realize that the prisoner wanted not only to be caught
   but to be recognized as Darhe'el. Security chief [45]Odo discovers that
   the real Darhe'el died five years prior and realizes the man he is
   holding is in fact Marritza, Darhe'el's clerk. Kira confronts the
   prisoner, whose guise begins to falter:
   I am alive. I will always be alive! It's Marritza who's dead! Marritza,
   who was good for nothing but cowering under his bunk and weeping like a
   woman. Who every night covered his ears because he couldn't bear to
   hear the screaming... for mercy... of the Bajorans...

   Marritza breaks down as he speaks, branding himself a coward. He begs
   Kira to prosecute him, insisting that Cardassia must be forced to admit
   its wrongdoings (cf. [46]Holocaust denial) and that he is as guilty for
   remaining silent as Darhe'el was for committing the atrocities. Kira
   releases him, insisting that another murder is not the answer, but as
   Marritza is about to depart from the station, he is [47]stabbed and
   killed by a drunken Bajoran. When Kira demands to know why, the Bajoran
   echoes her own earlier sentiment: being a Cardassian is reason enough.
   "No," Kira realizes, "it's not."
   [48]Darhe'el defends his actions
   (Submit) Play sound
   The prisoner justifies the occupation and accompanying [49]genocide.

[[51]edit] Background

   The episode features significant [52]character development on the part
   of [53]Kira Nerys and is the first episode in which the Cardassian
   occupation of Bajor was firmly established as a metaphor for the
   [54]Nazi persecution of the [55]Jews.^[56][1] From a [57]pitch titled
   "The Higher Law"^[58][2] about a [59]dramatization of the [60]Nuremberg
   Trials, Fields and [61]Ira Steven Behr) reshaped the story's focus to
   resemble [62]Robert Shaw's [63]The Man in the Glass Booth, which tells
   of a Jewish man who is accused of being a Nazi war criminal.^[64][3]
   The interrogation scenes between Kira and Marritza, particularly an
   exchange wherein Marritza shifts the focus to Kira's personal life and
   reverses the interrogation process, have been further compared to
   exchanges between [65]Jodie Foster's character and [66]Hannibal Lecter
   ([67]Anthony Hopkins) in [68]The Silence of the Lambs.^[69][4]
   Maritzza's first name, Aamin, is pronounced similarly to the Nazi,
   [70]Amon Gth's. Gth was the leader of the [71]Paszw
   Labour/Concentration Camp in Poland. He gained international fame from
   his movie portrayal in [72]Schindler's List.

   Despite being a [73]bottle episode, "Duet" was featured in [74]Museum
   of Television and Radio's 1994 "Tribute to Excellence"^[75][3] and
   became a fan favorite, described by Startrek.com as "one of DS9s
   possibly even one of Treks finest [hours]".^[76][5] It was included in
   several editors' choices for a feature there entitled "You're Stranded
   on a Desert Asteroid ... Our Best of the Best Episodes", described by
   editor Sandy Stone as "when I knew DS9 really had something going
   on".^[77][6] The episode "is all substance, completely engrossing in
   its conveyance, and it also features a tragic ending" according to
   Jammer's Reviews, an independent science fiction portal.^[78][7] "I'm
   not sure I can write a coherent analysis of this episode," Michelle
   Erica Green of the popular fan site The Trek Nation began her review in
   [79]2004. "I cried just thinking about it for two days after I saw it,
   and I still cry when I try to discuss it."^[80][1] It has nonetheless
   been noted by some fans that certain parts of the [81]exposition appear
   rushed, while the believability of Marritza's death scene has been
   questioned.^[82][8] This can be attributed to the need to contain the
   episode, as the episode is "hardly [a] story worthy of a
   [83]multi-episode arc".^[84][9]

   Cast and crew responded positively to the episode as well. In the Star
   Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion, [85]Armin Shimerman ([86]Quark)
   observed that the episode works because of "the writing and the
   directing and the acting all coalescing perfectly", which [87]Nana
   Visitor (Kira) believed was because it had "such important things to
   say".^[88][10] Notable staff to list it among their favorites are
   Behr,^[89][11] [90]Next Generation producer [91]Dave Rossi^[92][12] and
   Companion author Terry J. Erdmann.^[93][10]

   The producers of [94]Star Trek: Voyager attempted to re-create the
   critical success of "Duet" with their first-season episode
   "[95]Jetrel". According to [96]DVD commentary accompanying Voyagers
   second season, "Jetrel" was a conscious effort to use a similar
   delivery to create a metaphor for the aftermath of the [97]atomic
   bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In that episode, the character
   [98]Neelix is forced to confront the scientist who developed a weapon
   which eradicated millions of Neelix's people.
