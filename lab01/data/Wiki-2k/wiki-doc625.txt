   long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91, is an
   [15]EU regulation which went into effect on [16]2005-[17]02-18. It sets
   out the entitlements of air passengers when a [18]flight that they

   boarding to such a flight due to [19]overbooking, or when the airline
   is unable to accommodate them in the [20]class they had booked.

[[36]edit] Applicability

   The regulation applies to any passenger:
     * departing from an airport located in the territory of a Member
       State to which the Treaty applies;
     * The protection accorded to passengers departing from an airport
       located in a Member State should be extended

   to those leaving an airport located in a third country for one situated
   in a Member State, when a Community carrier operates the flight.
     * departing from an [37]EU member state, or
     * travelling to an EU member state on an airline based in an EU
       member state if that person has:
     * a confirmed reservation on the flight, and
     * arrived in time for check-in as indicated on the ticket or
       communication from the airline, or, if no time is so indicated, no
       less than 45 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time of the
       flight

   or
     * have been transferred from the flight for which he/she held a
       reservation to some other flight

   unless
     * the passenger is travelling on a free or discounted ticket not
       available to the general public, other than a ticket obtained from
       a [38]frequent flyer programme.

   It does not apply to [39]helicopter flights, to any flight not operated
   by a fixed-wing [40]aircraft, or within [41]Gibraltar.

[[42]edit] Denied boarding

   Before denying passengers boarding involuntarily, the airline is
   required to first seek volunteers to give up their reservation in
   return for whatever benefit is negotiated between the airline and the
   volunteers. Irrespective of such negotiation, such volunteers are also
   entitled to reimbursement or rerouting as described below.

   If insufficient volunteers are obtained, the airline may then proceed
   to involuntarily deny passengers the right to board their flight. All
   passengers so denied must be offered all three types of compensation
   and assistance described below.

[[43]edit] Cancellation

   If a flight is cancelled, passengers are automatically entitled to
   their choice of (a.) re-routing to the same destination at the earliest
   opportunity (under comparable conditions); (b.) later rerouting, at the
   passenger's convenience, to the same destination under comparable
   conditions (subject to seat availability); or (c.) a refund of the
   ticket as well as a return flight to the point of first departure, when
   relevant. Any ticket refund is the price paid for the flight(s) not
   used, plus the cost of flights already flown in cases where the
   cancellation has made those flights of no purpose. Where applicable,
   passengers are also entitled to refreshments, communication and
   accommodation as described below. Where re-routing is to another
   airport serving the same destination, the airline must pay for onward
   transport to the original airport or to a close-by destination agreed
   with the passenger. These choices, and the entitlement to refreshments,
   etc., apply to all cancellations, regardless of whether the
   circumstances are extraordinary or not.

   The airline is also required to pay cash compensation as described
   below, unless one of the following conditions applies:
     * the airline notifies the passengers at least two weeks prior to
       departure
     * the airline notifies the passengers between one and two weeks prior
       to departure, and re-routes passengers so that they can:
          + depart no more than two hours earlier than scheduled, and
          + arrive no more than four hours later than scheduled
     * the airline notifies the passengers less than one week prior to
       departure, and re-routes passengers so that they can:
          + depart no more than one hour earlier than scheduled, and
          + arrive no more than two hours later than scheduled
     * the cancellation was caused by extraordinary circumstances that
       could not have been avoided by any reasonable measure.

   The airline must also provide an explanation to passengers of
   alternative transport.

[[44]edit] Delays

   If an airline expects a flight to be delayed, passengers are entitled
   to refreshments and communication if the expected delay is more than:
     * two hours, in the case of a type 1 flight
     * three hours, in the case of a type 2 flight
     * four hours, in the case of a type 3 flight

   (see [45]notes for flight types).

   Additionally, if the flight is expected to depart on the day after the
   original scheduled departure time, passengers are entitled to
   accommodation.

   If a flight is delayed by five hours, passengers are additionally
   entitled to abandon their journey and receive a refund for all unused
   tickets, a refund on tickets used already if the flight no longer
   serves any purpose in relation to their original travel plan, and, if
   relevant, a flight back to their original point of departure at the
   earliest opportunity.

[[46]edit] Compensation and assistance

   There are three broad categories of compensation and assistance that
   may be required in the case of cancellations, delays, or denied
   boarding.

[[47]edit] Cash compensation

   Cash compensation is a payment of:
    1. 250, for a flight of less than 1500 km
    2. 400, for flight within the EU of greater than 1500 km in distance,
       or any other flight of greater than 1500 km but less than 3500 km
       in distance
    3. 600, for a flight not within EU of greater than 3500 km in distance
       where flight types are as defined in [48]notes. Where rerouting is
       offered and results in the passenger arriving within two/three/four
       hours of the scheduled arrival time for a type 1/2/3 flight, the
       compensation payable is halved.

   This payment is strictly a compensation for the customer's
   inconvenience and does not replace or form a part of either of the
   following two compensation categories.

[[49]edit] Rerouting or refunding

   Rerouting or refunding is, at the passenger's choice, one of the
   following three compensations:
    1. Repayment of the cost of unused flight tickets, and for used
       tickets where the flight(s) taken no longer serve(s) any purpose in
       relation to the passenger's original travel plan, and where
       applicable, a flight back to the original point of departure at the
       earliest opportunity
    2. Rerouting under similar conditions to the intended final
       destination at the earliest opportunity
    3. Rerouting under similar conditions to the intended final
       destination at the passenger's leisure, subject to the availability
       of seats.

   If a passenger's destination is an airport at a city with multiple
   airports and rerouting results in the passenger being taken to another
   of those airports, the airline must also pay for transport for the
   passenger to the original intended airport or an agreed nearby
   destination.

[[50]edit] Refreshments, communication and accommodation

   When passengers become entitled to these assistances, they must be
   offered, free of charge,
     * Meals and refreshments in proportion to the waiting time
     * Two telephone calls, fax or telex messages, or emails
     * Hotel accommodation and transport between the airport and the
       hotel, if a stay of one or more nights, or a stay additional to
       that intended by the passenger becomes necessary

   In the case of a delay, the airline may withdraw or abrogate these
   entitlements if offering them would delay the flight further.

[[51]edit] Upgrades and downgrades

   If a passenger is placed in a higher class than that for which a ticket
   was purchased, the airline may not request any additional payment.

   If a passenger is placed in a lower class than that for which a ticket
   was purchased, the airline must refund 30/50/75% of the cost of the
   ticket for type 1/2/3 flights (see [52]notes). For the purpose of this
   condition, flights to the [53]French overseas departments are not
   considered to be within the European Union.

[[54]edit] Method of refund

   Refunds payable under this regulation may be paid in [55]cash, by
   electronic [56]bank transfer, [57]bank draft, or [58]cheque. With the
   signed agreement of a passenger, they may also be paid in travel
   vouchers or other services.

[[59]edit] Obligation to notify passengers

   Airlines are obliged to display a notice at their check-in counters
   stating:

          "If you are denied boarding or if your flight is cancelled or
          delayed for at least two hours, ask at the check-in counter or
          boarding gate for the text stating your rights, particularly
          with regard to compensation and assistance."

   Additionally, when an airline cancels a flight, denies a person
   boarding, or incurs a delay exceeding two hours to a flight, it is
   obliged to provide each passenger affected with a written notice
   setting out their rights under the regulation, and the contact details
   of the national body tasked with enforcing the regulation.

[[60]edit] Notes

   Flight types are as follows:
    1. A flight of less than 1500 km in distance
    2. A flight within the EU of greater than 1500 km in distance, or any
       other flight of greater than 1500km but less than 3500 km in
       distance
    3. A flight not within EU of greater than 3500 km in distance

   with the [61]great circle method being used to determine distance.

[[62]edit] European Court of Justice Luxembourg

   Case Wallentin-Hermann v. AlitaliaLinee Aeree Italiane SpA (Case
   C-549/07), December, 22, 2008. Regulation 5 (EC) No 261/2004, European
   Court of Justice in Luxembourg: Case Wallentin-Hermann v AlitaliaLinee
   Aeree Italiane SpA (Case C-549/07), December, 22, 2008. Justice agreed
   that any technical issues during aircraft maintenance dont constitute
   extraordinary circumstances that would allow airlines to avoid paying
   passengers compensation for canceled flights. Justice agreed that any
   technical issues during aircraft maintenance dont constitute
   extraordinary circumstances that would allow airlines to avoid paying
   passengers compensation for canceled flights. The European Tribunal of
   Justice (EJC) in December 2008, in Wallentin-Hermann case closed the
   loophole of always abused frivolous interpretations used by the
   airlines of technical or extraordinary circumstances, when further
   defined and limited the use of such defense. Finally the definition of
   technical and / or extraordinary circumstances by the ECJ court now
   stands firm and solid. Any carrier must prove that the alleged
   mechanical problem leading to the cancellation was beyond its actual
   control, the court affirmed in a statement.
 In its judgment, the Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice held:

   Extraordinary circumstances was not defined in the 2004 Regulation, but
   the phrase was to be interpreted narrowly since article 5(3)
   constituted a derogation from the principle, indicated in recitals 1
   and 2 of the preamble, of protection of consumers, in as much as
   cancellation of flights caused serious inconvenience to passengers.
