   Fazl Kk, Vice-President of the Republic of Cyprus (1959-1963)

   Fazl Kk ([9]1906 - [10]January 15, [11]1984) was the first [12]Turkish
   Cypriot Vice President of the [13]Republic of Cyprus.

   Fazl Kk, the son of a farmer, was born in [14]Nicosia in 1906. After
   graduating from the Turkish High School in Nicosia, Kk went on to study
   medicine at the Universities of [15]Istanbul, [16]Lausanne and
   [17]Paris. Having returned to Cyprus in 1937, he started a practice,
   but his interest in politics soon led to him to become a voice for
   Turkish Cypriot rights. In 1941 Kk founded the newspaper Halkin Sesi
   (The Voice of the People) and became the managing editor. Due to his
   campaign against the [18]British colonial administration, his paper was
   not given a permit for publication until 1942, the paper is still being
   published in [19]TRNC to this day.

   In 1943, he became one of the founders of the Kbrs Adas; Trk Aznlk
   Kurumu (Association of the Turkish Minority of the Island of Cyprus -
   known as KATAK). The aim of the party was to promote the social,
   economic and political well being of the Turkish Cypriot people. Due to
   disagreements with some of its members, Kk parted with KATAK and
   established the Kbrs Trk Milli Birlik Partisi (Turkish Cypriot National
   Union Party). Following a 15 year struggle, Kk helped for the transfer
   of the Evkaf (a Turkish religious fund) from British to Turkish Cypriot
   control.

   During the [20]1959 London and Zurich Conferences for the creation of
   an independent Republic of Cyprus, Kk represented the Turkish Cypriot
   community and was able to secure constitutional safeguards for the
   people. On [21]December 3, [22]1959 Kk was elected Vice President of
   the new Republic. Following [23]Greek Cypriot attempts to modify the
   constitution (see [24]Cyprus dispute). Kk continued as the Vice
   President of the Republic of Cyprus until 1973 when he was sidelined by
   [25]Rauf Denkta;. Despite ill health, Kk continued to support Turkish
   Cypriots through his Halkn Sesi newspaper.

   Dr. Kk died in a [26]Westminster hospital on [27]January 15, [28]1984,
   less than a year after the [29]Unilateral declaration of Independence
   of the [30]Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
