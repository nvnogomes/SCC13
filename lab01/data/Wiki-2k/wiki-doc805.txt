[[39]edit] History

   Map of Ottawa showing the francophone concentrations

   Opened in 1972, the school was named in honour of the French Canadian
   politician, poet, and historian [40]Franois-Xavier Garneau of the 19th
   century.^[41][1]

[[42]edit] Building

   Garneau is sometimes known as "The Bomb Shelter", "The Lego
   Block","GarnBarn" or "Clown School" because of its angular and box like
   shape, as well as its diversified color scheme. The name "GarnBarn" has
   a double meaning, referring to both the shape of the school as well as
   the living conditions. A few myths surround the school, such as the
   existence of an underground bomb shelter, which may or may not have
   been included in the construction plans in the [43]1970s, devised at
   the peak of the Cold War. Another myth is that the current library was
   designed as a swimming pool, explaining the large windows and small
   adjacent rooms that could have been changing rooms. The front is
   actually the back, when they moved the school from one side to the
   other in the blueprints, they forgot to flip it.

   In 2001, construction of a new addition onto Garneau was due in part to
   expanding demographics, government budget cuts and the transformation
   of a nearby [44]francophone intermediate school named Lo-D-Ct into an
   elementary school named St Joseph d'Orlans.

[[45]edit] Economic

   Funding is constantly being raised for prom. Students embark in diverse
   activities to collect funds for grad.In a related note, prices in the
   pop machines have raised by almost 50% in two years.Some say this is
   caused by a strong economic crisis in the school.

[[46]edit] Geography

   Garneau is located in a highly Francophone area (See map of Ottawa
   showing the francophone concentrations). To the east of Garneau is the
   [47]Mouvement d'implication Francophone d'Orlans (MIFO), an
   organisation that has continuously encouraged Francophone culture
   within the community of Orlans.

   In April 2008, according to the [48]City of Ottawa, Garneau was located
   in the Innes ward, previously known as "Old Ward no. 2"^[49][2] The
   property area consisted of 20.22 acres (81,800 m^2) and was legally
   described as "CON 2 OF PT LOT 3".^[50][2]

[[51]edit] School boards

   Garneau is listed under the [52]Conseil des coles catholiques de langue
   franaise du Centre-Est (CECLFCE).^[53][3] However, according to the
   Ontario government the official name of Garneau's School board, or more
   precisely the CECLFCE, is the Conseil scolaire de district catholique
   du Centre-Est de l'Ontario.^[54][4] In fact both school board names
   correspond to the same physical address.^[55][5]

[[56]edit] Parks

   Garneau High School has several surrounding parks and fields which are
   regularly used by students and east-end athletic associations. In 2007
   the [57]Orlans Bengals and [58]Gloucester Dukes football clubs had
   publicly complained about the [59]mosquito infestation within the
   east-end [60]Ottawa fields, especially the Garneau fields.^[61][6]
   Innes Councilor [62]Rainer Bloess jokingly stated in a press conference
   that he "went up to visit and see if they really had a problem or if
   they were just being wimps."^[63][6] He also stated that "after being
   with them [athletic or football associations] for five minutes I beat a
   hasty retreat back to my van and spoke to them through a little crack
   in the window... enough to convince me that the location is obviously a
   prime mosquito location." In June 2007, Councilors Bloess, [64]Rob
   Jellett and [65]Bob Monette agreed to a year-long pilot program to
   reduce the amount of mosquito larvae by possibly using biological
   protein crystals produced by naturally-occurring bacteria called
   [66]Bti.^[67][6]

[[68]edit] Programs offered

[[69]edit] CCNA Cisco courses and computers

   Garneau offers a variety of specialized courses including programming
   and economics in addition to traditional coursework. Garneau and
   [70]Cisco Systems have paired together to offer the students of grade
   10, 11 and 12 a college-level [71]Cisco [72]CCNA networking course. The
   Cisco Networking Academy Program lists 114 Secondary Schools and 29
   Colleges as participating schools.^[73][7] Garneau, however, is listed
   under the official school board's name the Conseil scolaire de district
   catholique du Centre-Est de l'Ontario.^[74][7] The Cisco 3 class was
   split into Cisco 3 and Cisco 4 classes , andding further depth and time
   into the program.

[[75]edit] GuG

   Known as Groupe Utilisateur Garneau,^[76][8] this group of students
   [77]playtest's and evaluate's products given by computer and software
   companies. A magazine with all the products tested is made every 6
   months, and sent to their sponsors.

   The GuG is the only high school student administered member of the
   [78]Association of Personal Computer User Groups (APCUG). This
   internationally recognized association consists of more than 400 user
   groups throughout the world. Unfortunately, because of a low school
   budget, the school does not promote the program like it did in the
   past. Many students could recall hearing about the program but never
   got the chance to participate.

[[79]edit] Graduation

[[80]edit] 2007

   In June 2007 l'cole secondaire catholique Garneau, under the direction
   of Mme. Vidosa, publicly congratulated all of its finishing 2006-2007
   graduates by publishing their names in a local news paper called
   l'Express. The convocation took place at [81]l'glise Saint-Joseph
   d'Orlans on the [82]21^st of June [83]2007.^[84][9] 35 prizes and
   bursaries totaling approximately 15000$, gathered from within the
   [85]Orlans, Ontario community, were awarded to distinguished
   students.^[86][9] According to the press release, many students
   received study and admission awards from post secondary
   institutions.^[87][9]
