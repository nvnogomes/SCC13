[[33]edit] Biography

[[34]edit] Early life and education

   Her passport reads Mary Edmonia Lewis, born in July 1845 in [35]Albany,
   New York, although the exact date of her birth is uncertain. Her
   inspiration for much her artwork came from her ethnic background.
   Lewis' father was Haitian of African descent, while her mother was of
   [36]Mississauga Ojibwe and African descent.^[37][2]^:12 Lewis mother
   was known as an excellent weaver and craftswoman.^[38][2]^:15

   When Lewis was around nine years old, both of her parents died within a
   year of each other.^[39][2]^:18 Lewis and her older brother, Samuel,
   lived with their mothers sisters for the next three years. Lewis and
   her aunts sold Ojibwe baskets and other crafts to tourists visiting
   Niagara Falls, Toronto, and Buffalo.^[40][2]^:19 Samuel became a
   successful businessman and gold prospector and paid for her tuition to
   the [41]New York Central College.^[42][2]^:19 Lewis was rebellious and
   did not learn English well, so Samuel suggested she transfer to
   [43]Oberlin College, outside of [44]Cleveland, Ohio.^[45][2]^:20

   At the time, Oberlin College was one of the first higher learning
   institutions in the United States to admit women of different races.
   Lewis' decision to attend Oberlin was one that would significantly
   change her life, as that is where Lewis began her art studies. ^[46][3]

[[47]edit] Incident at Oberlin College

   During the winter season of 1862, just several months after the start
   of the Civil War, while Edmonia Lewis attended Oberlin College, there
   was an incident, which involved her and two classmates, Maria Miles and
   Christina Ennes. The three women planned go sleigh riding later that
   day. Lewis invited her friends to her home for a drink. Shortly after,
   Miles and Ennes fell severely ill. Doctors concluded that the two women
   had some sort of poison in their system and were not sure if they would
   survive. Days later, it was apparent that the two women would recover
   from the incident, and, because of their recovery, the authorities took
   no action.

   However, townspeople took matters in their own hands. Walking home
   alone one night, Lewis was dragged into an open field and badly
   beaten.^[48][4] Those responsible for her injuries were never
   found.^[49][5] Due to the attack, local authorities arrested Lewis,
   charging her with poisoning her friends. The college defended their
   student throughout the trial. [50]John Mercer Langston, an Oberlin
   College alum, and only practicing African-American lawyer in Oberlin,
   represented Lewis during her trial. Although most witnesses spoke
   against Lewis and Lewis did not testify, Langston did an excellent job.
   Lewis was found not guilty of poisoning Miles and Ennes.^[51][4]

[[52]edit] Art career

   After college, Lewis moved to Boston late in 1863.^[53][2]^:41 She
   began to study under a well-known and developed sculptor, Edmund
   Brackett. Under his tutelage, Lewis crafted her own sculpting tools and
   sold her first piece, a sculptor of a womans hand, for $8.^[54][2]^:43
   She opened her studio to the public in her first solo exhibit in
   1864.^[55][2]^:44

   She found inspiration in the lives of [56]Abolitionists and Civil War
   heroes. Lewis met Union Colonel [57]Robert Gould Shaw, the commander of
   an [58]African American Civil War regiment from Massachusetts. She was
   inspired to create a bust of his likeness, which impressed the Shaw
   family, who purchased her homage.^[59][2]^:46-9 Poet Anna Quincy
   Waterston was inspired to write a poem about both Lewis and
   Shaw.^[60][2]^:49

   Early works that proved highly popular included medallion portraits of
   the abolitionists [61]John Brown and [62]William Lloyd Garrison. Lewis
   also drew inspiration from [63]Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his work,
   particularly his epic poem, "[64]The Song of Hiawatha"

   Lewis was determined to sculpt in Rome and sailed there in
   1865.^[65][2]^:53 ^[66][3] Established sculptor [67]Hiram Powers gave
   Lewis space in his studio.^[68][2]^:53 She entered a circle of
   expatriate artists and established her own space within the former
   studio of 18th century Italian sculptor [69]Antonio Canova.^[70][2]^:55

   Rome was where Lewis spent most of her adult career. Her studies there
   contributed to her [71]neoclassical techniques and subject matter. Her
   surroundings of the classical world greatly inspired Lewis and
   influenced her work. Lewis recreated the classical art style in her own
   work. For instance, she presented people in her sculptures as draped in
   robes rather than in contemporary clothing.^[72][6]

   Her work sold for large sums of money. In 1873 an article in the New
   Orleans Picayune stated, Edmonia Lewis had snared two 50,000 dollar
   commissions. Her new-found popularity made her studio a tourist
   destination.^[73][7]

   Lewis had many major exhibitions during her rise to fame, including one
   in Chicago, Illinois in 1870, and in Rome in 1871. ^[74][3]

   A major coup in her career was participating in the 1876 [75]Centennial
   Exposition in Philadelphia.^[76][2]^:93 For this, she created a
   monumental 3,015-pound marble sculpture, The Death of Cleopatra, which
   dramatically portrayed the queen in the throes of death^[77][2]^:97,
   102 Of the piece, J. S. Ingraham wrote that [78]Cleopatra was the most
   remarkable piece of sculpture in the American section of the
   Exposition.^[79][2]^:97-99 Much the viewing public was shocked by Lewis
   frank portrayal of death, but the statue drew thousands of
   viewers.^[80][2]^:100 After being placed in storage, the statue went
   missing, and after 120 years and many strange locations, was discovered
   in a Sothebys auction, properly identified, and donated to the
   [81]Smithsonian American Art Museum.^[82][2]^:102-105

   A testament to her renown as an artist came in 1877, when former US
   President [83]Ulysses S. Grant commissioned her to do his portrait. He
   sat for her as a model and was pleased with her finished
   piece.^[84][2]^:108-109

   In the late 1880s, the neoclassical genre became less popular, and
   Lewis's popularity also declined. She still created works in marble,
   increasingly altarpieces and other works for Roman Catholic patrons. In
   the art world, she became eclipsed by history and lost fame. The events
   of her later years are not known. ^[85][3]

[[86]edit] Death

   The exact year of Edmonia Lewis death in uncertain. Records state she
   was still alive in 1909, and in 1911 she was seen in Rome. It is
   commonly believed she died in Rome, but an alternative view is that she
   died in Marin County, California and was buried in an unmarked grave in
   San Francisco.^[87][2]^:110 Lewis never married and had no known
   children.^[88][8]

[[89]edit] Her Work

[[90]edit] Descriptions of Her Most Popular Artworks

   Forever Free, 1867
   This sculpture is of white marble. It represents a man standing,
   staring up, and raising his left arm into the air. Wrapped around his
   left wrist is a chain; however, this chain is not restraining him
   whatsoever. To his right is a woman kneeling with her hands held in a
   prayer position. The mans right hand is gently placed on her right
   shoulder. Forever Free is a representation of the emancipation of
   African-American slaves after the Civil War. Lewis attempted to break
   stereotypes of African-American women with this sculpture. For example,
   Lewis portrayed the woman as completely dressed while the man was
   partially dressed. This drew attention away from the notion of
   African-American women being sexual and erotic figures. This sculpture
   is also a representation of the end of the Civil War. While
   African-Americans were technically free, they continued to be
   restrained, shown by the fact that the couple had chains wrapped around
   their bodies. This piece is at the [91]Howard University Gallery of Art
   in [92]Washington, D.C. ^[93][9]

   Hagar, 1875
   This sculpture inspired by a Biblical character from the Old Testament
   was made of white marble. It shows Hagar with her hands in prayer
   staring slightly up but not straight across. Hagar was the Egyptian
   wife of Abraham and gave birth to his first son Ishmael. Abrahams
   second wife, Sarah, resented Hagar and cast Hagar into the wilderness
   after the birth Sarahs son Isaac. Lewis uses the Egyptian Hagar as a
   representation of the African mother. Hagar symbolizes the abuse of
   African women. Lewis had a tendency to sculpt historically strong
   women. We see this not just in Hagar but also in Lewis's Cleopatra
   piece. Lewis also depicted regular women in great situations,
   emphasizing their strength. ^[94][8]

   Old Arrow-Maker and his Daughter, 1866
   This sculpture was inspired by Lewis's Native American heritage. It
   represents an arrow-maker and his daughter sitting on a round base.
   They are dressed in traditional Native American clothes and have
   typical Native American facial features. Lewis pushed the limits with
   the accuracy of her sculptures. Lewis never cleaned up or generalized
   the appearance of those represented in her sculptures. Instead, she
   found truth in the stereotypes and used that in her work. She wanted to
   be as realistic as possible.^[95][8]
