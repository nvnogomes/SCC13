   This article is about the U.S. Representative from Ohio. For the
   professor at Emory University, see [8]Earl Lewis.

   Earl Ramage Lewis ([9]February 22, [10]1887 - [11]February 1, [12]1956)
   was a [13]U.S. Representative from [14]Ohio.

   Born in [15]Lamira, Ohio, Lewis attended the public and high schools.
   He graduated from Muskingum College in [16]New Concord, Ohio, in 1911,
   and from the law department of [17]Western Reserve University,
   [18]Cleveland, Ohio, in 1914. He was [19]admitted to the bar the same
   year and commenced practice in [20]St. Clairsville, Ohio.

   He served as member of the [21]Ohio State Senate in 1927 and 1928, and
   then served as chairman of the Republican State campaign committee for
   Ohio in 1930. Continuing in politics, Lewis returned to the Ohio senate
   in 1931 and stayed until 1934, serving as [22]president pro tempore in
   1931 and 1932 and as Republican floor leader from 1931 to 1934. He also
   served as member of the Interstate Commission on Conflicting Taxation
   of the American Legislators Association from 1931 to 1935.

   After his time in the Ohio senate, Lewis was elected as a
   [23]Republican to the [24]Seventy-sixth Congress ([25]January 3,
   [26]1939-[27]January 3, [28]1941). After his unsuccessful run for
   reelection in 1940, he resumed the practice of law, but soon ran again.
   Lewis was elected to the [29]Seventy-eighth, [30]Seventy-ninth, and
   [31]Eightieth Congresses ([32]January 3, [33]1943-[34]January 3,
   [35]1949). He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1948, and
   again resumed the practice of law.

   Lewis later served as trustee of Muskingum College. He died in
   [36]Wheeling, West Virginia, and was interred in Union Cemetery in St.
   Clairsville, Ohio.
