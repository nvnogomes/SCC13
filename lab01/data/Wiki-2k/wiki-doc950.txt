[[51]edit] Early life

   Balls was born in [52]Norwich, [53]Norfolk and educated at Crossdale
   Drive Primary School in [54]Keyworth, [55]Notts and then the
   independent fee-paying boys [56]Nottingham High School. He studied
   [57]PPE at [58]Keble College, [59]Oxford, and later attended
   [60]Harvard University as a [61]Kennedy Scholar. He joined the Labour
   Party at the age of 16 but while at Oxford joined all the main
   political societies, including the [62]Conservative Association, so
   that he could "hear all the speeches at all the political
   clubs".^[63][1]

[[64]edit] Economist

   His career began as economic leader writer at the [65]Financial Times
   (199094) before his appointment as an economic adviser to the then
   shadow chancellor [66]Gordon Brown (199497).

   In 1994, in a speech written for Gordon Brown to give to an economics
   conference, he used the phrase "post [67]neoclassical [68]endogenous
   growth theory",^[69][2] which was picked up on and gleefully recounted
   later by [70]Michael Heseltine, who coined the humorous quip: "There
   you have it! The final proof. Labour's brand new, shining, modernists'
   economic dream. But it's not Brown's - it's Balls"^[71][3]

   As Labour swept to power in the [72]General Election of 1997 he
   continued as an economic adviser to Brown, who was then [73]Chancellor.
   He then served as chief economic adviser to [74]HM Treasury from 1999
   to 2004, in which post he was once named the 'most powerful unelected
   person in Britain'.^[75][4]

   In July 2004 he was selected to stand as Labour and Co-operative
   candidate for the parliamentary seat of [76]Normanton in [77]West
   Yorkshire, a Labour stronghold whose MP, [78]Bill O'Brien, was
   retiring. He stepped down as chief economic adviser to the Treasury,
   but was given a position at the [79]Smith Institute, a political
   [80]think tank with extremely close ties to Gordon Brown. He was
   reportedly paid 100,000 for less than a year's work.^[81][5]

[[82]edit] Member of Parliament

   In the [83]2005 general election he was elected MP for Normanton with a
   majority of 10,002 and 51.2% of the vote. The West Yorkshire seat has
   been occupied by Labour MPs for longer than any other constituency in
   the United Kingdom.^[[84]citation needed] It is, however, scheduled to
   disappear before the next election under the latest changes proposed by
   the [85]Boundary Commission. Balls ran a campaign, in connection with
   the local newspaper the [86]Wakefield Express, to save the seat and,
   together with the three other [87]Wakefield MPs (his wife [88]Yvette
   Cooper, [89]Mary Creagh and [90]Jon Trickett), fought an unsuccessful
   [91]High Court challenge against the Boundary Commission's proposals.

   In March 2007 he was selected to be the Labour Party candidate for the
   new [92]Morley and Outwood constituency, which contains part of the
   abolished [93]Normanton constituency and part of [94]Colin Challen's
   current [95]Morley and Rothwell constituency. In return for giving way
   to Balls, it was rumoured Gordon Brown offered Challen a job on an
   environmental think tank as well as a possible
   Lordship.^[96][6]^[97][7]^[98][8]

[[99]edit] Ministerial career

   Balls became [100]Economic Secretary to the Treasury, a junior
   ministerial position in [101]HM Treasury, in the government
   [102]reshuffle of May 2006. When Gordon Brown became [103]prime
   minister on 29 June 2007, Balls was promoted to [104]Secretary of State
   for Children, Schools and Families.

   In October 2008, Balls announced that the government had decided to
   scrap [105]SATs tests for 14-year-olds despite their consistent
   promises to the contrary,^[106][9] a move which was broadly welcomed by
   teachers, parent groups and [107]opposition MPs.^[108][10]^[109][11]
   However, the decision to continue with SATs tests for 11-year-olds was
   described by Head teachers' leader Mick Brookes as a missed
   opportunity.^[110][12]

[[111]edit] Political activities

   Balls has played a prominent role in the [112]Fabian Society, the think
   tank and political society founded in 1884 which helped to found the
   Labour Party in 1900. In 1992 he authored a Fabian pamphlet advocating
   [113]Bank of England independence, a policy that was swiftly enacted
   when Gordon Brown became Chancellor in 1997.

   Balls was elected Vice-Chair of the Fabian Society for 2006 and Chair
   of the Fabian Society for 2007. As Vice-Chair of the Fabian Society, he
   launched the Fabian Life Chances Commission report in April
   2006^[114][13] and opened the Society's Next Decade lecture series in
   November 2006,^[115][14] arguing for closer European cooperation on the
   environment. Balls had previously been seen as being a eurosceptic, in
   Labour party terms, because of his opposition to the euro and the EU
   constitution.

   Balls has been a central figure in New Labour's economic reform agenda.
   But he and Gordon Brown have differed from the [116]Blairites in being
   keen to stress their roots in Labour party intellectual traditions such
   as Fabianism and the co-operative movement as well as their modernising
   credentials in policy and electoral terms. In a [117]New Statesman
   interview in March 2006, [118]Martin Bright writes that Balls "says the
   use of the term "socialist" is less of a problem for his generation
   than it has been for older politicians like Blair and Brown, who remain
   bruised by the ideological warfare of the 1970s and 1980s".^[119][15]

   "When I was at college, the economic system in eastern Europe was
   crumbling. We didn't have to ask the question of whether we should
   adopt a globally integrated, market-based model. For me, it is now a
   question of what values you have. Socialism, as represented by the
   Labour Party, the Fabian Society, the Co-operative movement, is a
   tradition I can be proud of", Balls told the New Statesman.^[120][15]

[[121]edit] Allegation over allowances

   In September 2007, with his wife [122]Yvette Cooper, he was accused of
   "breaking the spirit of Commons rules" by using MPs' allowances to help
   pay for a 655,000 home in north London.^[123][16] It was alleged that
   they bought a four-bed house in [124]Stoke Newington, north London, and
   registered this as their second home (rather than their home in
   [125]Castleford, West Yorkshire) in order to qualify for up to 44,000 a
   year to subsidise a reported 438,000 mortgage under the Commons
   Additional Costs Allowance. This is despite both spouses working in
   London full-time and their children attending local London schools.
   Through a spokesman, Balls and Cooper countered the allegation by
   saying "The whole family travel between their Yorkshire home and London
   each week when Parliament is sitting. As they are all in London during
   the week, their children have always attended the nearest school to
   their London house."

[[126]edit] Commons outburst

   In March 2008, Balls sparked controversy by appearing to reply to
   [127]David Cameron's assertion in parliament that the government had
   presided over the greatest increase in overall taxation of all time
   with the phrase "So what?" Balls maintained that he had said "So
   weak!", in response to Cameron's previous questioning, and this was the
   phrase that was recorded in the parliamentary register Hansard, but the
   incident remained highly controversial,^[128][17] particularly as the
   offending clip can be viewed on the [129]YouTube website where Balls'
   comment is not clearly audible.^[130][18]

[[131]edit] Personal life

   He married [132]Yvette Cooper MP, the [133]Chief Secretary to the
   Treasury, in [134]Eastbourne on 10 January 1998. Cooper is [135]Member
   of Parliament for [136]Normanton's neighbouring constituency of
   [137]Pontefract and Castleford, so together they form one of five sets
   of married couples in the [138]Commons ([139]Nicholas Winterton and
   [140]Ann Winterton; [141]Andrew Mackay and [142]Julie Kirkbride;
   [143]Peter Robinson and [144]Iris Robinson; [145]Alan Keen and [146]Ann
   Keen - to this could be added [147]Gordon Prentice and [148]Bridget
   Prentice who entered the Commons as husband and wife, but have been
   divorced for many years). They have three children: Meriel Eliza
   (Ellie, born July 1999), Joel Thomas (Joe, born 24 August
   2001^[149][19]) and Maddy (born 2004).

   His father [150]Michael Balls is a former academic and European civil
   servant, an expert in alternatives to the use of animals in experiments
   and chairman of the [151]Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical
   Experiments (FRAME).

   He is a keen supporter of [152]Norwich City FC, regularly attending
   games at [153]Carrow Road where he sits in the Upper tier of the
   Barclay Stand.^[[154]citation needed]
