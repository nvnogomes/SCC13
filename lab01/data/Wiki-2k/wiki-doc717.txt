Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)
   is a non-[8]GAAP metric that can be used to evaluate a company's
   profitability.

                EBITDA = Operating Revenue Operating Expenses + Other
                Revenue

   Its name comes from the fact that Operating Expenses do not include
   interest, taxes, or [9]amortization. EBITDA is not a defined measure
   according to [10]Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and
   thus can be calculated however a company wishes. It is also not a
   measure of [11]cash flow.

   EBITDA differs from the operating cash flow in a [12]cash flow
   statement primarily by excluding payments for taxes or interest as well
   as changes in [13]working capital. EBITDA also differs from [14]free
   cash flow because it excludes cash requirements for replacing capital
   assets ([15]capex). EBITDA is used when evaluating a company's ability
   to earn a profit, and it is often used in stock analysis.

[[21]edit] Use by debtholders

   EBITDA measures the cash earnings that may be applied to interest and
   debt retirement. Debt holders ignore depreciation and amortization
   because they are non-cash charges and thus do not interfere with a
   company's ability to repay debt. Additionally, such figures are merely
   a reconciliation of cash-basis accounting to accrual-basis accounting
   and are subject to a certain degree of flexibility corporate
   accountants have when setting depreciation and amortization schedules.

   In practice, capital expenditures and the maintenance of assets may use
   up cash available for debt repayment, and so will increase risk of
   default. The risk may be mitigated by incorporating loan [22]covenants
   restricting the borrower's ability to make certain expenditures or
   investments under certain conditions.

   There are two EBITDA metrics used.
    1. The interest coverage ratio is used to determine a firm's ability
       to pay interest on outstanding debt. It is calculated : EBITDA
       /Interest Expense. The greater the year-to-year variance in EBITDA,
       the greater the multiple should be.
    2. The measure of the pay-back period for a debt is : Debt/EBITDA. The
       longer the payback period, the greater the risk.

   The ratios can be customized by reducing Debt by any cash on the
   balance sheet or by deducting maintenance CapEx from EBITDA to form a
   measure closer to [23]free cash flow.

[[24]edit] Use by equity owners

   A company's Net Income is distorted by decisions that the company made
   in previous years. This is because of the differences between
   [25]accrual accounting and [26]cash basis accounting. Some purchases
   are depreciated or amortized over 20 years or more, with a negative
   impact on the Net Income long after the actual economic effects of the
   purchases have ceased. The EBITDA does not suffer this distortion, so
   investors can get an idea of how profitable the company really is.

   [27]Depreciation of capital expenditures is a particularly strong
   factor. For example, if a company spends $99 million in new desktop
   computers for all its employees, the company will often decide to
   depreciate the purchase over their expected lifetime of three years.
   This way, in the first year, when the company calculates its "income"
   number, it shows only $33 million in expenditure that year on desktop
   computers. The company's income number excludes money actually spent,
   but that will be "used" in future years. In each of the second and
   third years, the company also shows $33 million in expenditures per
   year on desktop computers. During this latter period, the cash
   expenditures have already been made, but a portion of that spending is
   allocated to these later periods.

   [28]Capital expenditures typically vary from year to year. Accrual
   accounting accounts for this by spreading the expense of capital
   investments over the years in which they will be generating value for
   the company. EBITDA strips out the effect of irregular capital
   expenditures. Investors can use EBITDA to approximate the fundamental
   earning power of the company's operations while separately factoring in
   the projected capital expenditures needed to maintain those operations.
   This is valuable because of the [29]time value of money principle. (An
   expenditure is less costly if it is to be made several years into the
   future, because during the interim period the firm can use the cash for
   that expenditure to generate income in other ways. This is true as long
   as inflation is ignored. Oftentimes a capital expenditure today will
   cost much less than the same required expenditure at some point in the
   future simply because of inflation.)

   Because EBITDA is measured before interest (which vary with the amount
   of debt financing), it approximates the company's earnings potential as
   if financed with zero debt. It corrects for the differences between
   companies' valuations due to their capital structure.

   [30]Warren Buffett famously asked, "Does management think the tooth
   fairy pays for [31]capital expenditures?" For many companies, capital
   expenditures (for example) may be required at a consistent level;
   excluding the associated accounting allocation may overstate the
   company's profitability. Similarly, amortization (goodwill is no longer
   amortized since the 2002 change; it is now tested for impairment each
   year) may reflect important changes in the company's business
   prospects.

   The same argument applies to the purchase of long-life capital assets.
   Depreciation may be interpreted as:
    1. the allocation of the original cost, at a later date, when the
       asset was used to generate revenue. The time-value-of-money (same
       argument used above) means that depreciation may understate the
       cost.
    2. the amount of cash required to be retained in order to finance the
       eventual replacement asset. Since inflation is the basis for
       time-value-of-money, the amounts set aside today must be invested
       and grow in value in order to pay the inflated price in the future.
    3. the decrease in value of the balance sheet asset since the last
       reporting period. Assets wear out with use, and will eventually
       have to be replaced.

[[32]edit] Unprofitable businesses

   When comparing businesses with no profits, their potential to make
   profit is more important than their Net Loss. Since taxes on losses
   will be misleading in this context, taxes can be ignored. Capital
   expenditures and their related debt result in fixed costs. These are of
   less importance than the variable costs that can be expected to grow
   with increasing sales volume, in order to cover the fixed costs. So
   depreciation and interest costs are of less importance. It is likely
   that an unprofitable business is burning cash (has a negative cash
   flow), so investors are most concerned with "how long the cash will
   last before the business must get more financing" (resulting in debt or
   equity dilution).

   EBITDA is not used as a valuation metric in these circumstances. It is
   a starting point on which future growth is applied and future
   profitability discounted back to the present. Equity owners only
   benefit from net profits, after all the expenses are paid.

   During the [33]dot com bubble companies promoted their stock by
   emphasising either EBITDA or [34]pro forma earnings in their financial
   reports, and explaining away the (often poor) "income" number. This
   would involve ignoring one-time write-offs, asset impairments and other
   costs deemed to be non-recurring. Because EBITDA (and its variations)
   are not measures generally accepted under U.S. [35]GAAP, the [36]U.S.
   Securities and Exchange Commission requires that companies registering
   securities with it (and when filing its periodic reports) reconcile
   EBITDA to net income in order to avoid misleading investors.
