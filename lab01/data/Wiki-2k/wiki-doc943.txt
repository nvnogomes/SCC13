From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edward John Noble (1882 1958) was an [8]American [9]broadcasting and
   [10]candy industrialist originally from [11]Gouverneur, [12]New York.
   He co-founded the [13]Life Savers Corporation in 1913. He founded the
   [14]American Broadcasting Company when he purchased the [15]NBC Blue
   Network in 1943 following the [16]Federal Communications Commission's
   (FCC) decree that [17]RCA divest itself of one of its two radio
   networks.

   Edward Noble was born in Gouverneur, New York and educated in the
   public schools. He attended [18]Syracuse University and graduated from
   [19]Yale in 1905. He founded the Life Savers Candy Company in 1913.

   He was the first chairman of the [20]Civil Aeronautics Authority. He
   also served as Under[21]secretary of Commerce under President
   [22]Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1939-1940. in 1943, following the
   [23]Federal Communications Commission's order that RCA divest itself of
   one of its two radio networks, he founded the American Broadcasting
   Company (ABC) when he purchased the NBC Blue Network.

   In 1912, chocolate manufacturer Clarence Crane of [24]Cleveland, Ohio
   invented Life Savers as a "summer candy" that could withstand heat
   better than chocolate. Since the mints looked like miniature life
   preservers, he called them Life Savers. After registering the
   trademark, Crane sold the rights to the peppermint candy to Edward
   Noble for $2,900. Instead of using cardboard rolls, which were not very
   successful, Noble created tin-foil wrappers to keep the mints fresh.
   Pep-O-Mint was the first Life Savers flavor.

   Noble was part of the [25]St. Lawrence Seaway Project and was appointed
   to the advisory board by President [26]Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954. He
   owned Boldt Castle, the Thousand Island Club, and a summer residence on
   Wellesley Island. The ornamental street lights in the village park are
   all that remain of the gift of new street lights that were given to the
   village by Edward and his brother, Robert. The lights were in memory of
   their father.

   Edward Noble died peacefully in his sleep on [27]December 28, [28]1958.

   Three hospitals and a foundation are named after him.
