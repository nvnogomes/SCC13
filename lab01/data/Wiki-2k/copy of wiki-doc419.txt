Sleep deprived driving

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Drowsy driving)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   Sleep deprived driving is the operation of a motor vehicle while being
   cognitively impaired by a lack of [9]sleep. Sleep deprivation is a
   major cause of motor vehicle accidents, and it can impair the human
   brain as much as [10]alcohol can. According to a 1998 survey, 23% of
   adults have fallen asleep while driving.^[11][1] According to the
   United States Department of Transportation, male drivers admit to have
   fallen asleep while driving twice as much as female drivers.^[12][2]

[[21]edit] The effects of sleep deprivation on driving performance

   Sleep deprivation has been proven to affect driving ability in three
   areas:^[22][3]
    1. It impairs coordination.
    2. It causes longer reaction times.
    3. It impairs judgment.

[[23]edit] The effects of sleep deprivation compared to the effects of
alcohol

   Numerous studies have found that sleep deprivation can affect driving
   as much, and sometimes more, than alcohol. British researchers have
   found that driving after 17 to 18 hours of being awake is as harmful as
   driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.05%, the legal limit in many
   European countries.^[24][3] Men under 30 are more likely to be in an
   accident caused by sleep deprivation. ^[25][4]

[[26]edit] Accidents

   It has been estimated that between 16% and 60% of all accidents have
   sleep deprivation as a cause.^[27][3] Between 1989 and 1993, it has
   been estimated that an average of 1544 people were killed annually in
   the US as a result of sleep deprived driving.^[28][1]. Accidents
   related to sleep deprivation are most likely to happen in the early to
   midafternoon, and in the very early morning hours.^[29][5] Sleep
   deprivation was blamed a major cause of the [30]Selby rail crash in
   which 10 people died and 82 were injured.

[[31]edit] Sleep deprived driving in truckers and in the military

   Sleep deprived driving is a major problem in truckers and in the
   military. The US military estimates that approximately 9% of crashes
   resulting in death or serious injury during [32]Operation Desert Storm
   and [33]Operation Desert Shield were caused by sleep deprived
   driving.^[34][1]

[[35]edit] Government response to sleep deprived driving

   Governments had attempted to reduce sleep deprived driving through
   education messages and by ingraining roads with dents, known as
   "rumble" strips in the US, which cause a noise when drivers wander out
   of their lane. The [36]Government of Western Australia recently
   introduced a "Driver Reviver" program where drivers can receive free
   coffee to help them stay awake.
