   Europa Barbarorum (or EB) ([24]Latin: [25]Europe of the [26]Barbarians)
   is a [27]modification (or "mod") of the [28]personal computer game
   [29]Rome: Total War (RTW) based on the desire to provide Rome: Total
   War players with a more historically accurate game
   experience.^[30][3]^[31][4] Similar to the original game, the player
   controls an empire with the goal of conquering as much territory as
   possible and eliminating rival factions, which are controlled by the
   computer, or [32]AI.

   The basic gameplay mechanics of the original game remain the same. The
   main campaign is split between two gameplay modes: a [33]turn-based
   strategy map for moving whole armies and managing the empire; and a
   [34]real-time battle map for fighting battles on the ground between two
   armies. The two game modes are linked, with success or failure in one
   game mode influencing the chances of success or failure in the other.

   Europa Barbarorum is a [35]total conversion modification as it replaces
   all the aspects of the original Rome: Total War game that can be
   replaced, such as unit models, statistics and the musical
   score.^[36][5]^[37][6] It covers the period from 272 BC to 14 AD (a
   period only slightly different to the original game's timespan of 270
   BC to 14 AD),^[38][7] and introduces a four-turn-per-year system on the
   campaign map (as opposed to the two-turn-per-year system of Rome: Total
   War) to better represent the flow of history.

[[57]edit] Development history

[[58]edit] Concept

   The Europa Barbarorum project began in January 2004, eight months
   before Rome: Total War's release,^[59][8] when the Europa Barbarorum
   development team who were following the game's development became
   concerned that its "[60]barbarian" factions such as the [61]Gauls and
   [62]Germanic tribes were being portrayed in a historically inaccurate
   manner as stereotypical hordes of unwashed savages.^[63][9] The Europa
   Barbarorum team felt that such representations conformed more to a
   sensationalist [64]Hollywood stereotype than to historical fact,
   maintaining that ancient "barbarian" cultures are often judged and
   possibly misunderstood based on an [65]interpretatio romana or
   [66]interpretatio graeca due to the nature of ancient historiographical
   conventions.^[67][3] The true nature of these civilizations, says the
   Europa Barbarorum team, is better revealed through [68]archaeological
   evidence and what remains of their own ancient texts.

   The developers of Europa Barbarorum tried to convince the [69]Creative
   Assembly (CA), the [70]developers of Rome: Total War, to alter their
   depiction of the period to make the whole game more historically
   accurate.^[71][3] Whilst some suggestions were taken on board and
   adopted in the final release of Rome: Total War, most were disregarded
   by the Creative Assembly due to publisher pressures and financial
   expediency. Some Europa Barbarorum members continued to offer their
   services as historical advisors but due to inherent concerns over
   [72]intellectual property rights, the Creative Assembly declined the
   offer.

[[73]edit] Development

   Having exhausted this avenue for change, the Europa Barbarorum members
   then resolved to modify the game themselves upon its release. Once
   Rome: Total War was released, the Europa Barbarorum development team
   immediately began work on the modification, recruiting a large team of
   volunteer [74]skinners, [75]modellers, [76]coders, and [77]historians
   to have the modification better reflect historical reality and
   subsequently commenced research and preliminary work for the
   modification.

   After leaving its [78]alpha phase, Europa Barbarorum was released as a
   public open [79]beta, with the first such release being version 0.7.2
   which was developed for patch 1.2 of Rome: Total War,^[80][10] and
   released on 27 December 2005.^[81][1] After three more minor releases
   in March 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments in the
   modification,^[82][11]^[83][12]^[84][13] the next major release of
   Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 on 6 December 2006.^[85][14] The
   release marked the start of the 0.8.x series of releases, and was the
   first Europa Barbarorum release for patch 1.5 of Rome: Total
   War.^[86][15]^[87][10] It included the addition of the [88]Sabaean
   faction, new music, the addition of the provisional military government
   level, the inclusion of a new MIC system and other changes.^[89][16]
   The release of version 0.8 was also announced by the Europa Barbarorum
   development team on a third-party computer modification review
   website.^[90][17] There subsequently followed three more minor 0.8.x
   releases during the first half of 2007, all of which primarily made
   minor adjustments to the modification and fixed bugs.^[91][18]^[92][19]
   In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80-0.81 versions were
   tracked.^[93][20]^[94][21]

[[95]edit] Release and further versions

   The next major release was version 1.0, which was released on October
   12, 2007 and included new government options for the [96]Pahlava and
   [97]Hayasdan factions, the addition of a new type of wall to the
   battlemap, new units, new music from [98]Prehistoric Music Ireland, a
   more challenging start to campaigns for the player and other
   changes.^[99][22] The 1.0 version was downloaded over 90,000 times in
   the six months following its release.^[100][20]^[101][21]

   The current release is version 1.1, which was released on April 7, 2008
   and included new battle map landscapes,^[102][23]^[103][24] new units,
   the addition of the [104]Pahlavi voicemod and the inclusion of an
   introduction video for the [105]Saka Rauka faction.^[106][23] The next
   release being worked on, version 1.2, is expected to contain the
   addition of the [107]Punic voicemod^[108][25] and bug fixes; the
   development team had previously stated that future releases of Europa
   Barbarorum for the Rome: Total War engine will not include any major
   gameplay changes.

   The Europa Barbarorum development team is also developing a new version
   of the modification for the [109]Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms
   engine^[110][26] which will be named Europa Barbarorum II. Europa
   Barbarorum II is scheduled to include many changes and new features,
   such as new government and recruitment systems, an improved trait and
   ancillary system,^[111][21] faction migrations, horde
   factions,^[112][27] limits on elite units, free unit upkeep for some
   garrisoned units,^[113][28] a larger campaign map, ten new playable
   factions^[114][29] including the [115]Kingdom of Pergamon,^[116][30] a
   new system of province integration and new units of better graphical
   quality than those of Europa Barbarorum I,^[117][26]^[118][31] with
   greater variation among units.^[119][21]

   The modification has been included with [120]demos and other
   modifications in the [121]PC Format and [122]PC Gamer (UK)^[123][5]
   [124]computer magazines published in the [125]United Kingdom and
   [126]South Africa.

[[127]edit] Features

   Even though Europa Barbarorum is set in a similar time period and
   geographical area to the original Rome: Total War game, it is a
   [128]total conversion which offers a very different gaming experience.
   All units, buildings, map features and other moddable parameters of the
   game have been reworked from scratch. New features not present in the
   original game have also been added.^[129][32]

[[130]edit] Units

   Screenshots of battles from Rome: Total War (top) and Europa Barbarorum
   (bottom)

   One of the areas in which the greatest amount of change can be seen is
   that of the units present in the game. Reviewers have commented that
   the differences between Europa Barbarorum and its parent game are
   "immediate" and "striking" and that the modification is different to
   its parent game "in look and in play".^[131][5] The same review also
   noted that all the units that were present in Rome: Total War have been
   removed and replaced in Europa Barbarorum.^[132][5] Specific examples
   include the removal of several units that the Europa Barbarorum team
   considered to be historically doubtful or only marginally used in
   warfare, such as [133]Arcani, [134]incendiary pigs and [135]camels, as
   well as the "[136]Oliphaunt" [137]Easter egg unit from the original
   Rome: Total War.^[138][23] A new unit recruitment system based on
   governments and assimilation, and set up by the player on a
   region-by-region basis, has been introduced.^[139][32]

[[140]edit] Faction changes

   Europa Barbarorum includes several factions not present in the original
   game. The overall theme to the changes in factions has been one of
   increasing historical accuracy,^[141][3] with the more
   familiar-sounding, Western faction names of the original game^[142][33]
   being replaced by factions' own names for themselves.^[143][33]
   Examples of such name changes include the renaming the original game's
   [144]Armenia faction, [145]Hayasdan and renaming the [146]Germania
   faction, [147]Sweboz.^[148][33]

   Many of the changes to factions introduced have had a greater impact on
   gameplay than renaming factions. For example, the original game's
   [149]Gaul faction has been replaced with two new factions: the
   [150]Aedui and the [151]Arverni. The [152]Scythia faction has been
   replaced by the [153]Sauromatae, and the Greek Cities faction has been
   replaced by the Koinon Hellenon ([154]Ancient Greek: League of the
   Greeks), a faction which represents the [155]Chremonidean League of
   [156]Athens, [157]Sparta and [158]Rhodes. Entirely new factions include
   [159]Baktria, a [160]Central Asian [161]Hellenic empire, [162]Epeiros,
   an empire famous for producing [163]Pyrrhos of Epiros, [164]Saka-Rauka,
   a heavily [165]cavalry-based faction based in [166]Central Asia and
   [167]Saba, the [168]pre-Islamic kingdom in [169]Arabia.

   Despite initial speculation that Europa Barbarorum would contain four
   playable Roman factions like the original Rome: Total War,^[170][4] the
   original [171]SPQR, [172]Brutii, [173]Julii and [174]Scipii
   factions^[175][34] have all been merged into one faction, the
   [176]Romani,^[177][35] again out of interests of historical accuracy.
   Although early releases of Europa Barbarorum included the [178]Yuezhi
   as a playable faction, it was later dropped as the Yuezhi people had
   not yet migrated to the area of the world depicted on the Europa
   Barbarorum campaign map by 272 BC.^[179][36] They have since been
   recreated through scripted events in the modification, but have never
   re-appeared as a fully playable faction in the modification since their
   initial removal.^[180][33]

   As well as replacing existing and adding new factions to the game,
   Europa Barbarorum has also made changes to those factions from the
   original Rome: Total War that it has not replaced entirely. These
   changes include creating a new unit roster for the Egyptian faction in
   the game (named [181]Egypt in the original Rome: Total War^[182][34]
   and the [183]Ptolemaioi in Europa Barbarorum^[184][33]), a faction
   which the Europa Barbarorum team felt was previously ahistorical,
   calling Rome: Total War's Egyptian soldiers "[185]Mummy Returns
   Egyptians",^[186][32]^[187][5] to correspond to the [188]Ptolemaic
   period of history. The Europa Barbarorum team has also given
   [189]Nomadic, [190]desert, and [191]steppe cultures their own
   government buildings,^[192][36]^[193][37] which some say has helped
   differentiate between Europa Barbarorum's factions and make the
   differences between Europa Barbarorum and the original Rome: Total War
   more than just cosmetic.^[194][5] Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum
   featured player alerts representing the major stages of the breakup of
   the [195]Seleukid faction, if that collapse occurred in the
   game,^[196][32] but such features became impossible to implement after
   the removal of the [197]SPQR faction of the original game, which had
   been used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, but was then
   replaced by the [198]Saba faction.^[199][16] On the other hand, as well
   as adding new factions, Europa Barbarorum has dropped entirely the
   [200]Numidia faction of the original Rome: Total War.

   Other faction-related changes in Europa Barbarorum have concerned not
   just one, but many in-game factions. Such changes include the addition
   of new, historically accurate family trees for all factions, as well as
   the inclusion of historically accurate diplomatic relationships between
   the game's factions at the start of the main campaign in 272 BC,
   including representing existing treaties between different states
   through scripting,^[201][32] and a revised "[202]Fog-of-war" to show
   more realistically each faction's understanding of the world in 272
   BC.^[203][32]^[204][5]^[205][38] In addition, rebel forces have been
   given ethnic names and strengths, more than 4,900 new names for
   generals and family members of [206]Hellenic factions, transliterated
   from [207]Ancient Greek, have been added to the game, and new victory
   conditions have been implemented for every faction. As well as this,
   the Europa Barbarorum team has introduced faction-specific player
   alerts for when the player captures a building important to their
   faction.^[208][32]

[[209]edit] Cartography

   The Europa Barbarorum world map, correct for version 1.1

   Europa Barbarorum features a campaign map altered from that of Rome:
   Total War in several ways. Its eastern and southern regions have been
   expanded, with [210]Arabia, [211]India, [212]Central Asia, and the
   [213]Upper Nile region receiving new territories, and provinces have
   been given accurate names in the language of their controlling peoples
   at the game's start.^[214][32] Relief, province boundaries, snow
   boundaries, vegetation types, coastlines and areas prone to natural
   disaster^[215][38] in 272 BC have all been researched and implemented
   into the campaign map.^[216][39] The [217]Nile-Red Sea canal linking
   the [218]Indian Ocean and [219]Mediterranean Sea has been added to the
   campaign map, as have the great trade routes of the ancient world, such
   as the [220]Amber and [221]Silk Roads, which can be captured and
   exploited.^[222][32] Europa Barbarorum also includes new campaign
   map^[223][38] and battle map^[224][23] tree models, resulting in denser
   forests in both [225]gameplay modes. Special buildings in provinces at
   the edges of the campaign map representing trade routes with provinces
   outside the campaign map have also been added.^[226][38]

[[227]edit] Traits

   The original [228]trait system present in Rome: Total War has been
   expanded upon by Europa Barbarorum. The trait system in Europa
   Barbarorum is based on a combination of upbringing, ageing, relatives'
   traits, and health, factors which affect trait acquisition and
   development over a character's life. Europa Barbarorum contains both
   more traits overall, and more faction-specific traits, than Rome: Total
   War.^[229][32] Each adult male character in Europa Barbarorum receives,
   upon "coming of age" at sixteen, six primary traits: Intelligence,
   Charisma, Vitality, Selflessness, Temperament and Loyalty. These traits
   determine the personality of a character and can also influence which
   other traits they will acquire in future and which tasks they will
   perform well at and poorly at.^[230][40]

   In addition to the six primary traits, there are also traits which can
   only be acquired by characters from a certain faction or of a certain
   ethnicity. The trait system for Hellenic characters, for instance, is
   based on [231]Theophrastos' [232]Characters and [233]Aristotle's
   teachings on the [234]Golden Mean. In a similar fashion, the Roman
   trait system in Europa Barbarorum is partially based on the moral tales
   of [235]Valerius Maximus.^[236][32] Traits related to special events,
   such as the [237]Olympics which a Hellenic character can compete in and
   possibly even win an event in something which would lead to the
   acquisition of more positive traits or a [238]Triumph held in Rome to
   celebrate a Roman General's victory against a specific faction which
   can increase their [239]influence.^[240][32] Hellenic characters can
   also complete training in the [241]Spartan [242]Agoge, which can earn
   them traits of various levels of utility, depending on their
   performance during their training.^[243][41] The personalities and
   traits of all starting generals in the game have been made to mirror
   those of their historical counterparts.^[244][32]

[[245]edit] Buildings

   A diagram of the possible development of the governments of nomadic
   factions in Europa Barbarorum

   Europa Barbarorum adds a number of new building types to the [246]turn-
   and campaign map-based part of the game.

   The game's core buildings, usually referred to as "government
   buildings",^[247][42] represent different ways of ruling a
   newly-conquered province. In decreasing order of cost required to
   install them in the game, the four government types available in Europa
   Barbarorum are: a homeland government, a government of a colonised
   province, a subject state government, and an allied state
   government.^[248][42] The four different government types carry with
   them different bonuses and penalties, and the greater the autonomy
   allowed, the greater the shift in focus for the ruling faction from
   their own factional buildings and units to the construction of native
   buildings and recruitment of native units.^[249][43] Allied state
   governmets have been further differentiated in later releases of Europa
   Barbarorum through the introduction of the "client ruler script", which
   automaticaly installs a [250]puppet ruler in such a province, further
   limiting the player's direct control over it.

   Europa Barbarorum replaces separate facilities for training different
   troop types with an all-encompassing line of [251]military-industrial
   complex ("MIC") buildings, which are responsible for the recruitment of
   virtually all troop types in the game.^[252][44]^[253][42] There are
   two different, independent complex systems in Europa Barbarorum: a
   "factional MIC", for recruiting the faction's own troops, and a "local
   MIC", for recruiting troops native to the province the complex has been
   built in. How far the two types of complexes can be upgraded is
   dependant on the government of the province: those with greater
   autonomy can upgrade the local complex further while expansion of the
   factional military-industrial complex is limited, and vice
   versa.^[254][15]^[255][43]

   Europa Barbarorum also introduces a number of unique buildings
   representing both man-made objects of wonder and features of the
   landscape. The former can be destroyed by the player for a monetary
   pay-off, but then cannot be rebuilt and the province in which they
   stood loses the bonuses they provided;^[256][45] the latter type of
   unique building is indestructible.^[257][32]

   Other new building types include shrines, clinics, granaries, theatres
   and [258]stupas. The modification also features new temple systems
   which represent the most popular temple types of each of the depicted
   factions. The temples provide historically accurate bonuses and also
   come with their own descriptions and images on the campaign
   map.^[259][32]^[260][43]

[[261]edit] Non-Unit Graphics

   As well as adding new units to the game, the Europa Barbarorum team has
   also included new non-unit graphics in the modification, such as
   faction-specific graphics for the faction selection menu, a new
   campaign minimap, faction icons, faction selection buttons,
   faction-defeated graphics, advisor images, campaign map standards, and
   battle map banners.^[262][32] Europa Barbarorum also includes new
   campaign map siege, ship, unit, general, watchtower, and resource
   graphics^[263][9]^[264][46]^[265][39]^[266][38]^[267][32] in addition
   to its new battle map graphics.^[268][24]

[[269]edit] Game Mechanics

   Europa Barbarorum's mechanics differ noticeably in several ways from
   Rome: Total War's. One of the most obvious differences is the fact that
   in the original Rome: Total War campaign, one year passed after every
   two turns on the campaign map; in Europa Barbarorum, one year passes
   after every four turns, meaning that turns represent seasons in Europa
   Barbarorum indeed, they have been renamed as such^[270][23] with
   characters facing restrictions on how far they can move during
   winter.^[271][32] In addition, the Europa Barbarorum team has designed
   new custom battle formations in order to encourage more realistic
   behaviour from the AI and has also added new battle map unit
   animations, such as those of two-handed lancers and horse
   archers.^[272][32]

[[273]edit] Audio

   Europa Barbarorum features its own soundtrack and does not include any
   songs from the original Rome: Total War soundtrack. Europa Barbarorum's
   music comes from a number of sources. Some of the tracks were composed
   by [274]Morgan Casey and [275]Nick
   Wylie.^[276][32]^[277][47]^[278][48]^[279][49] More recently, authentic
   music for the Celtic factions and reconstructed and recreated Roman
   music, created by [280]Prehistoric Music Ireland^[281][50]^[282][32]
   and the German group Musica Romana^[283][51] have been added. Europa
   Barbarorum also includes its own "voicemod", an attempt by the
   developers to replace the English cries of Rome: Total War's soldiers
   with ones in their native languages. To date, voice recordings in
   [284]classical Latin, [285]Celtic, [286]ancient
   Greek^[287][32]^[288][52] and [289]Pahlavi^[290][53] have been added,
   and recordings in other ancient languages, such as [291]Punic, are also
   being worked on.^[292][53]^[293][25]

[[294]edit] Reception

   Europa Barbarorum has had some impact both on the [295]Total War gaming
   community and on the wider games industry.

[[296]edit] Awards and reviews

   Europa Barbarorum has won numerous community awards, including
   [297]TWCenter.net Best Rome: Total War Era Modification 2006, Best
   Modding Team 2006, Best Gameplay and Aesthetics 2006,^[298][54]

   Europa Barbarorum was featured and reviewed in a number of [302]video
   game magazines. It has been reviewed in [303]PC Gamer (UK) twice, in
   March 2005 and February 2008.^[304][5] The 2008 review was
   overwhelmingly positive, saying that "EB feels like a whole new Total
   War game", and going on to praise the modification's "stunning" scope
   and the "striking" extent of the differences between it and Rome: Total
   War. The review was somewhat critical of the modification's graphical
   user interfaces which "[occasionally]" had a "home-made" feel to them,
   as well as its lack of accessibility and steep learning curve, although
   it adds that the second point is not a large problem as the
   modification is largely a "master's challenge for accomplished Rome
   players". The review finished on a positive note, summing Europa
   Barbarorum up as a "superior game".^[305][5]

   Other magazines which have reviewed Europa Barbarorum include the
   Italian PC Gaming magazine [306]Giochi per il mio computer, which
   reviewed the modification in April 2005; the French PC Gaming magazine
   [307]Canard PC in 2005, the Romanian PC Gaming magazine [308]LeveL in
   2006, the German magazine [309]GameStar in April 2007 and the
   Portuguese magazine [310]BGamer in December 2007.

   Europa Barbarorum has also received several online
   reviews.^[311][4]^[312][21] The modification received a review early
   into its development process on [313]HeavenGames.com, which said that
   it was an "ambitious" project and praised its commitment to historical
   accuracy, even stating that the Europa Barbarorum development team was
   going to use satellite imagery and climate change statistics to
   accurately portray the world as it was in 272 BC.^[314][4] More
   recently, the modification has been reviewed on [315]BoomTown.net,
   which praised the modification's "incredibly well-researched and
   -devised" unit stats system, as well as its "legion of
   historians".^[316][21]

   There are a number of fan-made sub-modifications for Europa Barbarorum
   of varying scope which modify different aspects of the game by editing
   the associated [318]text files. Europa Barbarorum has also been
   [319]ported to run using the [320]Rome: Total War: Barbarian Invasion
   or [321]Rome: Total War: Alexander [322]executable.^[323][56]^[324][57]
   Playing the modification on the new platforms has been reported to have
   made the campaign AI utilise more complex
   strategies.^[325][56]^[326][57]
