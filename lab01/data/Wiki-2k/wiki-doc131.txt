   The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system for
   computers, services, or any resource participating in the [73]Internet.
   It associates various information with [74]domain names assigned to
   such participants. Most importantly, it translates domain names
   meaningful to humans into the numerical (binary) identifiers associated
   with networking equipment for the purpose of locating and addressing
   these devices world-wide. An often used analogy to explain the Domain
   Name System is that it serves as the "[75]phone book" for the Internet
   by translating human-friendly computer [76]hostnames into [77]IP
   addresses. For example, [78]www.example.com translates to
   208.77.188.166.

   The Domain Name System makes it possible to assign [79]domain names to
   groups of Internet users in a meaningful way, independent of each
   user's physical location. Because of this, [80]World-Wide Web (WWW)
   [81]hyperlinks and Internet contact information can remain consistent
   and constant even if the current Internet routing arrangements change
   or the participant uses a mobile device. Internet domain names are
   easier to remember than IP addresses such as 208.77.188.166 ([82]IPv4)
   or 2001:db8:1f70::999:de8:7648:6e8 ([83]IPv6). People take advantage of
   this when they recite meaningful [84]URLs and [85]e-mail addresses
   without having to know how the machine will actually locate them.

   The Domain Name System distributes the responsibility of assigning
   domain names and mapping those names to IP addresses by designating
   [86]authoritative name servers for each domain. Authoritative name
   servers are assigned to be responsible for their particular domains,
   and in turn can assign other authoritative name servers for their
   sub-domains. This mechanism has made the DNS distributed, fault
   tolerant, and helped avoid the need for a single central register to be
   continually consulted and updated.

   In general, the Domain Name System also stores other types of
   information, such as the list of [87]mail servers that accept [88]email
   for a given Internet domain. By providing a world-wide, distributed
   [89]keyword-based redirection service, the Domain Name System is an
   essential component of the functionality of the [90]Internet.

   Other identifiers such as RFID tags, UPC codes, International
   characters in email addresses and host names, and a variety of other
   identifiers could all potentially utilize DNS ^[91][1].

   The Domain Name System also defines the technical underpinnings of the
   functionality of this database service. For this purpose it defines the
   DNS [92]protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and
   communication exchanges used in DNS, as part of the [93]Internet
   Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). The context of the DNS within the Internet
   protocols may be seen in the following diagram. The DNS protocol was
   developed and defined in the early 1980s and published by the
   [94]Internet Engineering Task Force (cf. History).

[[122]edit] History

   The practice of using a name as a more human-legible abstraction of a
   machine's numerical address on the network predates even [123]TCP/IP.
   This practice dates back to the [124]ARPAnet era. Back then, a
   different system was used. The DNS was invented in 1983, shortly after
   TCP/IP was deployed. With the older system, each computer on the
   network retrieved a file called HOSTS.TXT from a computer at SRI (now
   [125]SRI International)^[126][2]^[127][3]. The HOSTS.TXT file mapped
   numerical addresses to names. A [128]hosts file still exists on most
   modern operating systems, either by default or through configuration,
   and allows users to specify an [129]IP address (eg. 208.77.188.166) to
   use for a [130]hostname (eg. [131]www.example.net) without checking
   DNS. Systems based on a hosts file have inherent limitations, because
   of the obvious requirement that every time a given computer's address
   changed, every computer that seeks to communicate with it would need an
   update to its hosts file.

   The growth of networking required a more scalable system that recorded
   a change in a host's address in one place only. Other hosts would learn
   about the change dynamically through a notification system, thus
   completing a globally accessible network of all hosts' names and their
   associated IP Addresses.

   At the request of [132]Jon Postel, [133]Paul Mockapetris invented the
   Domain Name System in 1983 and wrote the first implementation. The
   original specifications appear in [134]RFC 882 and [135]RFC 883. In
   November 1987, the publication of [136]RFC 1034 and [137]RFC 1035
   updated the DNS specification and made [138]RFC 882 and [139]RFC 883
   obsolete. Several more-recent [140]RFCs have proposed various
   extensions to the core DNS protocols.

   In 1984, four [141]Berkeley studentsDouglas Terry, Mark Painter, David
   Riggle and Songnian Zhouwrote the first [142]UNIX implementation, which
   was maintained by Ralph Campbell thereafter. In 1985, Kevin Dunlap of
   [143]DEC significantly re-wrote the DNS implementation and renamed it
   [144]BINDBerkeley Internet Name Domain. Mike Karels, Phil Almquist and
   [145]Paul Vixie have maintained BIND since then. BIND was [146]ported
   to the [147]Windows NT platform in the early 1990s.

   BIND was widely distributed, especially on Unix systems, and is the
   dominant DNS software in use on the Internet.^[148][4] With the heavy
   use and resulting scrutiny of its open-source code, as well as
   increasingly more sophisticated attack methods, many security flaws
   were discovered in BIND. This contributed to the development of a
   number of [149]alternative nameserver and resolver programs. BIND
   itself was re-written from scratch in version 9, which has a security
   record comparable to other modern Internet software.

[[150]edit] Structure

[[151]edit] The domain name space

   Domain names, arranged in a tree, cut into zones, each served by a
   nameserver.

   The domain name space consists of a [152]tree of domain names. Each
   node or leaf in the tree has zero or more resource records, which hold
   information associated with the domain name. The tree sub-divides into
   zones beginning at the [153]root zone. A [154]DNS zone consists of a
   collection of connected nodes authoritatively served by an
   authoritative nameserver. (Note that a single nameserver can host
   several zones.)

   Administrative responsibility over any zone may be divided, thereby
   creating additional zones. Authority is said to be delegated for a
   portion of the old space, usually in form of sub-domains, to another
   nameserver and administrative entity. The old zone ceases to be
   authoritative for the new zone.

[[155]edit] Parts of a domain name

   A [156]domain name usually consists of two or more parts (technically
   labels), which are conventionally written separated by dots, such as
   example.com.
     * The rightmost label conveys the [157]top-level domain (for example,
       the address www.example.com has the top-level domain com).
     * Each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or [158]subdomain
       of the domain above it. Note: subdomain expresses relative
       dependence, not absolute dependence. For example: example.com is a
       subdomain of the com domain, and www.example.com is a subdomain of
       the domain example.com. In theory, this subdivision can go down 127
       levels. Each label can contain up to 63 [159]octets. The whole
       domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 octets. ^[160][5]
       In practice, some [161]domain registries may have shorter limits.
     * A [162]hostname refers to a domain name that has one or more
       associated IP addresses; ie: the 'www.example.com' and
       'example.com' domains are both hostnames, however, the 'com' domain
       is not.

[[163]edit] DNS servers

          Main article: [164]Name server

   The Domain Name System is maintained by a distributed database system,
   which uses the [165]client-server model. The nodes of this database are
   the name servers. Each domain or subdomain has one or more
   authoritative DNS servers that publish information about that domain
   and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it. The top of the
   hierarchy is served by the [166]root nameservers: the servers to query
   when looking up (resolving) a top-level domain name ([167]TLD).

[[168]edit] DNS resolvers

          See also: [169]resolv.conf

   The client-side of the DNS is called a DNS resolver. It is responsible
   for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a
   full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g., translation
   of a domain name into an IP address.

   A DNS query may be either a recursive query or a non-recursive query:
     * A non-recursive query is one in which the DNS server may provide a
       partial answer to the query (or give an error).
     * A recursive query is one where the DNS server will fully answer the
       query (or give an error). DNS servers are not required to support
       recursive queries.

   The resolver (or another DNS server acting recursively on behalf of the
   resolver) negotiates use of recursive service using bits in the query
   headers.

   Resolving usually entails iterating through several name servers to
   find the needed information. However, some resolvers function
   simplistically and can communicate only with a single name server.
   These simple resolvers rely on a recursive query to a recursive name
   server to perform the work of finding information for them.

[[170]edit] Address resolution mechanism

          (This description deliberately uses the fictional [171].example
          TLD in accordance with the DNS guidelines.)

   In theory a full host name may have several name segments, (e.g
   ahost.ofasubnet.ofabiggernet.inadomain.example). In practice, full host
   names will frequently consist of just three segments
   (ahost.inadomain.example, and most often www.inadomain.example). For
   querying purposes, software interprets the name segment by segment,
   from right to left, using an iterative search procedure. At each step
   along the way, the program queries a corresponding DNS server to
   provide a pointer to the next server which it should consult.
   A DNS recursor consults three nameservers to resolve the address
   www.wikipedia.org.

   As originally envisaged, the process was as simple as:
    1. the local system is pre-configured with the known addresses of the
       [172]root servers in a file of root hints, which need to be updated
       periodically by the local administrator from a reliable source to
       be kept up to date with the changes which occur over time.
    2. query one of the root servers to find the server authoritative for
       the next level down (so in the case of our simple hostname, a root
       server would be asked for the address of a server with detailed
       knowledge of the example top level domain).
    3. querying this second server for the address of a DNS server with
       detailed knowledge of the second-level domain (inadomain.example in
       our example).
    4. repeating the previous step to progress down the name, until the
       final step which would, rather than generating the address of the
       next DNS server, return the final address sought.

   The diagram illustrates this process for the real host
   www.wikipedia.org.

   The mechanism in this simple form has a difficulty: it places a huge
   operating burden on the root servers, with every search for an address
   starting by querying one of them. Being as critical as they are to the
   overall function of the system, such heavy use would create an
   insurmountable bottleneck for trillions of queries placed every day. In
   practice [173]caching is used to overcome this problem, and in actual
   fact root nameservers deal with very little of the total traffic.

[[174]edit] Circular dependencies and glue records

   Name servers in delegations appear listed by name, rather than by IP
   address. This means that a resolving name server must issue another DNS
   request to find out the IP address of the server to which it has been
   referred. Since this can introduce a [175]circular dependency if the
   nameserver referred to is under the domain that it is authoritative of,
   it is occasionally necessary for the nameserver providing the
   delegation to also provide the IP address of the next nameserver. This
   record is called a glue record.

   For example, assume that the sub-domain en.wikipedia.org contains
   further sub-domains (such as something.en.wikipedia.org) and that the
   [176]authoritative name server for these lives at
   ns1.something.en.wikipedia.org. A computer trying to resolve
   something.en.wikipedia.org will thus first have to resolve
   ns1.something.en.wikipedia.org. Since ns1 is also under the
   something.en.wikipedia.org subdomain, resolving
   ns1.something.en.wikipedia.org requires resolving
   something.en.wikipedia.org which is exactly the circular dependency
   mentioned above. The dependency is broken by the glue record in the
   nameserver of en.wikipedia.org that provides the IP address of
   ns1.something.en.wikipedia.org directly to the requestor, enabling it
   to [177]bootstrap the process by figuring out where
   ns1.something.en.wikipedia.org is located.

[[178]edit] Wildcard DNS records

          Main article: [179]Wildcard DNS record

   DNS also supports wildcard DNS records that will match requests for
   non-existent domain names. A wildcard DNS record is specified by using
   a "*" as the left most label (part) of a domain name, e.g.
   *.example.com. The exact rules for when a wild card will match are
   specified in [180]RFC 1034, but the rules are neither intuitive nor
   clearly specified. This has resulted in incompatible implementations
   and unexpected results when they are used.

[[181]edit] In practice

   When an application (such as a [182]web browser) tries to find the IP
   address of a domain name, it doesn't necessarily follow all of the
   steps outlined in the Theory section above. We will first look at the
   concept of caching, and then outline the operation of DNS in "the real
   world."

[[183]edit] Caching and time to live

   Because of the huge volume of requests generated by a system like DNS,
   the designers wished to provide a mechanism to reduce the load on
   individual DNS servers. To this end, the DNS resolution process allows
   for caching (i.e. the local recording and subsequent consultation of
   the results of a DNS query) for a given period of time after a
   successful answer. How long a resolver caches a DNS response (i.e. how
   long a DNS response remains valid) is determined by a value called the
   [184]time to live (TTL). The TTL is set by the administrator of the DNS
   server handing out the response. The period of validity may vary from
   just seconds to days or even weeks.

[[185]edit] Caching time

   As a noteworthy consequence of this distributed and caching
   architecture, changes to DNS do not always take effect immediately and
   globally. This is best explained with an example: If an administrator
   has set a [186]TTL of 6 hours for the host www.wikipedia.org, and then
   changes the IP address to which www.wikipedia.org resolves at 12:01pm,
   the administrator must consider that a person who cached a response
   with the old IP address at 12:00noon will not consult the DNS server
   again until 6:00pm. The period between 12:01pm and 6:00pm in this
   example is called caching time, which is best defined as a period of
   time that begins when you make a change to a DNS record and ends after
   the maximum amount of time specified by the [187]TTL expires. This
   essentially leads to an important logistical consideration when making
   changes to DNS: not everyone is necessarily seeing the same thing
   you're seeing. [188]RFC 1912 helps to convey basic rules for how to set
   the TTL.

   Note that the term "propagation", although very widely used in this
   context, does not describe the effects of caching well. Specifically,
   it implies that [1] when you make a DNS change, it somehow spreads to
   all other DNS servers (instead, other DNS servers check in with yours
   as needed), and [2] that you do not have control over the amount of
   time the record is cached (you control the TTL values for all DNS
   records in your domain, except your NS records and any authoritative
   DNS servers that use your domain name).

   Some resolvers may override TTL values, as the protocol supports
   caching for up to 68 years or no caching at all. Negative caching (the
   non-existence of records) is determined by name servers authoritative
   for a zone which MUST include the Start of Authority (SOA) record when
   reporting no data of the requested type exists. The MINIMUM field of
   the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself is used to establish the
   TTL for the negative answer. [189]RFC 2308

   Many people incorrectly refer to a mysterious 48 hour or 72 hour
   propagation time when you make a DNS change. When one changes the NS
   records for one's domain or the IP addresses for hostnames of
   authoritative DNS servers using one's domain (if any), there can be a
   lengthy period of time before all DNS servers use the new information.
   This is because those records are handled by the zone parent DNS
   servers (for example, the .com DNS servers if your domain is
   example.com), which typically cache those records for 48 hours.
   However, those DNS changes will be immediately available for any DNS
   servers that do not have them cached. And any DNS changes on your
   domain other than the NS records and authoritative DNS server names can
   be nearly instantaneous, if you choose for them to be (by lowering the
   TTL once or twice ahead of time, and waiting until the old TTL expires
   before making the change).

[[190]edit] In the real world

   DNS resolving from program to OS-resolver to ISP-resolver to greater
   system.

   Users generally do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver.
   Instead DNS-resolution takes place transparently in client-applications
   such as [191]web-browsers, [192]mail-clients, and other Internet
   applications. When an application makes a request which requires a DNS
   lookup, such programs send a resolution request to the local [193]DNS
   resolver in the local operating system, which in turn handles the
   communications required.

   The DNS resolver will almost invariably have a cache (see above)
   containing recent lookups. If the cache can provide the answer to the
   request, the resolver will return the value in the cache to the program
   that made the request. If the cache does not contain the answer, the
   resolver will send the request to one or more designated DNS servers.
   In the case of most home users, the [194]Internet service provider to
   which the machine connects will usually supply this DNS server: such a
   user will either have configured that server's address manually or
   allowed [195]DHCP to set it; however, where systems administrators have
   configured systems to use their own DNS servers, their DNS resolvers
   point to separately maintained nameservers of the organization. In any
   event, the name server thus queried will follow the process outlined
   [196]above, until it either successfully finds a result or does not. It
   then returns its results to the DNS resolver; assuming it has found a
   result, the resolver duly caches that result for future use, and hands
   the result back to the software which initiated the request.

[[197]edit] Broken resolvers

   An additional level of complexity emerges when resolvers violate the
   rules of the DNS protocol. A number of large ISPs have configured their
   DNS servers to violate rules (presumably to allow them to run on
   less-expensive hardware than a fully-compliant resolver), such as by
   disobeying TTLs, or by indicating that a domain name does not exist
   just because one of its name servers does not respond.^[198][6]

   As a final level of complexity, some applications (such as
   web-browsers) also have their own DNS cache, in order to reduce the use
   of the DNS resolver library itself. This practice can add extra
   difficulty when debugging DNS issues, as it obscures the freshness of
   data, and/or what data comes from which cache. These caches typically
   use very short caching times on the order of one minute. [199]Internet
   Explorer offers a notable exception: recent^[200][update] versions
   cache DNS records for half an hour.^[201][7]

[[202]edit] Other applications

   The system outlined above provides a somewhat simplified scenario. The
   Domain Name System includes several other functions:
     * Hostnames and IP addresses do not necessarily match on a one-to-one
       basis. Many hostnames may correspond to a single IP address:
       combined with [203]virtual hosting, this allows a single machine to
       serve many web sites. Alternatively a single hostname may
       correspond to many IP addresses: this can facilitate [204]fault
       tolerance and load distribution, and also allows a site to move
       physical location seamlessly.
     * There are many uses of DNS besides translating names to IP
       addresses. For instance, [205]Mail transfer agents use DNS to find
       out where to deliver [206]e-mail for a particular address. The
       domain to mail exchanger mapping provided by [207]MX records
       accommodates another layer of fault tolerance and load distribution
       on top of the name to IP address mapping.

     * E-mail Blacklists: The DNS system is used for efficient storage and
       distribution of IP addresses of blacklisted e-mail hosts. The usual
       method is putting the IP address of the subject host into the
       sub-domain of a higher level domain name, and resolve that name to
       different records to indicate a positive or a negative. A
       hypothetical example using blacklist.com,
          + 102.3.4.5 is blacklisted => Creates 5.4.3.102.blacklist.com
            and resolves to 127.0.0.1
          + 102.3.4.6 is not => 6.4.3.102.blacklist.com is not found, or
            default to 127.0.0.2
          + E-mail servers can then query blacklist.com through the DNS
            mechanism to find out if a specific host connecting to them
            are in the blacklist. Today many of such blacklists, either
            free or subscription-based, are available mainly for use by
            email administrators and anti-spam software.

     * Software Updates: many anti-virus and commercial software now use
       the DNS system to store version numbers of the latest software
       updates so client computers do not need to connect to the update
       servers every time. For these type of applications, the cache time
       of the DNS records are usually shorter.

     * [208]Sender Policy Framework and [209]DomainKeys, instead of
       creating their own record types, were designed to take advantage of
       another DNS record type, the TXT record.
     * To provide resilience in the event of computer failure, multiple
       DNS servers are usually provided for coverage of each domain, and
       at the top level, thirteen very powerful [210]root servers exist,
       with additional "copies" of several of them distributed worldwide
       via [211]Anycast.

[[212]edit] Protocol details

   DNS primarily uses [213]UDP on [214]port 53 ^[215][8] to serve
   requests. Almost all DNS queries consist of a single UDP request from
   the client followed by a single UDP reply from the server. [216]TCP
   comes into play only when the response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or
   for such tasks as [217]zone transfer. Some operating systems such as
   [218]HP-UX are known to have resolver implementations that use TCP for
   all queries, even when UDP would suffice.

[[219]edit] Extensions to DNS

   [220]EDNS is an extension of the DNS protocol which allows the
   transport over UDP of DNS replies exceeding 512 bytes, and adds support
   for expanding the space of request and response codes. It is described
   in [221]RFC 2671.

[[222]edit] DNS resource records

          Further information: [223]List of DNS record types

   A Resource Record (RR) is the basic data element in the domain name
   system. Each record has a type (A, MX, etc.), a [224]TTL, a class and
   some type-specific information. All resource records of the same type
   define a Resource Record Set (RR set). The order that resource records
   in a RR set are returned by the resolver to an application is undefined
   (the server typically uses [225]round-robin DNS). [226]DNSSEC, however,
   works on complete RR sets in a canonical order.

   When sent over the Internet, all records use the common format
   specified in [227]RFC 1035 shown below.

   CAPTION: RR (Resource record) fields

    Field                     Description                   Length ([228]octets)
   NAME     Name of the node to which this record pertains. (variable)
   TYPE     Type of RR. For example, MX is type 15.         2
   CLASS    Class code.                                     2
   [229]TTL Signed time in seconds that RR stays valid.     4
   RDLENGTH Length of RDATA field.                          2
   RDATA    Additional RR-specific data.                    (variable)

   The NAME is the [230]fully qualified domain name of the node in the
   tree. On the wire, the name may be shortened using label compression
   where ends of domain names mentioned earlier in the packet can be
   substituted for the end of the current domain name.

   The TYPE of the record indicates what the format of the data is, and
   gives a hint of its intended use; for instance, the A record is used to
   translate from a domain name to an [231]IPv4 address, the NS record
   lists which [232]name servers can answer lookups on a [233]DNS zone,
   and the MX record is used to translate from a name in the right-hand
   side of an [234]e-mail address to the name of a machine able to handle
   mail for that address.

   The RDATA is type-specific information, such as the actual IP address
   for A records, or the mail host for MX records. Well known record types
   may use label compression in the RDATA field, but "unknown" record
   types can not (see [235]RFC 3597).

   The CLASS of a record is almost always set to "IN" or "Internet". There
   are also the very rarely used "CH" (Chaos) and "HS" ([236]Hesiod)
   classes. In theory, each class can be completely independent trees with
   different delegation [237]DNS zones and different names, but in
   practice they all mirrored the Internet class.

   In addition to resource records defined in a [238]zone file, there are
   also some pseudo record types that are used only on the wire, such as
   to perform zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR) or for [239]EDNS (OPT).

[[240]edit] Internationalized domain names

          Main article: [241]Internationalized domain name

   While domain names technically have no restrictions on the characters
   they use and can include non-[242]ASCII characters, the same is not
   true for host names.^[243][9] Host names are the names most people see
   and use for things like e-mail and web browsing. [244]Host names are
   restricted to a small subset of the ASCII character set known as LDH,
   the Letters AZ in upper and lower case, Digits 09, H[245]yphen, and the
   dot to separate LDH-labels; see [246]RFC 3696 section 2 for details.
   This prevented the representation of names and words of many languages
   natively. [247]ICANN has approved the [248]Punycode-based [249]IDNA
   system, which maps [250]Unicode strings into the valid DNS character
   set, as a workaround to this issue. Some [251]registries have adopted
   IDNA.

[[252]edit] Security issues

   DNS was not originally designed with security in mind, and thus has a
   number of security issues.

   One class of vulnerabilities is [253]DNS cache poisoning, which tricks
   a DNS server into believing it has received authentic information when,
   in reality, it has not.

   DNS responses are traditionally not cryptographically signed, leading
   to many attack possibilities; The [254]Domain Name System Security
   Extensions (DNSSEC) modifies DNS to add support for cryptographically
   signed responses. There are various extensions to support securing zone
   transfer information as well.

   Even with encryption, a DNS server could become compromised by a virus
   (or for that matter a disgruntled employee) that would cause IP
   addresses of that server to be redirected to a malicious address with a
   long TTL. This could have far-reaching impact to potentially millions
   of Internet users if busy DNS servers cache the bad IP data. This would
   require manual purging of all affected DNS caches as required by the
   long TTL (up to 68 years).

   Some domain names can spoof other, similar-looking domain names. For
   example, "paypal.com" and "paypa1.com" are different names, yet users
   may be unable to tell the difference when the user's [255]typeface
   (font) does not clearly differentiate the letter [256]l and the numeral
   [257]1. This problem is much more serious in systems that support
   [258]internationalized domain names, since many characters that are
   different, from the point of view of [259]ISO 10646, appear identical
   on typical computer screens. This vulnerability is often exploited in
   [260]phishing.

   Techniques such as [261]Forward Confirmed reverse DNS can also be used
   to help validate DNS results.

[[262]edit] Domain registration

   The right to use a domain name is delegated by [263]domain name
   registrars which are accredited by the [264]Internet Corporation for
   Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the organization charged with
   overseeing the name and number systems of the Internet. In addition to
   ICANN, each top-level domain (TLD) is maintained and serviced
   technically by a sponsoring organization, the TLD Registry. The
   registry is responsible for maintaining the database of names
   registered within the TLDs they administer. The registry receives
   registration information from each domain name registrar authorized to
   assign names in the corresponding TLD and publishes the information
   using a special service, the [265]whois protocol.

   Registrars usually charge an annual fee for the service of delegating a
   domain name to a user and providing a default set of name servers.
   Often this transaction is termed a sale or lease of the domain name,
   and the registrant is called an "owner", but no such legal relationship
   is actually associated with the transaction, only the exclusive right
   to use the domain name. More correctly authorized users are known as
   "registrants" or as "domain holders".

   [266]ICANN publishes a complete list of TLD registries and domain name
   registrars in the world. One can obtain information about the
   registrant of a domain name by looking in the [267]WHOIS database held
   by many domain registries.

   For most of the more than 240 [268]country code top-level domains
   (ccTLDs), the domain registries hold the authoritative WHOIS
   (Registrant, name servers, expiration dates, etc.). For instance,
   [269]DENIC, Germany NIC, holds the authoritative WHOIS to a .DE domain
   name. Since about 2001, most [270]gTLD registries (.ORG, .BIZ, .INFO)
   have adopted this so-called "thick" registry approach, i.e. keeping the
   authoritative [271]WHOIS in the central registries instead of the
   registrars.

   For .COM and .NET domain names, a "thin" registry is used: the domain
   registry (e.g. VeriSign) holds a basic WHOIS (registrar and name
   servers, etc.). One can find the detailed [272]WHOIS (registrant,
   [273]name servers, expiry dates, etc.) at the registrars.

   Some domain name registries, also called Network Information Centres
   (NIC), also function as registrars, and deal directly with end users.
   But most of the main ones, such as for .COM, .NET, .ORG, .INFO, etc.,
   use a registry-registrar model. There are hundreds of Domain Name
   Registrars that actually perform the domain name registration with the
   end user (see lists at [274]ICANN or [275]VeriSign). By using this
   method of distribution, the registry only has to manage the
   relationship with the registrar, and the registrar maintains the
   relationship with the end users, or 'registrants' -- in some cases
   through additional layers of resellers.

   In the process of registering a domain name and maintaining authority
   over the new name space created, registrars store and use several key
   pieces of information connected with a domain:
     * Administrative contact. A registrant usually designates an
       administrative contact to manage the domain name. The
       administrative contact usually has the highest level of control
       over a domain. Management functions delegated to the administrative
       contacts may include management of all business information, such
       as name of record, postal address, and contact information of the
       official registrant of the domain and the obligation to conform to
       the requirements of the domain registry in order to retain the
       right to use a domain name. Furthermore the administrative contact
       installs additional contact information for technical and billing
       functions.
     * Technical contact. The technical contact manages the name servers
       of a domain name. The functions of a technical contact include
       assuring conformance of the configurations of the domain name with
       the requirements of the domain registry, maintaining the domain
       zone records, and providing continuous functionality of the name
       servers (that leads to the accessibility of the domain name).
     * Billing contact. The party responsible for receiving billing
       invoices from the [276]domain name registrar and paying applicable
       fees.
     * Name servers. Domains usually need at least two [277]authoritative
       name servers that perform name resolution for the domain. If they
       are not automatically provided by the registrar, the domain holder
       must specify domain names and IP addresses for these servers.

[[278]edit] Abuse and regulation

   Critics often claim abuse of administrative power over domain names.
   Particularly noteworthy was the [279]VeriSign [280]Site Finder system
   which redirected all unregistered .com and .net domains to a VeriSign
   webpage. For example, at a public meeting with VeriSign to air
   technical concerns about SiteFinder ^[281][10], numerous people, active
   in the [282]IETF and other technical bodies, explained how they were
   surprised by VeriSign's changing the fundamental behavior of a major
   component of Internet infrastructure, not having obtained the customary
   consensus. SiteFinder, at first, assumed every Internet query was for a
   website, and it monetized queries for incorrect domain names, taking
   the user to VeriSign's search site. Unfortunately, other applications,
   such as many implementations of email, treat a lack of response to a
   domain name query as an indication that the domain does not exist, and
   that the message can be treated as undeliverable. The original VeriSign
   implementation broke this assumption for mail, because it would always
   resolve an erroneous domain name to that of SiteFinder. While VeriSign
   later changed SiteFinder's behaviour with regard to email, there was
   still widespread protest about VeriSign's action being more in its
   financial interest than in the interest of the Internet infrastructure
   component for which VeriSign was the steward.

   Despite widespread criticism, VeriSign only reluctantly removed it
   after the [283]Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
   (ICANN) threatened to revoke its contract to administer the root name
   servers. ICANN published the extensive set of letters exchanged,
   committee reports, and ICANN decisions ^[284][11].

   There is also significant disquiet regarding the United States'
   political influence over ICANN. This was a significant issue in the
   attempt to create a [285].xxx [286]top-level domain and sparked greater
   interest in [287]alternative DNS roots that would be beyond the control
   of any single country.^[288][12]

   Additionally, there are numerous accusations of domain name "front
   running", whereby registrars, when given whois queries, automatically
   register the domain name for themselves. Recently, Network Solutions
   has been accused of this.^[289][13]

[[290]edit] Truth in Domain Names Act

          Main article: [291]Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act

   In the United States, the "Truth in Domain Names Act" (actually the
   "Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act"), in combination with the
   [292]PROTECT Act, forbids the use of a misleading domain name with the
   intention of attracting people into viewing a [293]visual depiction of
   sexually explicit conduct on the Internet.
