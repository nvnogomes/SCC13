Edentulism

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edentulism is the condition of being [8]toothless to at least some
   degree; it is the result of [9]tooth loss. Loss of some teeth results
   in partial edentulism, while loss of all teeth results in complete
   edentulism.

   Organisms that never possessed teeth can also be described as
   edentulous, such as members of the former zoological classification
   [10]order of [11]Edentata, which included [12]anteaters, [13]sloths and
   [14]armadillos, all of which possess no [15]anterior teeth and either
   no or poorly-developed [16]posterior teeth.

[[25]edit] Importance of teeth and consequences of edentulism

   For people, the relevance and functionality of teeth can be easily
   taken for granted, but a closer examination of their considerable
   significance will demonstrate how they are actually very important.
   Among other things, teeth serve to:
     * support the lips and cheeks, providing for a fuller, more
       aesthetically pleasing appearance
     * maintain an individual's [26]vertical dimension of occlusion
     * along with the tongue and lips, allow for the proper pronunciation
       of various sounds
     * preserve and maintain the height of the [27]alveolar ridge
     * [28]cut, grind, and otherwise chew food

[[29]edit] Facial support and aesthetics

   When an individual's mouth is at rest, the teeth in the opposing jaws
   are nearly touching; there is what is referred to as a [30]freeway
   space of roughly 2-3 mm. However, this distance is partially maintained
   as a result of the teeth limiting any further closure past the point of
   [31]maximum intercuspation. When there are no teeth present in the
   mouth, the natural [32]vertical dimension of occlusion is lost and the
   mouth as a tendency to overclose. This causes the cheeks to exhibit a
   "sunken-in" appearance and wrinkle lines to form at the [33]commisures.
   Additionally, the [34]anterior teeth, when present, serve to properly
   support the lips and provide for certain aesthetic features, such as an
   [35]acute [36]nasiolabial angle. Loss of [37]muscle tone and skin
   elasticity due to old age, when most individuals begin to experience
   edentulism, tend to further exacerbate this condition.

   The [38]tongue, which consists of a very dynamic group of muscles,
   tends to fill the space it is allowed, and in the absence of teeth,
   will broaden out.^[39][1] This makes it initially difficult to
   fabricate both [40]complete dentures and [41]removable partial dentures
   for patients exhibiting complete and partial edentulism, respectively;
   however, once the space is "taken back" by the prosthetic teeth, the
   tongue will return to a narrower body.

[[42]edit] Vertical dimension of occlusion

   As stated, the position of maximal closure in the presence of teeth is
   referred to as [43]maximum intercuspation, and the vertical jaw
   relationship in this position is referred to as the [44]vertical
   dimension of occlusion. With the loss of teeth, there is a decrease in
   this vertical dimension, as the mouth is allowed to overclose when
   there are no teeth present to block further upward movement of the
   [45]mandible towards the [46]maxilla. This may contribute, as explained
   above, to a sunken-in appearance of the cheeks, because there is now
   "too much" cheek than is needed to extend from the maxilla to the
   mandible when in an overclosed position. If this situation is left
   untreated for a many years, the muscles and tendons of the mandible and
   the [47]TMJ may manifest with alterred tone and elasticity.

[[48]edit] Pronunciation

   The teeth play a major role in speech. Some letter sounds require the
   lips and/or tongue to make contact with teeth for proper pronunciation
   of the sound, and lack of teeth will obviously affect the way in which
   an edentulous individual can pronounce these sounds.

   For example, the [49]fricative consonant sounds of the [50]English
   language s, z, x, d, n, l, j, t, th, ch and sh are achieved with
   tongue-to-tooth contact, and the fricative f and v are achieved through
   lip-to-tooth contact. These sounds are very difficult to properly
   enunciate for the edentulous individual.

[[51]edit] Preservation of alveolar ridge height

   The green line indicates the [52]faciolingual dimensions of a newly
   edentulous ridge, while the blue line indicates these dimensions after
   the occurrence of very severe resorption.

   The [53]alveolar ridges are columns of bone that surround and anchor
   the teeth and run the entire length, [54]mesiodistally, of both the
   [55]maxillary and [56]mandibular dental arches. The alveolar bone is
   unique in that it exists for the sake of the teeth that it retains;
   when the teeth are absent, the bone slowly [57]resorbs. The maxilla
   resorbs in a [58]superioposterior direction, and the mandible resorbs
   in an [59]inferioanterior direction, thus eventually converting an
   individual's [60]occlusal scheme from a [61]Class I to a [62]Class III.

   In addition to this resorption of bone in the vertical and
   anterioposterior dimensions, the alveolus also resorbs
   [63]faciolingually, thus diminishing the width of the ridge. What
   initially began as a sort of tall, broad, [64]bell curve-shaped ridge
   (in the faciolingual dimension) eventually becomes a short, narrow,
   stumpy sort of what doesn't even appear to be a ridge. Resorption is
   exacerbated by pressure on the bone; thus, long-term [65]complete
   denture wearers will experience more drastic reductions to their ridges
   that non-denture wearers. Those individuals who do wear dentures can
   decrease the amount of bone loss by retaining some tooth roots in the
   form of overdenture abutments or have [66]implants placed. Note that
   the depiction above shows a very excessive change and that this many
   take many years of denture wear to achieve.

   Ridge resorption may also alter the form of the ridges to less
   predictable shapes, such as bulbous ridges with undercuts or even
   sharp, thin, knife-edged ridges, depending of which of many possible
   factors influenced the resorption.

[[67]edit] Masticatory efficiency

   Physiologically, teeth provide for greater chewing ability. They allow
   us to [68]masticate food thoroughly, increasing the surface area
   necessary to allow for the [69]enzymes present in the saliva, as well
   as in the stomach and intestines, to digest our food. Chewing also
   allows food to be prepared into small [70]boli that are more readily
   swallowed than haphazard chunks of considerable size. For those who are
   even partially endentulous, it may become extremely difficult to chew
   food efficiently enough to swallow comfortably, although this is
   entirely dependent upon which teeth are lost. When an individual loses
   enough posterior teeth to make it difficult to chew, he or she may need
   to cut their food into very small pieces and learn how to make use of
   their anterior teeth to chew. If enough posterior teeth are missing,
   this will not only affect their chewing abilities, but also their
   [71]occlusion; posterior teeth, in a [72]mutually protected occlusion,
   help to protect the anterior teeth and the [73]vertical dimension of
   occlusion and, when missing, the anterior teeth begin to bear a greater
   amount of force for which they are structurally prepared. Thus, loss of
   posterior teeth will cause the anterior teeth to splay. This can be
   prevented by obtaining dental prostheses, such as [74]removable partial
   dentures, [75]bridges or [76]implant-supported crowns. In addition to
   reestablishing a protected occlusion, these prostheses can greatly
   improve one's chewing abilities.

   As a consequence of a lack of certain nutrition due to altered eating
   habits, various health problems can occur, from the mild to the
   extreme. Lack of certain [77]vitamins ([78]A, [79]E and [80]C) and low
   levels of [81]riboflavin and [82]thyamin can produce a variety of
   conditions, ranging from [83]constipation, weight loss, [84]arthritis
   and [85]rheumatism. There are more serious conditions such as heart
   disease and [86]Parkinson's disease and even to the extreme, certain
   types of [87]Cancer.

   Numerous studies linking edentulism with instances of disease and
   medical conditions have been reported. In a cross-sectional study,
   Hamasha and others found significant differences between edentulous and
   dentate individuals with respect to rates of atherosclerotic vascular
   disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and joint
   disease.^[88][2]

[[89]edit] [90]Etiology

   This [91]X-ray film displays two lone-standing teeth, #21 and #22, as
   the remnants of a once full complement of 16 lower teeth. This case of
   partial edentulism is the result of [92]periodontal disease, as is
   suggested by the substantial bone loss on the two remaining teeth.

   The etiology, or cause of edentulism, can be multifaceted. While the
   extraction of non-restorable or non-strategic teeth by a dentist does
   contribute to edentulism, the predominant cause of tooth loss in
   developed countries is [93]periodontal disease. While the teeth may
   remain completely [94]decay-free, the [95]bone surrounding and
   providing support to the teeth may resorb and disappear, giving rise to
   tooth mobility and eventual tooth loss. In the photo at right, tooth
   #21 (the lower left first premolar, to the right of #22, the lower left
   canine) exhibits 50% bone loss, presenting with a [96]distal
   [97]horizontal defect and a [98]mesial [99]vertical defect. Tooth #22
   exhibits roughly 30% bone loss.
