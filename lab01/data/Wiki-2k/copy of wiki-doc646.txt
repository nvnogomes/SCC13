   The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill
   levels of players in two-player games such as [14]chess and [15]Go. It
   is named after its creator [16]Arpad Elo (19031992, born as l rpd), a
   [17]Hungarian-born [18]American [19]physics professor.

   The Elo system was invented as an improved chess rating system, but
   today it is also used in many other games. It is also used as a rating
   system for multiplayer competition in a number of [20]computer games,
   and has been adapted to team sports including [21]association football,
   American college football and basketball, and [22]Major League
   Baseball.

   Arpad Elo was a master-level chess player and an active participant in
   the [57]United States Chess Federation (USCF) from its founding in
   1939.^[58][1] The USCF used a numerical ratings system, devised by
   [59]Kenneth Harkness, to allow members to track their individual
   progress in terms other than tournament wins and losses. The Harkness
   system was reasonably fair, but in some circumstances gave rise to
   ratings which many observers considered inaccurate. On behalf of the
   USCF, Elo devised a new system with a more [60]statistical basis.

   Elo's system replaced earlier systems of competitive rewards with a
   system based on statistical estimation. Rating systems for many sports
   award points in accordance with subjective evaluations of the
   'greatness' of certain achievements. For example, winning an important
   [61]golf tournament might be worth an arbitrarily chosen five times as
   many points as winning a lesser tournament.

   A statistical endeavor, by contrast, uses a model that relates the game
   results to underlying variables representing the ability of each
   player.

   Elo's central assumption was that the chess performance of each player
   in each game is a [62]normally distributed [63]random variable.
   Although a player might perform significantly better or worse from one
   game to the next, Elo assumed that the mean value of the performances
   of any given player changes only slowly over time. Elo thought of a
   player's true skill as the mean of that player's performance random
   variable.

   A further assumption is necessary, because chess performance in the
   above sense is still not measurable. One cannot look at a sequence of
   moves and say, "That performance is 2039." Performance can only be
   inferred from wins, draws and losses. Therefore, if a player wins a
   game, he is assumed to have performed at a higher level than his
   opponent for that game. Conversely if he loses, he is assumed to have
   performed at a lower level. If the game is a draw, the two players are
   assumed to have performed at nearly the same level.

   Elo did not specify exactly how close two performances ought to be to
   result in a draw as opposed to a win or loss. And while he thought it
   likely that each player might have a different [64]standard deviation
   to his performance, he made a simplifying assumption to the contrary.

   To simplify computation even further, Elo proposed a straightforward
   method of estimating the variables in his model (i.e., the true skill
   of each player). One could calculate relatively easily, from tables,
   how many games a player is expected to win based on a comparison of his
   rating to the ratings of his opponents. If a player won more games than
   he was expected to win, his rating would be adjusted upward, while if
   he won fewer games than expected his rating would be adjusted downward.
   Moreover, that adjustment was to be in exact linear proportion to the
   number of wins by which the player had exceeded or fallen short of his
   expected number of wins.

   From a modern perspective, Elo's simplifying assumptions are not
   necessary because computing power is inexpensive and widely available.
   Moreover, even within the simplified model, more efficient estimation
   techniques are well known. Several people, most notably [65]Mark
   Glickman, have proposed using more sophisticated statistical machinery
   to estimate the same variables. On the other hand, the computational
   simplicity of the Elo system has proven to be one of its greatest
   assets. With the aid of a pocket calculator, an informed chess
   competitor can calculate to within one point what his next officially
   published rating will be, which helps promote a perception that the
   ratings are fair.

[[66]edit] Implementing Elo's scheme

   The USCF implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960,^[67][2] and the system
   quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than
   the Harkness system. Elo's system was adopted by [68]FIDE in 1970. Elo
   described his work in some detail in the book The Rating of
   Chessplayers, Past and Present, published in 1978.

   Subsequent statistical tests have shown that chess performance is
   almost certainly not normally distributed. Weaker players have
   significantly greater winning chances than Elo's model predicts.
   Therefore, both the USCF and FIDE have switched to formulas based on
   the [69]logistic distribution. However, in deference to Elo's
   contribution, both organizations are still commonly said to use "the
   Elo system".

[[70]edit] Different ratings systems

   The phrase "Elo rating" is often used to mean a player's chess rating
   as calculated by FIDE. However, this usage is confusing and often
   misleading, because Elo's general ideas have been adopted by many
   different organizations, including the USCF (before FIDE), the
   [71]Internet Chess Club (ICC), [72]Yahoo! Games, and the now defunct
   [73]Professional Chess Association (PCA). Each organization has a
   unique implementation, and none of them precisely follows Elo's
   original suggestions. It would be more accurate to refer to all of the
   above ratings as Elo ratings, and none of them as the Elo rating.

   Instead one may refer to the organization granting the rating, e.g. "As
   of August 2002, [74]Gregory Kaidanov had a FIDE rating of 2638 and a
   USCF rating of 2742." It should be noted that the Elo ratings of these
   various organizations are not always directly comparable. For example,
   someone with a FIDE rating of 2500 will generally have a USCF rating
   near 2600 and an ICC rating in the range of 2500 to 3100.

[[75]edit] FIDE ratings

   For top players, the most important rating is their [76]FIDE rating.
   [77]FIDE issues a ratings list four times a year.

   The following analysis of the January 2006 FIDE rating list gives a
   rough impression of what a given FIDE rating means:
     * 17171 players have a rating between 2200 and 2399, and are usually
       associated with the [78]Candidate Master title.
     * 1868 players have a rating between 2400 and 2499, most of whom have
       either the [79]IM or the [80]GM title.
     * 563 players have a rating between 2500 and 2599, most of whom have
       the [81]GM title
     * 123 players have a rating between 2600 and 2699, all (but one) of
       whom have the [82]GM title
     * 18 players have a rating between 2700 and 2799
     * Only 4 players ([83]Garry Kasparov, [84]Vladimir Kramnik,
       [85]Veselin Topalov and [86]Viswanathan Anand) have ever exceeded a
       rating of 2800, and only Topalov does in the latest (January 2009)
       list.

   The highest ever FIDE rating was 2851, which Garry Kasparov had on the
   July 1999 and January 2000 lists.

   In the whole history of FIDE rating system, only 48 players (to October
   2007), sometimes called [87]"Super-grandmasters", have achieved a peak
   rating of 2700 or more.

[[88]edit] Performance rating

   Performance Rating is a hypothetical rating that would result from the
   games of a single event only. Some chess organizations use the
   "algorithm of 400" to calculate performance rating. According to this
   algorithm, performance rating for an event is calculated by taking (1)
   the rating of each player beaten and adding 400, (2) the rating of each
   player lost to and subtracting 400, (3) the rating of each player
   drawn, and (4) summing these figures and dividing by the number of
   games played.

   [89]FIDE, however, calculates performance rating by means of the
   formula: Opponents' Rating Average + Rating Difference. Rating
   Difference d[p] is based on a player's tournament percentage score p,
   which is then used as the key in a lookup table. p is simply the number
   of points scored devided by the number of games played. Note that, in
   case of a perfect or no score d[p] is indeterminate. The full table can
   be found in the [90]FIDE handbook online. A simplified version of this
   table looks like this:
    p   d[p]
   0.99 +677
   0.9  +366
   0.8  +240
   0.7  +149
   0.6  +72
   0.5  0
   0.4  -72
   0.3  -149
   0.2  -240
   0.1  -366
   0.01 -677

[[91]edit] FIDE tournament categories

   [92]FIDE classifies tournaments into categories according to the
   average rating of the players. Each category is 25 rating points wide.
   Category 1 is for an average rating of 2251 to 2275, category 2 is 2276
   to 2300, etc.^[93][3] The highest rated tournaments have been Category
   21, with an average from 2751 to 2775. The top categories are as
   follows:
   Category                 Meaning
   15       Average rating is in range 2601 to 2625
   16       Average rating is in range 2626 to 2650
   17       Average rating is in range 2651 to 2675
   18       Average rating is in range 2676 to 2700
   19       Average rating is in range 2701 to 2725
   20       Average rating is in range 2726 to 2750
   21       Average rating is in range 2751 to 2775

[[94]edit] Live ratings

   [95]FIDE updates its ratings list every three months. In contrast, the
   unofficial "Live ratings" calculate the change in players' ratings
   after every game. These Live ratings are based on the previously
   published FIDE ratings, so a player's Live rating is intended to
   correspond to what the FIDE rating would be if FIDE was to issue a new
   list that day.

   Although Live ratings are unofficial, interest arose in Live ratings in
   August/September 2008 when five different players took the "Live" #1
   ranking.^[96][4]

   The unofficial live ratings are published and maintained by Hans Arild
   Runde at [97]http://chess.liverating.org . Only players over 2700 are
   covered.

[[98]edit] United States Chess Federation ratings

   The [99]United States Chess Federation (USCF) uses its own
   classification of players: ^[100][5]
     * 2400 and above: Senior Master
     * 22002399: Master
     * 20002199: Expert
     * 18001999: Class A
     * 16001799: Class B
     * 14001599: Class C
     * 12001399: Class D
     * 10001199: Class E

   In general, 1000 is considered a bright beginner. A regular competitive
   chess player might be rated at approximately 1750.^[[101]citation
   needed]

   The K factor, in the USCF rating system, can be estimated by dividing
   800 by the effective number of games a player's rating is based on (Ne)
   plus the number of games the player completed in a tournament
   (m).^[102][6]

          K = 800 / (Ne + m)\,

[[103]edit] Ratings of computers

   Since 20052006, [104]human-computer chess matches have demonstrated
   that [105]chess computers are stronger than the strongest human
   players. However ratings of computers are difficult to quantify. There
   have been too few games under tournament conditions to give computers
   or software engines an accurate rating.^[106][7] Also, for [107]chess
   engines, the rating is dependent on the machine a program runs on.

   For some ratings estimates, see [108]Chess Engines rating lists.

[[109]edit] Theory

[[110]edit] Mathematical details

   Performance can't be measured absolutely; it can only be inferred from
   wins and losses. Ratings therefore have meaning only relative to other
   ratings. Therefore, both the average and the spread of ratings can be
   arbitrarily chosen. Elo suggested scaling ratings so that a difference
   of 200 rating points in chess would mean that the stronger player has
   an expected score of approximately 0.75, and the USCF initially aimed
   for an average club player to have a rating of 1500.

   A player's expected score is his probability of winning plus half his
   probability of drawing. Thus an expected score of 0.75 could represent
   a 75% chance of winning, 25% chance of losing, and 0% chance of
   drawing. On the other extreme it could represent a 50% chance of
   winning, 0% chance of losing, and 50% chance of drawing. The
   probability of drawing, as opposed to having a decisive result, is not
   specified in the Elo system. Instead a draw is considered half a win
   and half a loss.

   If Player A has true strength R[A] and Player B has true strength R[B],
   the exact formula (using the [111]logistic curve) for the expected
   score of Player A is

          E_A = \frac 1 {1 + 10^{(R_B - R_A)/400}}.

   Similarly the expected score for Player B is

          E_B = \frac 1 {1 + 10^{(R_A - R_B)/400}}.

   This could also be expressed by

          E_A = \frac{Q_A}{Q_A + Q_B}

   and

          E_B = \frac{Q_B}{Q_A + Q_B}

   where Q_A = 10^{R_A/400} and Q_B = 10^{R_B/400} . Note that the same
   denominator applies to both expressions. This means that by studying
   only the numerators, we find out that player A has about Q[A] / Q[B]
   times greater chance of winning as player B. It then follows that for
   each 400 rating points of advantage over the opponent, the chance of
   winning is magnified ten times in comparsion to the opponent's chance
   of winning.

   Also note that E[A] + E[B] = 1. In practice, since the true strength of
   each player is unknown, the expected scores are calculated using the
   player's current ratings.

   When a player's actual tournament scores exceed his expected scores,
   the Elo system takes this as evidence that player's rating is too low,
   and needs to be adjusted upward. Similarly when a player's actual
   tournament scores fall short of his expected scores, that player's
   rating is adjusted downward. Elo's original suggestion, which is still
   widely used, was a simple linear adjustment proportional to the amount
   by which a player overperformed or underperformed his expected score.
   The maximum possible adjustment per game (sometimes called the
   [112]K-value) was set at K = 16 for masters and K = 32 for weaker
   players.

   Supposing Player A was expected to score E[A] points but actually
   scored S[A] points. The formula for updating his rating is

          R_A^\prime = R_A + K(S_A - E_A).

   This update can be performed after each game or each tournament, or
   after any suitable rating period. An example may help clarify. Suppose
   Player A has a rating of 1613, and plays in a five-round tournament. He
   loses to a player rated 1609, draws with a player rated 1477, defeats a
   player rated 1388, defeats a player rated 1586, and loses to a player
   rated 1720. His actual score is (0 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0) = 2.5. His
   expected score, calculated according to the formula above, was (0.506 +
   0.686 + 0.785 + 0.539 + 0.351) = 2.867. Therefore his new rating is
   (1613 + 32 (2.5 2.867)) = 1601.

   Note that while two wins, two losses, and one draw may seem like a par
   score, it is worse than expected for Player A because his opponents
   were lower rated on average. Therefore he is slightly penalized. If he
   had scored two wins, one loss, and two draws, for a total score of
   three points, that would have been slightly better than expected, and
   his new rating would have been (1613 + 32 (3 2.867)) = 1617.

   This updating procedure is at the core of the ratings used by FIDE,
   USCF, Yahoo! Games, the ICC, and FICS. However, each organization has
   taken a different route to deal with the uncertainty inherent in the
   ratings, particularly the ratings of newcomers, and to deal with the
   problem of ratings inflation/deflation. New players are assigned
   provisional ratings, which are adjusted more drastically than
   established ratings, and various methods (none completely successful)
   have been devised to inject points into the rating system so that
   ratings from different eras are roughly comparable.

   The principles used in these rating systems can be used for rating
   other competitionsfor instance, international [113]football matches.

   Elo ratings have also been applied to games without the possibility of
   [114]draws, and to games in which the result can also have a quantity
   (small/big margin) in addition to the quality (win/loss). See [115]go
   rating with Elo for more.

   See also: [116]Hubbert curve for the similarity between the derivative
   of the [117]logistic curve and the [118]normal distribution.

[[119]edit] Mathematical issues

   There are three main mathematical concerns relating to the original
   work of Professor Elo, namely the correct curve, the correct K-factor,
   and the provisional period crude calculations.

[[120]edit] Most accurate distribution model

   The first major mathematical concern addressed by both FIDE and the
   USCF was the use of the [121]normal distribution. They found that this
   did not accurately represent the actual results achieved by
   particularly the lower rated players. Instead they switched to a
   [122]logistical distribution model, which seemed to provide a better
   fit for the actual results achieved.

[[123]edit] Most accurate K-factor

   The second major concern is the correct "K-factor" used. The chess
   statistician [124]Jeff Sonas reckons that the original K=10 value (for
   players rated above 2400) is inaccurate in Elo's work. If the K-factor
   coefficient is set too large, there will be too much sensitivity to
   winning, losing or drawing, in terms of the large number of points
   exchanged. Too low a K-value, and the sensitivity will be minimal, and
   it would be hard to achieve a significant number of points for winning,
   etc.

   Elo's original K-factor estimation, was based without the benefit of
   huge databases and statistical evidence. Sonas indicates that a
   K-factor of 24 (for players rated above 2400) may be more accurate both
   as a predictive tool of future performance, and also more sensitive to
   performance.^[125][8]

   Certain Internet chess sites seem to avoid a three-level K-factor
   staggering based on rating range. For example the ICC seems to adopt a
   global K=32 except when playing against provisionally rated players.
   The USCF (which makes use of a logistic distribution as opposed to a
   normal distribution) have staggered the K-factor according to three
   main rating ranges of:
     * Players below 2100 -> K factor of 32 used
     * Players between 2100 and 2400 -> K factor of 24 used
     * Players above 2400 -> K factor of 16 used

   FIDE uses the following ranges^[126][9]:
     * K = 25 for a player new to the rating list until he has completed
       events with a total of at least 30 games.
     * K = 15 as long as a player's rating remains under 2400.
     * K = 10 once a player's published rating has reached 2400, and he
       has also completed events with a total of at least 30 games.
       Thereafter it remains permanently at 10.

   In over-the-board chess, the staggering of K-factor is important to
   ensure minimal inflation at the top end of the rating spectrum. This
   assumption might in theory apply equally to an online chess server, as
   well as a standard over-the-board chess organisation such as FIDE or
   USCF. In theory, it would make it harder for players to get the much
   higher ratings, if their K-factor sensitivity was lessened from 32 to
   16 for example, when they get over 2400 rating. However, the ICC's help
   on K-factors indicates^[127][10] that it may simply be the choosing of
   opponents that enables 2800+ players to further increase their rating
   quite easily. This would seem to hold true, for example, if one
   analysed the games of a GM on the ICC: one can find a string of games
   of opponents who are all over 3100. In over-the-board chess, it would
   only be in very high level all-play-all events that this player would
   be able to find a steady stream of 2700+ opponents in at least a
   category 15+ FIDE event. A category 10 FIDE event would mean players
   are restricted in rating between 2476 to 2500. However, if the player
   entered normal Swiss-paired open over-the-board chess tournaments, he
   would likely meet many opponents less than 2500 FIDE on a regular
   basis. A single loss or draw against a player rated less than 2500
   would knock the GM's FIDE rating down significantly.

   Even if the K-factor was 16, and the player defeated a 3100+ player
   several games in a row, his rating would still rise quite significantly
   in a short period of time, due to the speed of blitz games, and hence
   the ability to play many games within a few days. The K-factor would
   arguably only slow down the increases that the player achieves after
   each win. The evidence given in the ICC K-factor article relates to the
   auto-pairing system, where the maximum ratings achieved are seen to be
   only about 2500. So it seems that random-pairing as opposed to
   selective pairing is the key for combatting rating inflation at the top
   end of the rating spectrum, and possibly only to a much lesser extent,
   a slightly lower K-factor for a player >2400 rating.

   In general the Elo system has increased the competitive climate for
   chess and inspired players for further study and improvement of their
   game.^[[138]citation needed] However, in some cases ratings can
   discourage game activity for players who wish to "protect their
   rating".

   Examples:
    1. They may choose their events or opponents more carefully where
       possible.
    2. If a player is in a [139]Swiss tournament, and loses a couple of
       games in a row, they may feel the need to abandon the tournament in
       order to avoid any further rating "damage".
    3. Junior players, who may have high provisional ratings, and who
       should really be practicing as much as possible,^[[140]citation
       needed] might play less than they would, because of rating
       concerns.

   In these examples, the rating "agenda" can sometimes conflict with the
   agenda of promoting chess activity and rated games. ^[141][11]

   Some of the clash of agendas between game activity, and rating concerns
   is also seen on many servers online which have implemented the Elo
   system. For example, the higher rated players, being much more
   selective in who they play, results often in those players lurking
   around, just waiting for "overvalued" opponents to try to challenge.
   Such players may feel discouraged of course from playing any
   significantly lower rated players again for rating concerns. And so,
   this is one possible anti-activity/anti-social aspect of the Elo rating
   system which needs to be understood. The agenda of points scoring can
   interfere with playing with abandon, and just for fun.^[[142]citation
   needed]

   Interesting from the perspective of preserving high Elo ratings versus
   promoting rated game activity is a recent proposal by British
   Grandmaster [143]John Nunn regarding qualifiers based on Elo rating for
   a World championship model.^[144][12] Nunn highlights in the section on
   "Selection of players", that players not only be selected by high Elo
   ratings, but also their rated game activity. Nunn clearly separates the
   "activity bonus" from the Elo rating, and only implies using it as a
   tie-breaking mechanism.

   The Elo system when applied to casual online servers has at least two
   other major practical issues that need tackling when Elo is applied to
   the context of online chess server ratings. These are engine abuse and
   selective pairing.^[[145]citation needed]

[[146]edit] Chess engines

   The first and most significant issue is players making use of
   [147]chess engines to inflate their ratings. This is particularly an
   issue for [148]correspondence chess style servers and organizations,
   where making use of a wide variety of engines within the same game is
   entirely possible. This would make any attempts to conclusively prove
   that someone is cheating quite futile. [149]Blitz servers such as the
   [150]Free Internet Chess Server or the [151]Internet Chess Club attempt
   to minimize engine bias by clear indications that engine use is not
   allowed when logging on to their server.

[[152]edit] Selective pairing

   A more subtle issue is related to pairing. When players can choose
   their own opponents, they can choose opponents with minimal risk of
   losing, and maximum reward for winning. Such a luxury of being able to
   hand-pick your opponents is not present in Over-the-Board Elo type
   calculations, and therefore this may account strongly for the ratings
   on the ICC using Elo which are well over 2800.

   Particular examples of 2800+ rated players choosing opponents with
   minimal risk and maximum possibility of rating gain include: choosing
   computers that they know they can beat with a certain strategy;
   choosing opponents that they think are over-rated; or avoiding playing
   strong players who are rated several hundred points below them, but may
   hold chess titles such as IM or GM. In the category of choosing
   over-rated opponents, new-entrants to the rating system who have played
   less than 50 games are in theory a convenient target as they may be
   overrated in their provisional rating. The ICC compensates for this
   issue by assigning a lower K-factor to the established player if they
   do win against a new rating entrant. The K-factor is actually a
   function of the number of rated games played by the new entrant.

   Elo therefore must be treated as a bit of fun when applied in the
   context of online server ratings. Indeed the ability to choose one's
   own opponents can have great fun value also for spectators watching the
   very highest rated players. For example they can watch very strong GM's
   challenge other very strong GMs who are also rated over 3100. Such
   opposition, which the highest level players online would play in order
   to maintain their rating, would often be much stronger opponents than
   if they did play in an Open tournament which is run by Swiss pairings.
   Additionally it does help ensure that the game histories of those with
   very high ratings will often be with opponents of similarly high level
   ratings.

   Therefore, Elo ratings online still provide a useful mechanism for
   providing a rating based on the opponent's rating. Its overall
   credibility, however, needs to be seen in the context of at least the
   above two major issues described engine abuse, and selective pairing of
   opponents.

   The ICC has also recently introduced "auto-pairing" ratings which are
   based on random pairings, but with each win in a row ensuring a
   statistically much harder opponent who has also won x games in a row.
   With potentially hundreds of players involved, this creates some of the
   challenges of a major large Swiss event which is being fiercely
   contested, with round winners meeting round winners. This approach to
   pairing certainly maximizes the rating risk of the higher-rated
   participants, who may face very stiff opposition from players below
   3000 for example. This is a separate rating in itself, and is under
   "1-minute" and "5-minute" rating categories. Maximum ratings achieved
   over 2500 are exceptionally rare.

[[153]edit] Ratings inflation and deflation

   This section is written like [159]a personal reflection or essay and
   may require [160]cleanup. Please [161]help improve it by rewriting it
   in an [162]encyclopedic style. (March 2008)

   The primary goal of Elo ratings is to accurately predict game results
   between contemporary competitors, and FIDE ratings perform this task
   relatively well. A secondary, more ambitious goal is to use ratings to
   compare players between different eras. (See also [163]Greatest chess
   player of all time.) It would be convenient if a FIDE rating of 2500
   meant the same thing in 2005 that it meant in 1975. If the ratings
   suffer from inflation, then a modern rating of 2500 means less than a
   historical rating of 2500, while if the ratings suffer from deflation,
   the reverse will be true. Unfortunately, even among people who would
   like ratings from different eras to "mean the same thing", intuitions
   differ sharply as to whether a given rating should represent a fixed
   absolute skill or a fixed relative performance.

   Those who believe in absolute skill (including FIDE^[164][13]) would
   prefer modern ratings to be higher on average than historical ratings,
   if grandmasters nowadays are in fact playing better chess. By this
   standard, the rating system is functioning perfectly if a modern
   2500-rated player and a 2500-rated player of another era would have
   equal chances of winning, were it possible for them to play. The advent
   of strong chess computers allows a somewhat objective evaluation of the
   absolute playing skill of past chess masters, based on their recorded
   games.

   Those who believe in relative performance would prefer the median
   rating (or some other benchmark rank) of all eras to be the same. By
   one relative performance standard, the rating system is functioning
   perfectly if a player in the twentieth percentile of world rankings has
   the same rating as a player in the twentieth percentile used to have.
   Ratings should indicate approximately where a player stands in the
   chess hierarchy of his own era.

   The average FIDE rating of top players has been steadily climbing for
   the past twenty years, which is inflation (and therefore undesirable)
   from the perspective of relative performance. However, it is at least
   plausible that FIDE ratings are not inflating in terms of absolute
   skill. Perhaps modern players are better than their predecessors due to
   a greater knowledge of openings and due to computer-assisted tactical
   training.

   In any event, both camps can agree that it would be undesirable for the
   average rating of players to decline at all, or to rise faster than can
   be reasonably attributed to generally increasing skill. Both camps
   would call the former deflation and the latter inflation. Not only do
   rapid inflation and deflation make comparison between different eras
   impossible, they tend to introduce inaccuracies between more-active and
   less-active contemporaries.

   The most straightforward attempt to avoid rating inflation/deflation is
   to have each game end in an equal transaction of rating points. If the
   winner gains N rating points, the loser should drop by N rating points.
   The intent is to keep the average rating constant, by preventing points
   from entering or leaving the system.

   Unfortunately, this simple approach typically results in rating
   deflation, as the USCF was quick to discover.

   A common misconception is that rating points enter the system every
   time a previously unrated player gets an initial rating and that
   likewise rating points leave the system every time someone retires from
   play. Players generally believe that since most players are
   significantly better at the end of their careers than at the beginning,
   that as they tend to take more points away from the system than they
   brought in, the system deflates as a result. This is a fallacy and is
   easily shown. If a system is deflated, players will have strengths
   higher than their ratings. But if they take points out of the system
   EQUAL TO their strength when they leave the system, no inflation or
   deflation will result.

   Rather, in the "basic form" of the Elo system, the cause of deflation
   is the fact that players improve. The cause of inflation is that their
   strength relative to their rating will tend to decline over time with
   age. Since most players improve early in their career, the system tends
   to deflate at that time. Inflation doesn't occur until much later in a
   player's career. Many players will quit before this natural process
   occurs, which would return points to the system. The net result over
   time is deflation.

[[165]edit] Example

   Both of these misconceptions can be shown incorrect via the following
   example:

   Let's consider the following example, which is a little contrived to
   make it simple. However, the principles remain the same in other pools
   irrespective of the level of complexity.

   Suppose there are four 1500-rated players: A, B, C, D. They are all
   established players. Their ratings are stable. To make the calculations
   easy, we will assume that we will calculate rating changes under the
   old Elo formula with K=32. Suppose that they are the only four players
   in the rating pool. The average rating of the pool is, therefore, 1500.

   Elo recognized that simply having an improving player causes deflation.

   Let's suppose that A decides to study for a while. As a result, his
   strength increases to a degree that on average he scores 3 out of 4
   against B, C, and D. These odds represent roughly a 200 rating point
   spread.

   What we would want the pool to do is this: Since B, C, and D are the
   same strength as before, their ratings should stay at 1500. A should
   see his rating go toward 1700.

   That is, their performances indicate a strength relative to where they
   started of 1500 for B, C, and D and 1700 for A.

   Let's suppose that they play 10 rated games against each opponent (30
   total.) B, C, and D score 50% against each other, but only 25% against
   A, exactly as outlined above. That means B, C, and D win 12.5 games
   each, and A wins 22.5 games. For example, on average, B wins 5 of the
   10 games against C, 5 of the 10 games against D, and 2.5 of the games
   against A.

   What are their ratings (assuming for ease that we rate this as 1 event)
   at the end of these encounters? (This example is simplified, but
   illustrates the point, and the principles hold true even if we treat it
   as several events.)

   The rating formula is:

          (W-We) x 32 + Rating old = Rating new,

   where W equals the number of wins and We equals the expected number of
   wins.

   Since all players started at 1500, we expect them all to score 50%. The
   winning expectancy, We, therefore = 15 for all the players.

   For B, C, D:

          (12.5-15.0) x 32 +1500 = 1420

   12.5 points, for B for example, is 5 points against C, 5 against D, and
   2.5 against A.

   For A:

          (22.5 - 15.0) x 32 + 1500 = 1740

   What is the average rating of the pool? (1420 + 1420 + 1420 +1740)/4 =
   1500.

   Hmm...exactly the same as before.

   Yet, B, C, D are all rated lower than their actual skill level of 1500.
   And even if A loses his "40 extra" points back to the pool fairly
   evenly in another series of games, we would see:

          A: 1700
          B: 1433
          C: 1433
          D: 1433

   That is, 75% of the players in the pool would be deflated, by 67 points
   each, even though the average rating of the entire pool is unchanged.

[[166]edit] Practical approaches

   Because of the significant difference in timing of when inflation and
   deflation occur, and in order to combat deflation, most implementations
   of Elo ratings have a mechanism for injecting points into the system in
   order to maintain relative ratings over time. FIDE has two inflationary
   mechanisms. First, performances below a "ratings floor" are not
   tracked, so a player with true skill below the floor can only be
   unrated or overrated, never correctly rated. Second, established and
   higher-rated players have a lower K-factor.^[167][9] There is no
   theoretical reason why these should provide a proper balance to an
   otherwise deflationary scheme; perhaps they over-correct and result in
   net inflation beyond the playing population's increase in absolute
   skill. On the other hand, there is no obviously superior alternative.
   In particular, on-line game rating systems have seemed to suffer at
   least as many inflation/deflation headaches as FIDE, despite
   alternative stabilization mechanisms.

[[168]edit] Exponential variant

   This section may contain [169]original research or [170]unverified
   claims. Please [171]improve the article by adding [172]references. See
   the [173]talk page for details. (December 2008)

   In many [174]computer role-playing games, the played game character has
   an experience (which can be compared to the rating of a chess player),
   which grows exponentially as the character evolves (while the Elo
   rating of a chess player grows linear as the player
   evolves).^[[175]citation needed] Therefore, in a [176]morpg with
   pairwise battles, it can be a desirable feature to have an experience
   attached to each character which resembles the Elo rating of a chess
   player, but grows exponentially to better match the experience of a
   character in other rpg's.

   Let's call a character's experience Q, and define it as

          Q=C\cdot 10^{R/400}

   where R would be the Elo rating of the character. We then have a
   [177]bijection between R and P, where R = 400log[10](Q / C). Notice
   that the experience will always be positive, while the rating can be
   any real number. Imagine we have two characters, A and B, with the
   experiences Q[A] and Q[B]. In a battle between A and B, the expected
   score of player A can be calculated using the exact formula

          E_A = \frac 1 {1 + 10^{(R_B - R_A)/400}} = \frac 1 {1 +
          10^{(400\log_{10}(Q_B/C) - 400\log_{10}(Q_A/C))/400}} = \frac
          {Q_A}{Q_A+Q_B}.

   So, we have

          E_A = \frac{Q_A}{Q_A + Q_B}

   and the corresponding expression for player B that is

          E_B = \frac{Q_B}{Q_A + Q_B}.

   When the battle is over, by using the formula for updating the rating
   of a character, we can also update the expereince of the character:

          R' = R+K(S-E) \Rightarrow
          Q' = Q\cdot F^{S-E}

   where F = 10^K / 400. A low K values corresponds to an F values close
   to 1. However, while the K value is lower for stronger chess players,
   the F value is often left unchanged, to enable the system to be more
   dynamic (which is a requirement for making a game fun).^[[178]citation
   needed] In opposite to a chess player, a character of a single player
   rpg is made to evolve through out the entire game, as he encounters new
   and better items, develops his skills, learns new spells, etc. In a
   morpg on the other hand, the creators often continuously develop the
   games and create new patches, such as in [179]World of Warcraft. As
   each patch is released, the environment of the game is changed; this
   makes the game more chaotic.

   For low F values, the formula for updating the experience can be
   approximately estimated by

          Q'=Q\cdot(1+\kappa(S-E))

   where \kappa=\ln(F)=\ln(10)/400\cdot K . Using players A and B as
   referrals again, and inserting the formula for the expected score, we
   can substitute E and obtain

          Q'_A=Q_A+\kappa\cdot
          Q_A(S-\frac{Q_A}{Q_A+Q_B})=Q_A+\kappa\frac{S(Q_A^2+Q_A
          Q_B)-Q_A^2}{Q_A+Q_B}

   Now, since S = 1 at win, but 0 at loss, the experience gain is

          \Delta Q_A=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\kappa\displaystyle{\frac{Q_A
          Q_B}{Q_A+Q_B}},&\mbox{ at win }\\
          \\-\kappa\displaystyle{\frac{Q_A^2}{Q_A+Q_B}},&\mbox{ at loss
          }\end{array}\right.

[[180]edit] Single player rpg's

   In many single player rpg's, the character gets an experience boost
   when killing an enemy (i.e. a battle win). Since the character, A,
   often is considered to have much higher experience than an enemy, B,
   the experience gain when killing the enemy can be simplified to

          \Delta Q_A = \kappa\cdot Q_B.

   An even simpler version of this would be to let the character's
   experience be the sum of the experience of all enemies it has killed
   (i.e. having = 1).

   At death, many rpg's just let the player start over from the last
   visited [181]status checkpoint.^[[182]citation needed] Having a single
   player rpg where the character loses experience each time it is killed
   would not be that sensible; firstly the chance of winning a battle is
   drastically decreased when fighting against more than one enemy at a
   time, hence making the expected score misleading. Besides, if the
   character would have it's experience decreased at each death, the
   average experience gain over a longer period of time would be around
   zero, which is not suitable for a single player rpg.

[[183]edit] Other chess rating systems

       Starting in West Germany in 1948, it was used in Germany as
       official rating system of the German Chess Federation until 1992
       when it was replaced by an Elo based rating system. It influenced
       some other rating systems.
     * Harkness System, invented by [184]Kenneth Harkness, who published
       it in 1956. It was used by the USCF from 1950 to 1960 and by some
       other organizations.

     * In November 2005, the [189]Xbox Live online gaming service proposed
       the [190]TrueSkill ranking system that is an extension of
       [191]Glickman's system to multi-player and multi-team games.

[[192]edit] Elo ratings in other games

   National [193]Scrabble organizations compute normally-distributed Elo
   ratings except in the [194]United Kingdom, where a different system is
   used. The North American [195]National Scrabble Association has the
   largest rated population, numbering over 11,000 as of early 2006.
   [196]Lexulous also uses the Elo system.

   The popular [197]First Internet Backgammon Server calculates ratings
   based on a modified Elo system. New players are assigned a rating of
   1500, with the best humans and bots rating over 2000. The same formula
   has been adopted by several other backgammon sites, such as
   [198]Play65, [199]DailyGammon, [200]GoldToken and [201]VogClub (Vinco
   Online Games). Vog sets a new player's rating at 1600.

   In other sports, individuals maintain rankings based on the Elo
   algorithm. These are usually unofficial, not endorsed by the sport's
   governing body. The [202]World Football Elo Ratings rank national teams
   in men's [203]football (soccer). [204]Jeff Sagarin publishes team
   rankings for American [205]college [206]football and [207]basketball,
   with "Elo chess" being one of the two rankings he presents. In 2006,
   Elo ratings were adapted for [208]Major League Baseball teams by
   [209]Nate Silver of [210]Baseball Prospectus.^[211][14] Based on this
   adaptation, Baseball Prospectus also makes Elo-based [212]Monte Carlo
   simulations of the odds of whether teams will make the
   playoffs.^[213][15] Glenn O'Brien publishes team rankings for
   [214]Hopman Cup using several rating systems, including variants of the
   Elo rating system.^[215][16] One of the few Elo-based rankings endorsed
   by a sport's governing body is the [216]FIFA Women's World Rankings,
   based on a simplified version of the Elo algorithm, which [217]FIFA
   uses as its official ranking system for national teams in [218]women's
   football (soccer).

   In the strategy game [219]Tantrix an Elo-rating scored in a tournament
   changes the overall rating according to the ratio of the games played
   in the tournament and the overall game count. Every year passed,
   ratings are deweighted until they completely disappear taken over by
   the new ratings.^[220][17] In the strategy game [221]Arimaa an Elo-type
   rating system is used. In this rating system, however, there is a
   second parameter "rating uncertainty", which doubles as the
   K-factor.^[222][18]

   Various online roleplaying-games (MMORPGs) use Elo ratings for
   player-vs-player (PVP) rankings. In [223]Guild Wars, Elo ratings are
   used to record guild rating gained and lost through Guild versus Guild
   battles, which are two-team fights. The K-value, as of December 2006,
   is 30, but will change to 5 shortly into the year 2007. [224]Vendetta
   Online uses Elo ratings to rank the flight combat skill of players when
   they have agreed to a 1-on-1 duel. [225]World of Warcraft uses the Elo
   Rating system when teaming up and comparing Arena players.^[226][19]
   The game [227]Puzzle Pirates uses the ELO rating system as well to
   determine the standings in the various puzzles.

   Trading-card game manufacturers often use Elo ratings for their
   organized play efforts. The [228]DCI (formerly Duelists' Convocation
   International) uses Elo ratings for tournaments of [229]Magic: The
   Gathering and other games of [230]Wizards of the Coast. [231]Pokmon USA
   uses the Elo system to rank its TCG organised play competitors. Prizes
   for the top players in various regions include holidays and world
   championships invites. Similarly, [232]Decipher, Inc. used the Elo
   system for its ranked games such as [233]Star Trek Customizable Card
   Game and [234]Star Wars Customizable Card Game.

   [235]FoosballRankings.com has applied the Elo Rating System to the game
   of foosball by offering a free Elo ranking tool that can be used in
   [236]Foosball tournaments and leagues. The ranking tool can even be
   modified by the players so that they have more control over the math
   behind it.

   [237]WeeWar uses a modified Elo Rating System to rank the players of
   its online turn based strategy game. The only difference is that
   rankings are unaffected by a draw.

   [238]TotoScacco uses a modified Elo rating system to rank the players
   of its guess-the-results game, where one has to predict the results of
   top chess events.

   [239]Golden Tee Golf uses an ELO rating system. Generally, any rating
   of 3000 or higher, the player is considered one of the elite of the
   game. This player usually places top 3 in tournaments on a regular
   basis. A rating of 2900-2999, this player will generally score in the
   top 5 with top 3 finishes about 60% of the time. A rating between
   2750-2900, this player will score top 10 on a regular basis with a top
   5 finish 40-50% of the time and a top 3 finish 20% of the time. A
   rating of 2750 and below, the player will generally finish in the top
   20 on a regular basis, the top 10 on a 40%-50% basis, the top 5 on a
   15% basis and will finish in the top 3 on a 5% basis.
