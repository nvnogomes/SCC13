Dorothy Dunbar

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Dorothy Dunbar ([8]May 28, [9]1902 [10]October 23, [11]1992) was an
   [12]American [13]actress and [14]socialite, who appeared in [15]silent
   movies in the 1920s.

   Born in [16]Colorado Springs, [17]Colorado, she appeared on the
   [18]Broadway [19]stage as a child in The School Girl (1904).

   In 1924, Dunbar went to [20]Hollywood, where she starred in several
   [21]motion pictures, including her role as the heroine in [22]The
   Amateur Gentleman ([23]1926) opposite [24]Richard Barthelmess, which
   attracted considerable attention for her. She was also the fourth
   actress who played [25]Jane, starring in the [26]1927 version of the
   [27]Tarzan story, [28]Tarzan and the Golden Lion, opposite [29]James
   Pierce, who played the title role. Also in the cast was [30]Boris
   Karloff, who played a native named Owaza.

   Dunbar left the movies upon marrying her second husband, wealthy
   [31]Minneapolis society man [32]Thomas Bucklin Wells, II, who
   apparently acted in one movie himself, [33]Ain't Love Funny? released
   in 1927 by Film Booking Offices of America (FBO).

   She is said to have had seven husbands, including theatrical producer
   Maurice (divorced); Thomas Wells (married October 1926-his death);
   [34]South American millionaire Jaime De Garson (divorced 1931);
   [35]boxer/[36]actor [37]Max Baer (married [38]July 8, [39]1931-divorced
   1933); portrait painter Tino Costa (married 1936 -annulled 1937); and
   Russell Lawson.

   She and Lawson had two sons, Richard and Russell.

   When Dunbar was preparing to divorce Tommy Wells, she received a cable
   from him to come to [40]Paris, where he was dying. She rushed to his
   bedside in the [41]French capital and forgave him. He died in her arms,
   having succumbed to [42]drug addiction. She received a $2,500 monthly
   income from his estate. She divorced De Garson, whom she married in
   [43]London, to marry Baer.

   She later styled herself as Dorothy Dunbar Wells. In 1936, she
   completed a book of [44]poetry, but had not found enough nerve to send
   it to a publisher. She had long decided movies were behind her.

   Dunbar asked that her marriage to French husband Costa be annulled
   because he was "temperamental and cold." In December 1937, she sued
   family members of her former husband, Wells, seeking $270,000 in trusts
   from his estate, because she said they had misrepresented certain
   papers they gave her to sign after his death. They told her, she said,
   the documents were to make certain the trusts were held for her, but
   she learned later the papers were actually waivers of her interest in
   the trusts.

   After marrying Lawson, her seventh husband, Dunbar went by the name
   Dorothy Wells Lawson. She played bridge and golf, and won some
   trophies.

   Dorothy Dunbar died at age ninety in [45]Seattle, Washington.
