   [43]Education in the [44]Philippines has similar features to that of
   the [45]United States.

   Filipino children enter public school at about age four, starting from
   [46]Nursery up to [47]Kindergarten. At about seven years of age,
   children enter a primary school (6 to 7 years). This is followed by
   secondary school (4 years). Students then sit for the College Entrance
   Examinations (CEE), after which they enter collegiate school (3 to 5
   years). Other types of schools do exist, such as [48]Private schools,
   [49]Preparatory schools, [50]International schools, [51]Laboratory High
   Schools and [52]Science High Schools. Also, several nationalities, such
   as the [53]Chinese, [54]British, [55]Americans, and the [56]Japanese
   also have their own schools.

   The school year in the Philippines starts in June of one year and ends
   in March of the next, with a two-month summer break for April and May,
   one week of semestral break (the last week of October), and a week or
   two of Christmas break.

   In 2005, the Philippines spent only about [57]US$138 per pupil compared
   to [58]US$1,582 in [59]Singapore, [60]US$3,728 in [61]Japan, and
   [62]US$852 in [63]Thailand.^[64][1]

[[92]edit] History and development

[[93]edit] Earlier times

   Further information: [94]Ancient Philippine scripts

   As early as in pre-Spanish times, education was informal, unstructured,
   and devoid of methods. Children were provided more vocational training
   and less academics (3 Rs) by their parents and in the houses of tribal
   tutors.

[[95]edit] Spanish period

   Major changes in education system happened during the Spanish
   colonization. The tribal tutors were replaced by the Spanish
   Missionaries. Education was religion-oriented. It was for the elite,
   especially in the early years of Spanish colonization. Access to
   education by the Filipinos was later liberalized through the enactment
   of the Educational Decree of 1863 which provided for the establishment
   of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town under
   the responsibility of the municipal government; and the establishment
   of a normal school for male teachers under the supervision of the
   [96]Jesuits. Primary instruction was free and the teaching of
   [97]Spanish was compulsory. Education during that period was
   inadequate, suppressed, and controlled. By 1898, enrollment in schools
   at all levels exceeded 200,000 students.^[98][2]

[[99]edit] First Republic

   The defeat of Spain by American forces paved the way for Aguinaldo's
   Republic under a Revolutionary Government. The schools maintained by
   Spain for more than three centuries were closed for the time being but
   were reopened on [100]August 29, [101]1898 by the Secretary of
   Interior. The Burgos Institute in Malolos, the Military Academy of
   Malolos, and the Literary University of the Philippines were
   established. A system of free and compulsory elementary education was
   established by the [102]Malolos Constitution.

[[103]edit] American period

          Main article: [104]Philippines education during American rule

   Further information: [105]Thomasites

   An adequate secularized and free public school system during the first
   decade of American rule was established upon the recommendation of the
   [106]Schurman Commission. Free primary instruction that trained the
   people for the duties of citizenship and avocation was enforced by the
   [107]Taft Commission per instructions of [108]President McKinley.
   Chaplains and non-commissioned officers were assigned to teach using
   English as the medium of instruction.

   A highly centralized public school system was installed in [109]1901 by
   the [110]Philippine Commission by virtue of Act No. 74. The
   implementation of this Act created a heavy shortage of teachers so the
   Philippine Commission authorized the Secretary of Public Instruction to
   bring to the Philippines more than 1,000 teachers from the [111]United
   States called the [112]Thomasites between 1901 to 1902. These teachers
   were scattered throughout the islands to establish barangay
   schools.^[113][2]

   The high school system supported by provincial governments, special
   educational institutions, school of arts and trades, an agricultural
   school, and commerce and marine institutes were established in 1902 by
   the Philippine Commission. In [114]1908, the Philippine Legislature
   approved Act No. 1870 which created the [115]University of the
   Philippines. Eventually, by virtue of the Reorganization Act of 1916,
   the Filipinization of all department secretaries except the Secretary
   of Public Instruction was sustained.^[116][3]

   Two decades later, enrollment in elemetary schools was about 1 million
   from a total of 150,000 students in 1901.^[117][2]

[[118]edit] Japanese occupation

   Japanese educational policies were embodied in Military Order No. 2 in
   [119]1942. The Philippine Executive Commission established the
   Commission of Education, Health and Public Welfare and schools were
   reopened in June 1942. On [120]October 14, [121]1943, the Japanese-
   sponsored Republic created the Ministry of Education. Under the
   Japanese regime, the teaching of [122]Tagalog, Philippine History, and
   Character Education was reserved for Filipinos. Love for work and
   dignity of labor was emphasized. On [123]February 27, [124]1945, the
   Department of Instruction was made part of the Department of Public
   Instruction.

[[125]edit] After World War II

   In 1947, by virtue of Executive Order No. 94, the Department of
   Instruction was changed to Department of Education. During this period,
   the regulation and supervision of public and private schools belonged
   to the Bureau of Public and Private Schools.

[[126]edit] Marcos era

   In 1972, the Department of Education became the Department of Education
   and Culture by Proclamation 1081.

   Following a referendum of all barangays in the Philippines from 10-15
   January 1973, on 17 January 1973 President Marcos ratified the 1973
   Constitution by Proclamation 1102. The 1973 Constitution set out the
   three fundamental aims of education in the Philippines, to:
     * foster love of country;
     * teach the duties of citizenship; and
     * develop moral character, self discipline, and scientific,
       technological and vocational efficiency..^[127][4]

   On 24 September 1972, by PD No 1, the Department of Education, Culture
   and Sports was decentralized with decision-making shared among thirteen
   regional offices.^[128][5]

   The Education Act of 1982 provided for an integrated system of
   education covering both formal and non-formal education at all levels.
   Section 29 of the Act sought to upgrade education institutions'
   standards to achieve quality education, through voluntary accreditation
   for schools, colleges, and universities. Sections 16 & 17 upgraded the
   obligations and qualifications required for teachers and
   administrators. Section 41 provided for government financial assistance
   to private schools.^[129][6] The Act also created the Ministry of
   Education, Culture and Sports.

   In 1978, by PD No 1397, the Department of Education and Culture became
   the Ministry of Education and Culture.

[[130]edit] Fifth Republic

   On 2 February 1987, a new Constitution for the Philippines was
   ratified. Secdtion 3, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution contains the
   10 fundamental aims of education in the Philippines.^[131][7]

   In 1987 by virtue of Executive Order No. 117, the Ministry of
   Education, Culture and Sports, became the Department of Education,
   Culture and Sports . The structure of DECS as embodied in EO No. 117
   remained practically unchanged until 1994.

   On 26 May 1988 Congress enacted RA 6655 which made free public
   secondary education to beome a reality.^[132][8]

   On 3 February 1992, Congress enacted RA 7323 which provided that
   students aged 15 to 25 may be employed during summer or Christmas
   vacation with a salary not lower than the minimum wage. 60% of the wage
   is to be paid by the employer and 40% by the government.^[133][9]

   The Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) report of 1991
   recommended the division of DECS into three parts. On 18 May 1994,
   Congress passed RA 7722 creating the [134]Commission on Higher
   Education (CHED), which assumed the functions of the Bureau of Higher
   Education, and supervises tertiary degree programs. On 25 August 1994,
   Congress passed RA 7796 creating the [135]Technical Education and
   Skills Development Authority (TESDA), which absorbed the Bureau of
   Technical-Vocational Education plus the National Manpower and Youth
   Council, and supervises non-degree technical-vocational programs. DECS
   retained responsibility for all elementary and secondary
   education.^[136][10] This threefold division became known as the
   trifocal system of education in the Philippines.

                           Department of Education

   Technical Education and Skills Development Authority

   Commission on Higher Education

   In August 2001, Republic Act 9155, otherwise called the Governance of
   Basic Education Act, was passed transforming the name of the Department
   of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) to the Department of Education
   (DepEd) and redefining the role of field offices (regional offices,
   division offices, district offices and schools). RA 9155 provides the
   overall framework for (i) school head empowerment by strengthening
   their leadership roles and (ii) school-based management within the
   context of transparency and local accountability. The goal of basic
   education is to provide the school age population and young adults with
   skills, knowledge, and values to become caring, self-reliant,
   productive and patriotic citizens.^[137][3]

   In January of 2009, DepEd signed a memorandum of agreement with the
   [138]United States Agency for International Development to seal $86
   million assistance to Philippine education, particularly the access to
   quality education in the [139]Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
   (ARMM), and the Western and Central [140]Mindanao regions.^[141][11]

[[142]edit] Primary school

   Primary school is also called Elementary school. It consists of six
   levels, with some schools adding an additional level (level 7). The
   levels are grouped into two primary subdivisions, Primary-level, which
   includes the first three levels, and Intermediate-level, which includes
   the last three levels.

   Primary education in the Philippines covers a wide curriculum. The core
   subjects (major subjects) include Mathematics, Sciences, English,
   Filipino (the Filipino language), and Makabayan (Social Studies,
   Livelihood Education, Values). Other subjects include Music, Arts, and
   Physical Education. Starting at the third level, Science becomes an
   integral part of the core subjects. On December 2007, [143]Philippine
   president [144]Gloria Macapagal Arroyo announced that [145]Spanish is
   to make a return as a mandatory subject in all Filipino schools
   starting in 2008.^[146][12]^[147][13] In private schools, the subjects
   include Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, Basic Computer,
   Filipino, Music, Arts and Technology, Home Economics, Health, Physical
   Education, and in Catholic schools, Religion or Christian Living.
   International schools and Chinese schools have additional subjects,
   especially in their language and culture.

   The teaching medium in the vast majority of all local schools is
   English. Filipino is considered only as a second language, and is used
   only in the Makabayan, and Filipino subjects. Outside of [148]Manila,
   other languages such as [149]Cebuano, [150]Bicolano, and [151]Waray,
   are also used in the teaching of Makabayan. International schools
   generally use English in all subjects. Chinese schools add two language
   subjects, such as [152]Min Nan Chinese and [153]Mandarin Chinese. A few
   private schools mainly catering to the elite include [154]Spanish in
   their curriculum. Meanwhile, [155]Arabic is used in Islamic schools.
   All primary-level students generally graduate with a knowledge of two
   or three languages.

   Primary students traditionally sit for the National Elementary
   Achievement Test (NEAT) administered by the [156]Department of
   Education, Culture and Sports (DECS). It was intended as a measure of a
   school's competence, and not as a predictor of student aptitude or
   success in Secondary school. Hence, the scores obtained by the student
   in the NEAT is not used as a basis in his or her admission into
   Secondary school. During 2004, when DECS was officially converted into
   the Department of Education (DepEd), and also, as a result of some
   reorganization, the NEAT was abolished. As of 2006, only private
   schools have entrance examinations for Secondary school.

   The National Elementary Achievement Test (NEAT) was changed to National
   Achievement Test (NAT) by the Department of Education (DepEd). Both the
   public and private elementary schools take this exam to measure a
   school's competency

[[157]edit] Secondary school

   Secondary education in the Philippines is largely based on the American
   schooling system. It consists of four levels. Secondary schooling is
   compartmentalized, meaning, each level focuses on a particular 'theme
   or content'. Secondary school is often called simply as 'High school',
   and as such, this will be the prevailing word in this section.

   The first year of High school includes five core subjects, namely,
   Algebra I, Integrated Science, English I, Filipino I, and Philippine
   History I. The second year of High school includes Algebra II, Biology,
   English II, Filipino II, and Asian History. The third year of High
   school includes Geometry, Chemistry, American Literature, Filipino III,
   and World History and Geography, and the fourth year of High school has
   Calculus, Trigonometry, Physics, World Literature, Filipino IV, and
   Economics. Other minor subjects include Health, Advanced Computer,
   Music, Arts, Technology and Home Economics, and Physical Education.

   In exclusive schools, various languages are offered as Electives,
   together with Computer programming, Literary writing, as well as other
   subjects. Chinese schools add language and cultural subjects.
   Preparatory schools usually add some Business and Accountancy courses,
   while Science high schools have Biology, Chemistry, ad Physics on every
   level.

   Secondary students traditionally sit for the National Secondary
   Achievement Test (NSAT), which is originally tailored as a counterpart
   of the American [158]SAT, and is administered by the [159]Department of
   Education (DepEd). Like its primary school counterpart, it was
   eventually phased-out after major reorganizations in the said
   department. As of now, there is no government-sponsored entrance
   examination for Tertiary schools, and all schools, public or private,
   administer their own College Entrance Examinations (CEE).

   After finishing secondary education, students have a choice of either
   continuing their education by taking two or three years of vocational
   courses, or going to college or university.

[[162]edit] Technical and Vocational School

   Technical/ Vocational school is school offering courses practically to
   enhance skills. Schools and their curriculum were accredited and
   approved by TESDA. They offer short program or two year - course on
   technology courses like automotive technology, electronic technology,
   nursing aide, hotel and restaurant management, computer technology,
   drafting ,etc. Upon graduation of these courses, students take a
   licensure examination from TESDA to obtain a certificate or diploma.

   Tertiary schooling in the Philippines is more cosmopolitan, with
   thousands of international students enrolling here, the vast majority
   of which come from [171]United States, [172]South Korea, [173]India,
   [174]Pakistan, and other [175]European countries like [176]Sweden and
   [177]Italy. Most Korean students are transients, studying for the first
   two or three years in the Philippines to have a working knowledge of
   English, and then transferring abroad to the [178]United States for
   degrees, but many still complete their tertiary education in the
   country.

[[179]edit] Classification

   Tertiary schools in the Philippines are either [180]colleges or
   [181]universities, and they are generally classified either as
   [182]public or [183]private. Colleges are tertiary institutions that
   typically offer one or a few specialized courses, for example, in the
   sciences or in liberal arts, whereas Universities are tertiary
   institutions housing several constituent colleges or institutes, each
   offering academic degree programs of a particular type (i.e., college
   of commerce, college of law, college of dentistry, college of
   education, etc.).^[[184]citation needed]

[[185]edit] Public tertiary schools

   Public universities are all non-sectarian entities, and are further
   classified as [186]State University and College (SUC) or [187]Local
   College and University (LCU)."^[[188]citation needed] SUCs are fully
   funded by the national government as determined by the [189]Philippine
   Congress. The [190]University of the Philippines, being the "national
   university,"^[191][14]^[192][15] enjoys the biggest chunk of the budget
   among the 456 state colleges and universities. LCUs, on the other hand,
   are run by [193]local government units. The [194]Pamantasan ng Lungsod
   ng Maynila is first and largest among the LCUs.^[195][16]

[[196]edit] Private tertiary schools

   Private colleges and universities may either be "[197]sectarian" or
   "[198]non-sectarian" entities. Most private schools are Catholic like
   [199]Adamson University (Vincentian), the [200]Ateneo de Manila
   University (Jesuit), [201]De La Salle University (Christian Brothers),
   [202]Don Bosco Technical College (Salesian), and the [203]University of
   Santo Tomas (Dominican). However, there are also non-Catholic
   institutions such as [204]Silliman University (Protestant),
   [205]Trinity University of Asia (Anglican), and [206]New Era University
   (Iglesia Ni Cristo). Non-sectarian private schools, on the other hand,
   are corporations licensed by the [207]Securities and Exchange
   Commission. Some of them are also registered on the [208]Philippine
   Stock Exchange.^[209][17]

[[210]edit] Accreditation

   Most tertiary institutions, also called higher education institutions
   are licensed, controlled, and supervised by the [211]Commission on
   Higher Education of the Philippines. Records from CHED showed that the
   country has 1,380 private and state-run colleges and universities with
   about 2.46 million students as of 2005.^[212][18]

   Voluntary accreditation of all institutions is subject to the policies
   of the Commission on Higher Education. Volunteer accreditating agencies
   in the private sector such as the [213]Philippine Accrediting
   Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU), the
   Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities' Commission On
   Accreditation (PACUCOA), and the Association of Christian Schools,
   Colleges and Universities Accrediting Association Inc. (ACSCU-AAI)
   operate under the umbrella of the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of
   the Philippines (FAAP), which itself is the organization tapped by
   CHED.^[214][19] Most of the institutions accredited by these agencies
   are private institutions.

   On the other hand, the government-supported institutions have banded
   themselves to a National Network of Quality Assurance Agencies (NNQAA)
   composed of the Accrediting Association of Chartered Colleges and
   Universities of the Philippines (AACCUP) and the Association of Local
   Colleges and Universities-Commission On Accreditation (ALCU-COA).
   AACCUP is the only active member of the International Network of
   Quality Assurance Agencies for Higher Education, (INQAAHE) and remains
   the only accrediting agency in the country which sits at the Board on
   the Asia Pacific Quality Network.^[215][19]

   Under CHED's Revised Policies and Guidelines on Voluntary Accreditation
   in Aid of Quality and Excellence and Higher Education, there are four
   levels of accreditation PAASCU in the private sector, with Level IV
   being the highest.^[216][20] There are only two private universities
   which have been granted this status by the PAASCU (working for FAAP),
   namely the [217]Ateneo de Manila
   University^[218][21]^[219][22]^[220][23] and the [221]De La Salle
   University^[222][24].

[[223]edit] Autonomy and Deregulation

   In an effort to rationalize its supervision of institutions of higher
   learning, CHED has also prescribed guidelines for granting privileges
   of autonomy and deregulation to certain schools. According to the
   guidelines, the general criteria examined by CHED are an institution's
   "long tradition of integrity and untarnished reputation," "commitment
   to excellence," and "sustainability and viability of operations."
   ^[224][25]

[[225]edit] Autonomous status

   Autonomous status allows universities to design their own curricula,
   offer new programs and put up branches or satellite campuses without
   having to secure permits, confer honorary degrees, and carry out
   operations without much interference from CHED.^[226][26]

   The following schools have been granted autonomous status:^[227][27]

[[267]edit] Rankings and league tables

   There are no set methods for ranking institutions in the Philippines.
   Aside from comparisons in terms of accreditation, autonomy, and centers
   of excellence awarded by the [268]Commission on Higher Education
   (CHED), there are attempts to rank schools based on performance in
   [269]board exams conducted by the [270]Professional Regulation
   Commission (PRC). The PRC and CHED sometimes publish reports on these
   results.

   In 2007, a report by the PRC and CHED covering a ten-year period
   (1992-2001)^[271][28] identified the [272]University of the
   Philippines, Diliman, [273]University of the Philippines, Los Baos, and
   [274]University of the Philippines, Manila as the top three performing
   schools based on PRC exams. They were followed by [275]Silliman
   University (4th), the [276]Ateneo de Davao University (5th), the
   [277]Ateneo de Manila University (6th), the [278]University of Santo
   Tomas (7th), [279]Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of
   Technology (8th), [280]Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (9th), and
   [281]St. Louis University (10th).^[282][29]

   Internationally, the [283]Ateneo de Manila University, [284]De La Salle
   University, the [285]University of the Philippines, and the
   [286]University of Santo Tomas are the only Philippine universities
   that had been included in league tables and surveys such as in the
   now-defunct [287]Asiaweek university rankings (which last ranked
   universities in 1999 and 2000),^[288][30]^[289][31], and the
   [290]THES-QS World University Rankings in 2005, 2006, and
   2008.^[291][32] In the 2007 THES-QS rankings, only UP and the Ateneo
   remained in the THES-QS rankings' top 500.^[292][26]^[293][33] In 2008,
   Ateneo, La Salle, UST and UP once again placed in the rankings, with
   the Ateneo ranked 254th in the world, UP at 276th while the University
   of Santo Tomas, and De La Salle University both placed in the Top
   401-500 category^[294][34] Ateneo and UP were also ranked among the top
   100 universities worldwide in the field of the arts and
   humanities.^[295][35] The THES-QS rankings are mainly based on
   [296]peer review survey,^[297][36] while the Asiaweek rankings were
   measured on the university's endowment and resources.^[298][37]

   There are other university rankings based on different methodologies
   and criteria. In the [299]Webometrics Ranking of World Universities by
   a Spanish research body, which measures a universitys Internet presence
   and the volume of research output freely accessible online, has UP and
   La Salle dominating other local universities. On the other hand, in the
   [300]Shanghai Jiao Tong University [301]Academic Ranking of World
   Universities, which is based on [302]Nobel Prize winners, [303]Fields
   medals for mathematicians, highly cited researchers, or articles in
   Nature or Science; and, the [304]cole des Mines de Paris rankings,
   which is according to the number of alumni who are the CEOs of the
   [305]Fortune 500 companies, do not have Philippine universities in the
   top 500.^[306][26]

[[307]edit] Views of rankings

   Rankings such as the THES-QS have been received with mixed reactions.
   In 2006, [308]Ang Pamantasan, the official student paper of Pamantasan
   ng Lungsod ng Maynila, published the university's criticism on the
   rankings, saying that the THES-QS criteria do not apply to the unique
   landscape of each participating universities, and that such rankings
   say nothing or very little about whether students are actually learning
   at particular colleges or universities.^[309][38] On the same year, the
   University of the Philippines, through its University President
   Emerlinda Romn, expressed that it does not want to participate in the
   THES-QS Ranking, but was included in 2007 with an incomplete academic
   profile.^[310][39]

   Two years later, UP questioned the validity of the 2008 THES-QS
   rankings, claiming that the methodology used was "problematic," and
   cited the [311]Ranking Systems for Universities and Institutions: A
   Critical Appraisal, which found out that the [312]Times simply asks
   190,000 experts to list what they regard as the top 30 universities in
   their field of expertise without providing input data on any
   performance indicators, as one of the bases for rejecting the said
   survey.^[313][40] Furthermore, the UP said that THES-QS refused to
   divulge how and where the data were taken from,^[314][41] and instead,
   advised the university to advertise at the THES-QS website for [315]US$
   48,930 publicity package.^[316][40] CHED Chairperson Emmanuel Angeles,
   on the other hand, commended all four Philippine universities that made
   it to the list. He also suggested that Philippine schools would get
   better in the future THES-QS rankings if they choose to advertise in
   the THES-QS publications and when budgetary allocations for faculty and
   researchers, particulary at UP, would become better in the coming
   years.^[317][41]

[[318]edit] Chinese schools

   Chinese schools add two additional subjects to the core curriculum,
   Ha-g(Chinese grammar and literature) and Ting-hp(Chinese
   communication). Some add two more, namely, Chinese History and Chinese
   Culture. Still, other Chinese schools called cultural schools, offer
   Confucian classics and Chinese history as part of their curriculum.
   Notable Chinese schools include Makati Hope Christian School located
   along Don Chino Roces Avenue (formerly known as Pasong Tamo Extension)
   in Makati; [319]Saint Jude Catholic School and St. Peter the Apostle
   School,Chinese [320]Catholic schools near Malacaang; [321]Philippine
   Cultural High School, [322]Chiang Kai Shek College, [323]St. Stephen's
   High School,Hope Christian High School and Uno High School,secondary
   and tertiary institutions in Binondo; Manila; Jubilee Christian
   Academy, Grace Christian High School, Immaculate Conception Academy,
   [324]Xavier School, primary and secondary schools in San Juan, Metro
   Manila; and [325]Leyte Progressive High School in [326]Tacloban.

[[327]edit] Islamic schools

   In 2004, the Department of Education adopted DO 51 putting in place the
   teaching of Arabic Language and Islamic Values for (mainly) Muslim
   children in the public schools. The same order authorized the
   implementation of so-called Standard Madrasah Curriculum (SMC) in the
   private madaris (Arabic for schools, the singular form is Madrasah).

   While there has been recognized Islamic schools, i.e. Ibn Siena
   Integrated School (Marawi), Sarang Bangun LC (Zamboanga) and SMIE
   (Jolo), their Islamic studies varies.With the DepEd-authorized SMC, the
   subject offering is uniform across these private Madaris.

   Since 2005, the AusAID-funded DepEd-project [328]Basic Education
   Assistance for Mindanao (BEAM) has assisted a group of private madaris
   seeking government permit to operate (PTO) and implement the SMC. To
   date, there are 30 of these private madaris scattered throughout
   Regions XI, XII and the ARMM.

   The SMC is a combination of the RBEC subjects (English , Filipino,
   Science, Math and Makabayan) and the teaching of Arabic and Islamic
   studies subjects.
     * Region XI - Pilot Integrated Madrasah (Davao Oriental),
       [329]Al-Munawwara Islamic School (Davao City)

     * Region XII - WAMY Academy (Gensan), Kumayl LC (Koronadal), Darul
       Uloom (Tamontaka, Cotabato City), Al-Nahdah Academy (Campo Muslim,
       Cotabato City), SKC Madrasah Abubakar (Bagua, Cotabato City) and
       Sultan Kudarat Academy (Sinsuat Ave, Cotabato City)

     * ARMM (Marawi City) - Jamiato Janoubel Filibbien, Jamiato Marawi
       al-Islamia, Khadijah Pilot Madrasah, Princess Jawaher IS

     * ARMM (Lanao del Sur) - Ma'had Montashir (Masiu), Ma'had Aziziah and
       Sha'rawi LC (Butig), Madrasah Falah al-Khayrie (Lumba Bayabao),
       Ma'had Lanao (Malabang), As-Salihein Integrated School
       (Tamparan),others.

     * ARMM (Maguindanao Valley) - Ibn Taymiyyah Academy (Shariff
       Kabunsuan), Ma'had Maguindanao (Ampatuan), Madrasah Datu Tahir
       (Mamasapano), Ma'had Rahmanie Al-Islamie (Sharif Aguak). Through
       the philanthopy of Governor Datu Andal Ampatuan and his family,
       Ma'had Rahmanie is being re-designed and re-constructed to position
       it to become the premier institution of integrated learning in the
       ARMM. When the whole infrastructure development is done, it will be
       renamed Shariff Aguak Ibn Ampatuan Memorial Academy.

     * ARMM (Island Provinces) - Ma'had Da'wah (Lamitan City), Kulliyato
       Talipao (Talipao, Sulu), CHILD Madrasah (Bongao, Tawi-Tawi). The
