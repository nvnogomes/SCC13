   E.M. Ward, The South Sea Bubble" (1846), a Hogarthian subject in the
   [9]Tate Gallery

   Edward Matthew Ward ([10]July 14, [11]1816 [12]January 15, [13]1879)
   was an [14]English [15]Victorian narrative painter best known for his
   murals in the [16]Palace of Westminster depicting episodes in British
   history from the [17]English Civil War to the [18]Glorious Revolution.

   Ward was born in [19]Pimlico, [20]England. As a student at the
   [21]Royal Academy of Arts Ward became a member of [22]The Clique, a
   group of painters led by [23]Richard Dadd. Like other members of the
   Clique Ward saw himself as a follower of [24]Hogarth and [25]Wilkie,
   considering their styles to be distinctly national in character. Many
   of his early paintings were set in the eighteenth century and were on
   Hogarthian subjects. He also painted episodes from seventeenth century
   history, influenced by the thinking of his friend, the historian
   [26]Thomas Babington Macaulay. He also painted subjects from the
   history of the [27]French Revolution.

   In the 1850s Ward came into conflict with the [28]Pre-Raphaelites,
   especially [29]Millais, whose style of art he considered to be
   un-British. Ward's painting of [30]Charlotte Corday being led to
   execution beat Millais's [31]Ophelia for a prize at Liverpool, leading
   to much debate at the time.

   Such historical paintings led to Ward's commission to paint eight
   scenes in the corridor leading into the [32]House of Commons. These
   were to depict parallel episodes on the [33]Royalist and
   [34]Parliamentary sides in the Civil War. Ward's paintings depict the
   opposed figures as if confronting one another across the corridor.

   Ward continued to paint Hogarthian versions of episodes from British
   history throughout the 1860s, notably Hogarth's Studio in 1739 (1863,
   [35]York City Art Gallery) the Antechamber at Whitehall During the
   Dying Moments of Charles II (1865, [36]Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool).
   In the 1870s he painted some modern-life genre subjects, but towards
   the end of the decade began to suffer painful illness and depression,
   resulting in his suicide in 1879.

   His wife [37]Henrietta Ward was also a painter. After her husband's
   death she became a successful art teacher. His son [38]Leslie Ward
   became a popular [39]caricaturist for the magazine [40]Vanity Fair
   under the nickname 'Spy'.
