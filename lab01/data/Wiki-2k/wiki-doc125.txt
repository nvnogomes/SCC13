[[49]edit] Overview

   The term silver dollar is often used for any large [50]white metal
   [51]coin issued by the [52]United States with a face value of one
   [53]dollar; although purists insist that a dollar is not silver unless
   it contains some of that metal. Gold and [54]gold-colored dollars have
   also been produced by the United States. The [55]Sacagawea and
   [56]Presidential dollars are usually referred to as golden, despite not
   containing any gold, as they are a golden color.

   Dollar coins have found little popular acceptance in circulation in the
   United States since the early 20th century, despite several attempts
   since 1971 to phase in a coin in place of the [57]one dollar bill. This
   contrasts with currencies of many other [58]developed countries, where
   denominations of similar value exist only in coin, such as the
   [59]Canadian [60]loonie and [61]toonie, [62]British [63]50 pence coin
   (as well as the [64]1 pound and [65]2 pound British coins, though the
   [66]Royal Bank of Scotland still maintains a 1 note), the 1 and 2
   [67]Australian Dollar coins, the 50 [68]New Taiwan dollar coin, 100 and
   500 [69]Japanese yen coin, Swiss 1, 2 and 5 [70]francs coin, [71]1 euro
   coin and [72]2 euro coin. These coins have largely succeeded because of
   a removal (or lack) of their corresponding paper issues, whereas the
   United States government has taken no action to remove the one-dollar
   bill, whether due to intensive lobbying by [73]a small but active
   [74]lobbying group or due to genuine consumer resistance.

[[75]edit] Early dollar coins (through 1803)

   Before the Revolutionary War, coins from many European nations
   circulated freely in the American colonies, as well as decimal coinage
   issued by the various colonies. Chief among these was the Spanish
   silver "dollar" coins (also called [76]pieces of eight or eight reales)
   minted in Mexico and other colonies with silver mined from Central and
   South American mines. These coins, along with others of similar size
   and value, were in use throughout the colonies and later the United
   States and were legal tender until 1857.

   In 1776, the Continental Congress authorized plans to produce a silver
   coin to prop up the rapidly failing [77]Continentalthe first attempt by
   the fledgling US at paper currency. Several examples were struck in
   brass, pewter, and silver, but a circulating coin was not produced, due
   in large part to the financial difficulties of running the
   Revolutionary War. The Continental Dollar bears a date of 1776, and
   while its true denomination is not known, it is generally the size of
   later dollars, and the name has stuck. The failure of the Continental
   exacerbated a distrust of paper money amongst both politicians and the
   populace at large. The letters of [78]Thomas Jefferson indicate that he
   wished the United States to eschew paper money and instead mint coins
   of similar perceived value and worth to those foreign coins circulating
   at the time.^[79][1]

   The [80]Coinage Act of 1792 authorized the production of dollar coins
   from silver. The [81]U.S. Mint produced silver dollar coins from 1794
   to 1803, then ceased regular production of silver dollars until 1836.
   The first silver dollars, precisely 1,758 of them, were coined on
   October 15, 1794 and were immediately delivered to Mint Director
   [82]David Rittenhouse for distribution to dignitaries as souvenirs.
   ^[83][2] Thereafter, until 1804, they were struck in varying
   quantities. There are two obverse designs: Flowing Hair (1794-1795) and
   Draped Bust (1795-1804). There are also two reverse designs used for
   the Draped Bust variety: small eagle (1795-1798) and heraldic eagle
   (1798-1804). Original silver dollars from this period are highly prized
   by [84]coin collectors and are exceptionally valuable, and range from
   fairly common to incredibly rare. Due to the early practice of hand
   engraving each die, there are dozens of varieties known for all dates
   between 1795-1803. As the earliest examples of the largest circulating
   coins ever struck by the United States Mint, they bear a certain
   mystique that has enthralled collectors for two centuries.

   It is also one of only two denominations (the other being the cent)
   minted in every year from its inception during the first decade of mint
   operation. However, the order was given by President [85]Thomas
   Jefferson to halt silver dollar production due to the continued
   exportation of US dollars. The Spanish 8 Reale, which was slightly
   heavier than the US dollar, nonetheless traded at a 1-to-1 ratio. So US
   dollars went to the Caribbean, were traded for heavier 8 Reales, and
   those were then brought back to the US, where they would be recoined
   for free into more US dollars, and the difference in silver was kept by
   the exporter. This ensured that no dollars would circulate in the US,
   but would instead be exported for their heavier counterparts overseas,
   leaving little but old, foreign money to circulate in the United States
   in a process known as [86]Gresham's Law.

   This highlights a dilemma that would continue to haunt the United
   States mint well into the 20th century: if a coin was too heavy in
   precious metal, it would simply be melted and sold for more as bullion.
   If it was too light, it would be exported for heavier weight coins from
   foreign governments. Maintaining this precarious balance is eventually
   what led to the abandonment of gold as specie worldwide in the 1930s
   and 40's, and silver rapidly following suit by the late 1960s and early
   1970s.

          Main article: [93]1804 silver dollar

   The [94]1804 silver dollar ^[95][3]is one of the rarest and most famous
   coins in the world. Its creation was the result of a simple bookkeeping
   error, but its status as the king of coins has been established for
   nearly a century and a half. The silver dollars reported by the mint as
   being struck in 1804 were actually dated 1803 (die steel being very
   expensive in the early 1800s, dies were used until they were no longer
   in working condition. This is why many early US coins exhibit all kinds
   of die cracks, occlusions, cuds, clash marks, and other late state die
   wear. Dies were used until they literally fell apart. Nearly every coin
   the US struck from 1793 to 1825 has an example that was struck in a
   year other than that which it bears.) No dollars bearing the date 1804
   were ever struck in 1804, though this was unknown to mint officials at
   the time the 1804 dollar came to be.

   The 1804 silver dollar was actually produced in 1834, when the [96]U.S.
   Department of State decided to produce a set of U.S. coins to be used
   as gifts to rulers in [97]Asia in exchange for trade advantages. Since
   1804 was the last recorded year of mintage for both the dollar and $10
   Eagle, it was decided that the set would contain examples of those
   coins dated 1804, as well as the other denominations currently being
   produced. Mint officials, not realizing that the 19,000+ dollars
   recorded as being produced in 1804 were all dated 1803, proceeded to
   make new dies dated 1804. Little did they know the stunning rarity they
   were creating. Only 15 silver dollars with the date of 1804 are known
   to exist; in 1999, one of them sold at [98]auction for more than $4
   million. There are 8 Class I dollars, struck in 1834 for the
   aforementioned sets, 1 Class II dollar, struck over an 1857 Swiss
   Shooting Thaler (and now residing in the US Coin Collection at the
   Smithsonian Institution), and 6 Class III dollars, struck
   surreptitiously sometime between 1858 and 1860 to meet collector demand
   for the coin.

[[99]edit] Seated Liberty dollar (18361873)

          Main article: [100]Seated Liberty dollar

   Seated Liberty Dollars were introduced in 1840 and were minted in
   larger quantities than the sparsely minted Gobrecht Dollar that
   preceded it. The dollars were used in general circulation until 1853.
   In 1853, the value of the silver was more than the face value of the
   coin. The coin was continued to be minted mainly as a trade coin to be
   used in the Orient. This ended in 1870 when the price of silver lowered
   allowing the dollars to be placed back in normal circulation.

   Each coin is composed of 0.77344 troy oz of silver. They were minted at
   Philadelphia, New Orleans, Carson City, and San Francisco.

[[101]edit] Gold dollar coins (18491889)

          Main article: [102]Gold dollar

   The gold dollar was a United States dollar coin produced from 1849 to
   1889. Composed of 90% pure gold, it was the smallest denomination of
   gold currency ever produced by the United States federal government.
   When the US system of coinage was originally designed there had been no
   plans for a gold dollar coin, but in the late 1840s, two gold rushes
   later, Congress was looking to expand the use of gold in the countrys
   currency.[1][2] The gold dollar was authorized by the Act of March 3,
   1849, and the Liberty Head type began circulating soon afterward.[3]
   Because of the high value of gold, the gold dollar is the smallest coin
   in the history of US coinage.

[[103]edit] Trade Dollar (18731885)

          Main article: [104]Trade Dollar (United States coin)

   The Trade Dollar was produced in response to other Western powers, such
   as Great Britain, Spain, France, and particularly Mexico, circulating
   large, crown size silver coins in Asia. Trade Dollars had a slightly
   higher silver content than the regular circulation Seated Liberty
   Dollars and Morgan Dollars, to compete with these foreign trade coins.
   Most Trade Dollars ended up in Asia during their first two years of
   production, where they were very successful. Many of them exhibit
   chopmarks which are counterstamps from Asian merchants to verify the
   authenticity of the coins. Many trade coins of the western powers and
   large silver coins from China, Korea, and Japan also bear these
   chopmarks. While most chopmarked coins are generally worth less than
   those without, some of the more fascinating chopmarks can actually give
   the coin a modest premium.

   Trade Dollars did not circulate in the United States initially, but
   were legal tender for up to $5. Things changed, however, in 1876, when
   the price of silver spiraled downward as western producers dumped
   silver on the market, making the Trade Dollar worth more at face value
   than its silver content. That resulted in Trade Dollars pouring back
   into the United States, as they were bought for as little as the
   equivalent of 80 US cents in Asia, and were then spent at $1 in the
   United States. This prompted Congress to revoke their legal tender
   status, and restrict their coinage to exportation demand only. However,
   this didn't stop unscrupulous persons from buying Trade Dollars at
   bullion value, and using them for payment as $1 to unsuspecting workers
   and merchants.

   Production of the Trade Dollar was officially halted for business
   strikes in 1878, and thereafter from 1879-1885, produced only as proof
   examples of the coin. The issues of 1884 and 1885 were produced
   surreptitiously, and were unknown to the collecting public until 1908.

   In February 1887, all non-mutilated outstanding Trade Dollars were made
   redeemable to the United States Treasury, and approximately 8 million
   of them were turned in.

   Collectors are warned that a large number of perfect copies, apparently
   made in China, have been made. Buying only from known dealers, or
   certified specimens, is highly recommended.

   The Morgan silver dollar

          Main article: [111]Morgan Dollar

   Morgan ^[112][4] silver dollars were minted between 1878 and 1921, with
   a notable break between 1905 and 1920. The 1921-dated coins are the
   most common, and there exists a substantial collector market for
   pristine, uncirculated specimens of the rarer dates and [113]mint
   marks. Morgan dollars are second only to [114]Lincoln Cents in
   collector popularity. The large size, design and inexpensive nature of
   most dates of the Morgan dollar makes them highly popular. The coin is
   named after [115]George T. Morgan, its designer. Some people collect
   Morgan dollars by "VAM" designation (named for Leroy C. Van Allen and
   A. George Mallis, who did extensive research on the die characteristics
   of this series.) The top 100 VAM varieties are highly collectible. As
   well, this is the most popular United States series collected by grade,
   with "finest known" being a very attractive selling point.

   The mint mark is found on the reverse below the wreath, above the 'O'
   in 'DOLLAR'.

   One of the keys to the series is the [116]proof-only 1895 (struck at
   the Philadelphia mint), which can sell for up to $100,000 in top
   condition. Since the rarity of the coin was not initially realized
   (there were 12,000 business strikes recorded, but these were later
   melted), and since the coins were available at the Mint for a modest
   premium above face value, circulated, or "impaired" specimens are
   known. Because no business strike exists for this date and mint, many
   collectors are forced to buy the proof, or settle for what is regarded
   as an incomplete date/mint collection. The rarest (by mintage) business
   strike Morgan is the 1893-S with a paltry 100,000 examples struck, and
   certainly not all examples survive. A top condition example (MS67 is
   currently the highest known) can bring nearly $1 Million at auction.
   Morgan dollars from the [117]Carson City mint ("CC" mintmark) are worth
   a premium. 1889-CC, while not the rarest Carson City dollar by mintage,
   is the rarest by surviving examples today, and is the most valuable
   Carson City dollar. Other rare dates include 1892-[118]S, 1893, 1893-O,
   1894, 1894-S, 1895-O, 1895-S, 1902-S, 1903-S, 1903-O, and 1904-S all
   worth $100 or more even in circulated (Fine-About Uncirculated)
   conditions. Several coins in the series, while quite common in
   circulated condition, are very rare in uncirculated conditions, and can
   command hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece. 1901 is such a coin,
   as is 1884-S. There is currently only a single known MS68 1884-S dollar
   and if sold at auction, that coin could easily bring
   $750,000-$1,000,000...for a "common" date coin.

   Many of the spectacular rarities of the series, both by grade and
   absolutely, can be attributed to the order to melt down 270 million
   silver dollars still on hand by the Pittman Act of 1918. Because of
   this, and subsequent melting, it is estimated that only 17% of all
   Morgan dollars minted still survive. However, that's still many
   millions of examples.

   Many examples exceed $100 in uncirculated condition, but the majority
   do not. A common date in uncirculated can normally be found for around
   $20, and often as little as $12 circulated and $16 uncirculated.

   High-grade Morgan dollars are generally considered "investor" coins.
   This is because the prices are very volatile, and the values for
   certified ("slabbed") pieces are set on well-established exchanges.

   The Peace silver dollar

          Main article: [125]Peace Dollar

   Introduced in December 1921, the Peace dollar ^[126][5] , designed by
   medalist [127]Anthony de Francisci, was promulgated to commemorate the
   signing of formal [128]peace treaties between the Allied forces and
   [129]Germany and [130]Austria. These treaties officially ended the
   Allies' [131]World War I hostilities with these two countries. In 1922
   the Mint made silver dollar production its top priority, causing other
   denominations to be produced sparingly if at all that year. Production
   ceased temporarily after 1928; original plans apparently called for
   only a one year suspension, but this was extended by the [132]Great
   Depression. Mintage resumed in 1934, but for only two years.

   In May 1965, 316,000+ Peace Dollars were minted, all at the [133]Denver
   Mint and dated 1964-D; however, plans for completing this coinage were
   abandoned, and most of those already minted were melted, with two known
   trial strike specimens being preserved (for assay purposes) until 1970,
   when they too were melted, and none released either for circulation or
   collection purposes. It is rumored that one or more pieces still exist,
   most notably any examples obtained by key members of Congress, the
   President, or mint officials. However, this coin, much like the
   [134]1933 $20 gold Double Eagle (aside from the "exception", sold in
   2002 for over $7 million), is illegal to own and would be subject to
   confiscation.

[[135]edit] Release of dollars by the US Treasury; the GSA sale

   Because of the size and weight of the dollar coins, they circulated
   minimally throughout their history, except in the West (especially at
   casinos in the early to mid 20th century, where they were commonly used
   both at the tables and at slot machines.) As a result, the coins were
   generally shipped to Washington and stored in the vaults of the US
   Treasury; at times these stores numbered into the hundreds of millions.

   They were very popular as Christmas gifts, however, and from the 1930s
   to the early 1960s, many bags were annually released to banks
   nationwide to be distributed as presents. In November 1962, during this
   annual distribution, it was discovered that there were some rare and
   valuable dates, still sealed in their original mint bags, all in
   uncirculated condition, among the millions of dollar coins still in the
   Treasury vaults. Collectors/investors/dealers lined up to purchase them
   in $1,000 bags, trading silver certificates for the coins. Before this
   event, the great rarity of the Morgan series was 1903-O, which was by
   far the most expensive of the entire set. It was discovered that there
   were millions of this specific date and mint in the Treasury vaults; an
   estimated 84% of the entire mintage sat in these bags, untouched for 60
   years, all in uncirculated condition. While still relatively expensive
   in circulated grades, uncirculated examples can be had for a modest
   amount over common dates.

   On March 25, 1964, the Secretary of the Treasury announced that Silver
   Certificates would no longer be redeemable for silver dollars.
   ^[136][6] Subsequently, another act of Congress dated June 24, 1967,
   provided that Silver Certificates could be exchanged for silver bullion
   for a period of one year, until June 24,1968. ^[137][7]

   Following this, the Treasury began to inventory its remaining stock of
   dollar coins, and found it had about 3,000 bags (3 million coins) still
   left, many of them Carson City mint dollars, which even then carried a
   premium. The coins were placed in special hard plastic holders and the
   General Services Administration (GSA) was given authorization to sell
   them to the public in a series of mail-bid sales. Five sales were
   conducted in 1973 and 1974, but sales were poor, and the results
   unspectacular. There was much complaining among the coin buying public,
   many stating that the United States Government should not be in the
   "coin business", especially considering that the government had spent
   little more than a dollar to mint and store each coin. After these
   sales, more than a million coins were still left unsold.

   These sat again until 1979-1980, where, amidst an extraordinarily
   volatile precious metals market, the remaining coins were sold under
   chaotic conditions. The GSA, having published minimum bids in November
   1979, announced on January 2, 1980, that those minimum bids were no
   longer valid, and that prospective bidders would have to "call in" to a
   toll free number to get current minimum bids. Then, on February 21, 13
   days after the bidding process officially began, the maximum number of
   coins per bidder was changed from 500 to 35. Many bidders, under these
   confusing conditions, ended up with no coins at all. Complaints again
   flooded in to Congress, but the damage had already been done, and the
   last silver dollars held by the United States Treasury were
   gone.^[138][8] ^[139][9] ^[140][10]

   Over the years, many of these GSA dollars have been broken out of their
   special holders for purposes of grading or otherwise, and now original,
   unbroken GSA dollars carry a small premium. Some third party grading
   companies have begun to grade coins still in their GSA holders, as a
   means of preservation, though this is not without controversy.

   The [149]Eisenhower clad dollar ([150]obverse).
   1975/1976 [151]Bicentennial [152]Commemorative coin (reverse).

   From 1971 to 1978, the U.S. Mint issued dollar coins with the obverse
   depicting [153]Dwight D. Eisenhower ^[154][12] and the reverse the
   insignia of the [155]Apollo 11 moon landing, both designed by Chief
   Engraver [156]Frank Gasparro. The [157]1976 Bicentennial
   [158]commemorative design, produced in 1975 and 1976, featured the
   [159]Liberty Bell and the Moon on the reverse (designed by Dennis R.
   Williams), while retaining the Eisenhower obverse. The Eisenhower
   dollars minted for general circulation contained no silver or gold, but
   were instead composed of the same copper-nickel clad composition used
   for the dime, quarter, and half dollar. This made the circulation coins
   extremely resistant to wear and, like the smaller denominations, they
   still retain a good deal of shine even when subject to mass usage. From
   1971 through 1976 the Mint also produced dollars composed of 40% silver
   aimed at the collector market.

   The coins were never very popular, primarily due to their large size
   and weight which made them inconvenient to carry and the fact that very
   few vending machines were designed to accept them. They saw the
   greatest use in casinos, and one-dollar tokens in United States casinos
   still approximate the size and weight of the coins. Prior to the
   withdrawal of the coins, which remain legal tender (and are often still
   available at banks, by request), many casinos did not strike their own
   tokens, but instead used the Eisenhower dollar.

   non-specific representations of [169]Liberty. [170]Spain's [171]Queen
   Isabella was portrayed along with [172]Christopher Columbus on the 1893
   [173]World's Columbian Exposition [174]commemorative half dollar, but
   it was not a circulating coin.) The Anthony dollars, like the
   Eisenhower dollars, were made from a copper-nickel clad. The 1981 coins
   were issued for collectors only, but occasionally still show up in
   circulation.

   Susan B. Anthony dollar coins were sometimes referred to as "Carter
   quarters" and "the J.C. Penny". (These were snide references to both
   the deterioration of the value of the dollar during [175]Jimmy Carter's
   term and the Anthony dollar's resemblance in size to the [176]quarter,
   often causing it to be mistakenly spent as such.) They were quickly
   discontinued, but were resurrected in 1999 when Treasury reserves were
   low, and the Sacagawea dollar was still a year away from
   production.^[177][13] While reserves of the coins were initially high,
   the coins were in demand to be used as change in vending machines, most
   often in transit systems and post offices.

   This dollar is commonly referred to in many states as a "Suzy" or
   "Susie"; another variation is to refer to the coin as a "Susan B" or
   "Susie/Suzy B".

[[178]edit] Sacagawea dollar (2000Present)

          Main article: [179]Sacagawea dollar

   Obverse of the Sacagawea Dollar
   Reverse of the Sacagawea Dollar, 2000-2008
   Reverse of the 2009 Sacagawea Dollar

   The [180]Sacagawea dollar was authorized by [181]Congress in 1997
   because the supply of Anthony dollars, in inventory since their last
   mintage in 1981, was soon expected to be depleted. Delays in ramping up
   Sacagawea dollar production led to a final 1999-dated mintage of Susan
   B. Anthony dollars. As predicted by [182]Coin Coalition representatives
   at Congressional hearings on the [183]United States $1 Coin Act of
   1997, the government's decision not to eliminate the [184]U.S. one
   dollar bill prevented the Sacagawea dollar from being widely
   circulated. While dollar coins are used infrequently in general
   commerce, they are used in place of tokens in some areas and are given
   as change in many [185]United States Postal Service stamp vending
   machines, creating a relatively small but significant demand.

   The obverse was designed by artist [186]Glenna Goodacre, using
   [187]Shoshone [188]Randy'L He-dow Teton as a model for
   Sacagawea.^[189][14]

   There are approximately 1 billion Sacagawea coins in circulation and
   about 250 million more in reserve. The United States Mint greatly
   reduced production of Sacagawea dollars after the 2001 minting, citing
   sufficient inventory. As of 2006, the dollar is still being minted for
   collectors, and is available in Uncirculated Rolls, Mint Sets, and
   Proof Sets, but has not been released for general circulation since
   2001.

   The Mint took great care to create the coin with the same size, weight,
   and [190]electromagnetic properties as the Anthony dollar, but with a
   golden color. Unlike most other coins in circulation, the selected
   alloy has a tendency to [191]tarnish quite severely in circulation, as
   is the case with most [192]brasses, resulting in a loss of the golden
   "patina"^[193][15]. While some consider the blackening an undesired
   quality, the Mint suggests the uneven tarnishing effect gives the the
   coins an "antique finish" that "accentuate[s] the profile and add[s] a
   dimension of depth to the depiction of Sacagawea and her
   child"^[194][15].

   As of 2007^[195][update], dollar coins are not widely encountered in
   commerce in the United States, except in vending machines for rides on
   [196]mass transit, some [197]pay and display machines, and [198]U.S.
   Postal Service stamp vending machines, which give the coins as change;
   and at some [199]casinos, where they are used in [200]slot machines.
   Most vending machines have been redesigned, however, to accept dollar
   coins for purchase over a quarter-dollar. The Sacagawea dollar has
   achieved popularity in [201]Ecuador, where the US dollar is [202]also
   the official currency.^[203][16]

[[204]edit] Native American series

   With the passage of the, [205]Native American $1 Coin Act,^[206][17] on
   [207]September 20, [208]2007, the U.S. Mint began designing a series of
   Sacagawea dollars with modified reverses to further commemorate "Native
   Americans and the important contributions made by Indian tribes and
   individual Native Americans to the development of the United States and
   the history of the United States." Four designs will be minted, each
   for one year from 2009 to 2012. The first Native American series coin
   was released in January 2009 and has a reverse that depicts a Native
   American woman sowing seeds of the "[209]Three Sisters", symbolizing
   the Indian tribes' contributions to [210]agriculture. Like the
   [211]Presidential Dollar, the year of issue, mint mark, and motto
   "[212]E Pluribus Unum" have be moved to the edge of the coin to allow
   more room for the design^[213][18]. Unlike the Presidential $1 coins
   from before 2009, "[214]In God We Trust" will remain on the obverse and
   the vacant space on the edge lettering will be taken up by thirteen
   [215]stars, symbolizing the [216]Thirteen Colonies. The act passed by
   Congress requires that 20% of the total dollar coins minted in any year
   during the [217]Presidential $1 Coin Program be Sacagawea dollars
   bearing the new design.

[[218]edit] Presidential Dollar Coin (2007present)

          Main article: [219]Presidential $1 Coin Program

   Obverse of the [220]George Washington (#1) coin
   Reverse of the coin

   In December 2005, Congress decided to create a new series of $1 coins
   which will honor the [221]former U.S. presidents. In 2007, Presidential
   coins of four different designs were produced. Another four designs
   will be produced each year, honoring the Presidents in order of
   service. ([222]Grover Cleveland will be on two coins, since he served
   two non-consecutive terms.) The Presidential $1 Coin Act is intended to
   create renewed interest in the coin like that seen during the [223]50
   State Quarters program.^[224][19] At least one third of all dollar
   coins produced are still Sacagawea coins, with the remaining coins
   making up the four presidential coins annually. Under federal law
   ([225]31 U.S.C. [226] 5112), no coins may be issued featuring a living
   president, or a president who died less than two years earlier. The
   program will run until at least 2016 with the coin commemorating
   [227]Ronald Reagan, but may continue longer depending on the longevity
   of the currently living former presidents, and the longevity of the
   current president or presidents yet to be elected.

   The presidential dollar coin is similar in size and color to the
   Sacagawea, but bears no inscription on the obverse (or face) side.
   "[228]In God We Trust", "[229]E Pluribus Unum", the issue year, and the
   mint mark appear on the edge.^[230][20] The fact that these national
   mottoes appear on the edge has caused some conservative commentators to
   decry the designs.^[231][21]^[232][22] The first dollar, honoring
   George Washington, was released into circulation on [233]February 15,
   [234]2007. However, [235]H.R. 2764 became law on [236]December 26,
   [237]2007 which moved "In God We Trust" from the edge to either the
   obverse or reverse.

   A common^[238][23] minting error on this coin is the omission of the
   edge lettering; instead, the outside edge of the coin is plain.
   ^[239][24] Because the omission includes the words "In God We Trust",
   some in the popular media have dubbed it the godless coin. A false
   (although at one time widely reported) error is the report that the
   edge lettering is upside down. The edge lettering does not occur at the
   same time as the minting of the coins, allowing for the natural
   occurrence of the lettering in either orientation.
