Pedal point

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Double pedal)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   For "pedal point" in the mathematical sense, see [9]pedal curve.
   For the "pedal" concept in brass instruments, see [10]pedal tone.

   In [11]tonal music, a pedal point (also pedal tone, pedal note, organ
   point, or pedal) is a [12]sustained tone, typically in the [13]bass,
   during which at least one foreign, i.e., [14]dissonant harmony is
   sounded in the other [15]parts. A pedal point is a "[16]non-chord
   tone", which puts it in the same musical categories as [17]suspensions,
   [18]retardations, and [19]passing tones. However, the pedal point is
   unique among non-chord tones "in that begins on a consonance, sustains
   (or repeats) through another chord as a dissonance until the harmony"
   not the non-chord tone, "resolves back to a consonance." ^[20][1]

   Pedal points "have a strong tonal effect, 'pulling' the harmony back to
   its root." ^[21][1] When a pedal point occurs in a voice other than the
   bass, it is usually referred to as an inverted pedal point^[22][2] (see
   [23]inversion (music)). Pedal points are usually on either the
   [24]tonic or the [25]dominant (fifth note of the scale) tones. The
   pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a
   [26]nonchord tone during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then
   a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point
   may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost
   more like an [27]added tone than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may
   serve as atonal [28]pitch centers.

   The term comes from the [29]organ for its ability to sustain a note
   indefinitely and the tendency for such notes to be played on an organ's
   [30]pedal keyboard. The pedal keyboard on an organ is played by the
   feet; as such, the organist can hold down a pedal point for lengthy
   periods while both hands perform higher-register music on the manual
   keyboards.

[[35]edit] Types

   A double pedal is two pedal tones played simultaneously. An inverted
   pedal is a pedal that is not in the bass (and often is the highest
   part.) [36]Mozart included numerous inverted pedals in his works,
   particularly in the solo parts of his [37]concertos. An internal pedal
   is a pedal that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is
   played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.

   A [38]drone differs from a pedal point in degree or quality. A pedal
   point may be a [39]nonchord tone and thus required to [40]resolve,
   unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be a shorter drone, a drone
   being a longer pedal point.

   Pedal points are often found near the end of [41]fugues "...to
   reestablish the tonality of the composition after it has become clouded
   by the numerous modulations and digressions along the way within the
   middle entries of the subject and answer and in the connecting
   episodes."^[42][3] Fugues often conclude with a music written over a
   bass pedal point.^[43][4]Pedal points are also used in other
   [44]polyphonic compositions to strengthen a final cadence, signal
   important structural points in the composition, and for their dramatic
   effect.

   Pedal points are somewhat problematic on the [45]harpsichord or
   [46]piano, which have only a limited sustain capability. Often the
   pedal note is simply repeated at intervals. A pedal tone can also be
   realized with a [47]trill; this is particularly common with inverted
   pedals. Another method of producing a pedal point on the harpsichord is
   to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The
   rarely-seen pedal harpsichord, a harpsichord with a [48]pedal keyboard
   makes it easier to perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord,
   since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.

   The term is also used to describe a bass note that is held for a long
   period in orchestral music, as in the symphonies of [49]Jean Sibelius.
   Pedal points for orchestral music are often performed by the double
   basses with the bow, which creates a sustained, organ-like bass tone
   underneath the changing harmonies in the upper voices.

[[50]edit] Use in jazz and popular music

   Examples of [51]jazz tunes which include pedal points include [52]Duke
   Ellington's "Satin Doll" (intro), [53]Stevie Wonder's "Too High"
   (intro), [54]Bill Evans's "Skidoo", [55]Herbie Hancock's "Dolphin
   Dance", [56]Pat Metheny's "Lakes", and [57]John Coltrane's "Naima"
   ^[58][5]. The latter, from the album "Giant Steps", has the notation
   "Eb pedal" to instruct the bass player to play a sustained pedal. Jazz
   musicians also use pedal points to add tension to the bridge or solo
   sections of a tune. In an ii-V-I progression, some jazz musicians play
   a V pedal note under all three chords, or under the first two chords.
   Other examples include [59]Miles Davis's "Agitation".

   Pop songs using pedal points include "Fly like an Eagle" by Steve
   Miller Band , "Superstition " by Stevie Wonder and "Crazy" by Seal. The
   [60]progressive rock band [61]Genesis often used a pedal-point groove
   in which the "bass remains static on the tonic as chords move above the
   bass at varying speeds." "By the late 1970s and early 1980s,
   pedal-point grooves such as this had become a well-worn clich of
   progressive rock as they had of funk ([62]James Browns Sex Machine),
   and were already making frequent appearances in more commercial styles
   such as stadium rock ([63]Van Halens Jump) and synth-pop ([64]Frankie
   Goes to Hollywoods Relax)."^[65][6]

   Film composers use pedal points to add tension to thrillers and horror
   films. In the [66]Hitchcock thriller film [67]North by Northwest,
   [68]Bernard Herrmann "...uses the pedal point and ostinato as
   techniques to achieve tension," resulting in a dissonant, dramatic
   effect. In one scene, Herrmann "...uses the [69]timpani playing a low
   pedal B-flat to create a sense of impending doom" as one character is
   arranging for another character's murder.

   Rock guitarists have used pedal points in their solos, especially
   neoclassical guitarists such as [70]Yngwie Malmsteen. Other rock
   guitarists that use pedal points in solos are [71]Steve Vai, [72]Joe
   Satriani, [73]Eric Johnson, [74]John Petrucci, [75]Jason Becker,
   [76]Paul Gilbert, [77]John Sykes and [78]Vinnie Moore. Pedal points can
   be heard on records such as Vinnie Moore's "Time Odyssey" and "Mind's
   Eye"'; Yngwie Malmsteen's "[79]Rising Force"; Jason Becker's "Perpetual
   Burn"; and Richie Kotzen's "Fever Dream". Thrash metal in particular
   makes abundant use a muted low E string as a pedal point. Examples of
   thrash metal bands that make use of a muted low E string pedal point
   include: Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. In small combo jazz
   or [80]jazz fusion groups, the double bass player or Hammond organist
   may also introduce a pedal point (usually on the tonic or the dominant)
   in a tune that does not explicitly request a pedal point, to add
   tension and interest.
