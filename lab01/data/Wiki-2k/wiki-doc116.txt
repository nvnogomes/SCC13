Dolcoath mine

   Harriets Pumping Engine house, part of Dolcoath Mine, built in 1860

   Dolcoath mine was a [9]tin and [10]copper mine in [11]Camborne in
   [12]West [13]Cornwall, with its name coming from the [14]Cornish for
   'Old Ground', and was affectionately know as The Queen of Cornish
   Mines. The mineral rights were owned by the Basset family of Tehidy who
   are recorded on a deed in 1588 as leasing the ground to a family called
   Crane. The earliest records show that the mine was being worked for
   copper in 1720 and probably earlier and it finally closed in 1920. It
   was nearly 300 feet (91 m) deep in 1746 and became an extensive mine by
   1778. In 1788 it closed briefly, only to reopen in 1799. In the next
   120 years it became the largest and deepest mine in Cornwall, with the
   bottom level 3,000 feet (910 m) below the surface. Its output of copper
   and tin ores in 1788 is estimated to value no less than 1,250,000, of
   which copper alone realised 450,000 between 1740 and 1777. Between 1799
   and 1920 its output amounted to over 9 million, including income from
   sales of [15]arsenic, [16]silver and other minerals. The mine was in
   the dividend list for most of its working life and its shares,
   nicknamed 'Dollies', were the 'blue chip' of the industry.

   Dolcoath was the fifth largest copper producer in Cornwall and Devon,
   of which there were altogether about 470 mines, both large and small.
   As depth increased at Dolcoath, the copper died out and was replaced by
   tin. Between 1853 and 1920 Dolcoath produced a little over 100,000 tons
   of 'black tin' or 'tin oxide' - by far the largest output of tin from
   any of the 400 or so mines in Cornwall.

   For many years the principle shaft was known as the New Sump Shaft and
   this ultimately reached a depth of over 3,000 feet (910 m) and its
   historic pumping engine dated from 1815. By 1882 the mine had reached a
   depth of 2,160 feet (660 m) and had 12 miles (19 km) of tunnels
   passable by men and a further 40 miles (64 km) of old workings which
   had become unused and unpassable. In 1893 there was a major accident at
   the 412 fathom level (2,400 feet from the surface) when 7 men lost
   their lives and one miner was rescued unhurt after 37 hours of
   entombment. In 1895 it took men employed in the lower levels between
   2-3 hours to go down and return to the surface and consequently they
   did not work more than 4-5 hours a day.

   In 1920 when it had become virtually worked out and following the tin
   price collapse (new deposits were also being found elsewhere in the
   world) the old Dolcoath mine finally closed. In 1923 the company was
   reconstructed when fresh capital was raised and a new 2,000-foot
   (610 m) circular shaft was sited north of the old mine at Roskear, the
   New Dolcoath Mine, which was actually an amalgamation of several
   smaller mines including Stray Park and Roskear.

   The site is north-west of the village of [17]Brea. Dolcoath Road runs
   between the A3047 road and Chapel Hill. The site is south of this road.
