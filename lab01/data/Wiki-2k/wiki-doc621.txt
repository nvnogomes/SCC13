   The Comintern (Communist International, also known as the Third
   International) was an international [143]Communist organization founded
   in [144]Moscow in March 1919. The International intended to fight "by
   all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the
   international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international
   Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the
   State."^[145][1] The Comintern was founded after the dissolution of the
   [146]Second International in 1916, following the 1915 [147]Zimmerwald
   Conference in which [148]Vladimir Lenin had led the "[149]Zimmerwald
   Left" against those who supported the "[150]national union" governments
   in war with each other.

   The Comintern held seven World Congresses between March 1919 and the
   final congress in 1935. As of 1928 it was estimated that the
   organisation had 583,105 members, excluding its Soviet
   membership.^[151][2]

   At the start of [152]World War II, the Comintern supported a policy of
   non-intervention, arguing that this was an [153]imperialist war between
   various national [154]ruling classes, much as [155]World War I had
   been. However, when the [156]Soviet Union itself was invaded on June
   22, 1941, during [157]Operation Barbarossa, the Comintern switched its
   position to one of active support for the [158]Allies. The Comintern
   was subsequently officially dissolved in 1943.

[[182]edit] From the First to the Second International

   Further information: [183]First International  and [184]Second
   International

   Although divisions between revolutionary and reformist-minded elements
   had been developing for a considerable time, the origins of the
   Communist International derive from the split in the [185]workers'
   movement that surfaced in 1914 with the beginning of the First World
   War. The [186]First International (a.k.a. the "International
   Workingman's Association"), founded in 1864, had split between the
   socialists and the [187]anarchists who preferred not to enter the
   political arena, setting their sights instead on the creation of a
   strong [188]anarcho-syndicalist movement. The Second International,
   founded in 1889, followed, but tensions surfaced again in the new
   International.

[[189]edit] "Socialist participation in a bourgeois government"?

   Further information: [190]Section franaise de l'Internationale ouvrire

   For example, as far back as 1899, reformist or right-wing elements in
   the socialist movement had supported the entry of [191]French
   independent socialist [192]Millerand into [193]Waldeck-Rousseau's
   [194]republican cabinet (1899-1902), which included as [195]Minister of
   War none other than the [196]marquis de Galliffet, best known for his
   role during the repression of the 1871 [197]Paris Commune. On the other
   hand, revolutionary or left-wing elements were fiercely opposed to this
   development. In [198]France, this was represented by the debate between
   [199]Jules Guesde, whom opposed himself to socialist participation in a
   "[200]bourgeois government", and [201]Jean Jaurs, considered as one of
   the founder of [202]social-democracy. Thus, Jules Guesde declared in
   1899:

     "Wherever the [203]proletariat, organized in a class party  which is
     to say a party of revolution - can penetrate an elective assembly;
     wherever it can penetrate an enemy citadel, it has not only the
     right, but the obligation to make a breach and set up a socialist
     garrison in the capitalist fortress! But in those places where it
     penetrates not by the will of the workers, not by socialist force;
     there where it penetrates only with the consent, on the invitation,
     and consequently in the interests of the capitalist class, socialism
     should not enter." [204]Jules Guesde's speech to the 1899 General
     Congress of French socialist organizations

   Criticizing the belief "that by a portfolio granted to one of his own
   socialism has truly conquered power  when its really power that
   conquered him", [205]Jules Guesde thought that "such a state of
   affairs, if we dont quickly put an end to it, would bring on the
   irremediable bankruptcy of socialism. The organized workers considering
   themselves duped, some will lend an ear to [206]propaganda by the
   deed.", thus fostering "[207]anarchy". The same controversy arose the
   next year, when Guesde opposed himself to [208]Jean Jaurs who advocated
   socialist participation to the bourgeois government, during a famous
   [209]November 29, 1900 speech in [210]Lille on the "Two Methods", held
   during several hours before 8,000 persons.

[[211]edit] Revisionism

   Also important was the controversy over the publication of [212]Eduard
   Bernstein's [213]Evolutionary Socialism^[214][3], which espoused a
   [215]reformist path to socialism and received powerful criticism from,
   among others, [216]Karl Kautsky and the young [217]Rosa Luxemburg, who
   criticized him as a [218]revisionist. The revisionist current would
   come to dominate the Second International, one of the factors in the
   subsequent break with it by revolutionary socialists.

[[219]edit] Aftermath of the 1905 Russian Revolution

   The [220]Russian Revolution of 1905 had the effect of radicalizing many
   socialist parties, as did a number of [221]general strikes in pursuit
   of [222]universal suffrage in Western European countries. At this point
   the Second International appeared to be a united body that was growing
   at every election and in every advanced country. [223]Karl Kautsky,
   aptly dubbed the Pope of [224]Marxism, was at his most radical as the
   editor of the highly influential [225]Die Neue Zeit (The New Time), the
   theoretical journal of the massive [226]Social Democratic Party of
   Germany (SPD) which was the flagship of the International.

   However, by 1910, divisions were appearing in the left of Social
   Democracy (as the Marxists who dominated the International described
   themselves), and left-wing thinkers such as [227]Rosa Luxemburg and the
   Dutch theoretician [228]Anton Pannekoek were becoming ever more
   critical of Kautsky. From this point onwards then it is possible to
   speak of there being a reformist right, a centre and a revolutionary
   left within the International. Interestingly, from the point of view of
   later events, both the [229]Menshevik and [230]Bolshevik wings of the
   [231]Russian Social Democratic Labour Party were counted amongst the
   revolutionary left wing. The quarreling groups of Russian [232]emigres
   were not held in high regard by the leaders of the International and
   were unknown to the general public.

[[233]edit] Failure of the Second International confronted with World War I

   World War I was to prove to be the issue which finally and irrevocably
   separated the revolutionary and reformist wings of the workers
   movement. The socialist movement had been historically
   [234]antimilitarist and [235]internationalist, and was therefore
   opposed to being used as "cannon fodder" for the "bourgeois"
   governments at war. This especially since the [236]Triple Alliance
   (1882) gathered two empires, while the [237]Triple Entente itself
   gathered the [238]French Third Republic and the [239]United Kingdom of
   Great Britain and Ireland with the [240]Russian Empire. [241]The
   Communist Manifesto had stated that "the working class has no
   [242]country", and exclaimed "[243]Proletarians of all countries,
   unite!" Massive majorities voted in favor of resolutions for the Second
   International to call upon the international working class to resist
   war should it be declared.

   Despite this, within hours of the declaration of war, almost all the
   socialist parties of the combatant states had announced their support
   for their own countries. The only exceptions were the socialist parties
   of the Balkans, Russia and tiny minorities in other countries. To
   Lenin's surprise, even the [244]German SPD voted the war credits.
   Finally, the assassination of [245]French socialist [246]Jean Jaurs on
   July 31, 1914, killed the last hope of peace, by removing one of the
   few leaders who possessed enough influence on the international
   socialist movement to block it from aligning itself on national
   policies and supporting [247]National Union governments.

   Socialist parties of [248]neutral countries for the most part continued
   to argue for neutrality, and against total opposition to the war. On
   the other hand, Lenin organized the "Zimmerwald Left" opposed to the
   "[249]imperialist war" during the 1915 [250]Zimmerwald Conference, and
   published the [251]pamphlet Socialism and War, in which he called all
   socialists who collaborated with their national governments
   "[252]Social-Chauvinists" (socialist in their words but chauvinist in
   their deeds).

   The International was being divided between a revolutionary left, a
   reformist right and a centre wavering between each pole. Lenin also
   condemned much of the centre, which often opposed the war but refused
   to break [253]party discipline and therefore voted war credits, as
   social-pacifists. This latter term was aimed in particular at
   [254]Ramsay MacDonald (leader of the [255]Independent Labour Party in
   [256]Britain) who did in fact oppose the war on grounds of
   [257]pacifism but had not actively resisted it.

   Discredited by its passivity towards world events, the Second
   International was henceforth dissolved in the middle of the war, in
   1916. In 1917, Lenin published the [258]April Theses, which openly
   supported a "[259]revolutionary defeatism": the Bolsheviks pronounced
   themselves in favour of the defeat of Russia in the war which would
   permit them to pass to the stage of a revolutionary [260]insurrection.

[[261]edit] Founding

   First Congress of the Comintern, 1919

   The Comintern was thus founded in these conditions in at a congress
   March 2-6 1919^[262][4], against the backdrop of the [263]Russian Civil
   War. 19 parties and organisations assisted the congress. There were 52
   delegates present from 34 parties.^[264][5] They decided that an
   Executive Committee would be formed with representatives of the most
   important sections, and that other parties joining the International
   would get their own representatives. The Congress decided that the
   Executive Committee would elect a five-member bureau to run the daily
   affairs of the International. However, such a bureau was not
   constituted and Lenin, Trotsky and [265]Christian Rakovsky later
   delegated the task of managing the International to [266]Grigory
   Zinoviev as the Chairman of the Executive. Zinoviev was assisted by
   [267]Angelica Balbanoff, acting as the secretary of the International,
   [268]Victor L. Kibaltchitch^[269][6] and [270]Vladmir Ossipovich
   Mazin.^[271][7] Material was presented by Lenin, Trotsky and
   [272]Alexandra Kollontai. The main topic of discussion was the
   difference between "[273]bourgeois democracy" and the
   "[274]dictatorship of the proletariat".^[275][8]

[[333]edit] The First Four World Congresses

   An allegorical representation of the Third International. [334]Palekh
   miniature by [335]Ivan Golikov, 1927.

   The first Chairman of the Comintern's Executive Committee was
   [336]Grigory Zinoviev, from 1919 to 1926, but its dominant figure until
   his death in January 1924 was Lenin, whose strategy for revolution had
   been laid out in [337]What Is to Be Done? (1902). The central policy of
   the Comintern under Lenin's leadership was that Communist parties
   should be established across the world to aid the international
   [338]proletarian revolution. The parties also shared his principle of
   [339]democratic centralism, "freedom of discussion, unity of action",
   i.e. that parties would make decisions democratically, but uphold in a
   disciplined fashion whatever decision was made.^[340][11] In this
   period, the Comintern became known as the "[341]General Staff of the
   [342]World Revolution".^[343][12]

   Ahead of the Second Congress of the Communist International, held in
   July-August 1920, Lenin sent out a number of documents, including his
   [344]Twenty-one Conditions to all socialist parties. The Congress
   adopted the 21 conditions as prerequisites for any group wanting to
   become affiliated to the International. The 21 Conditions called for
   the demarcation between Communist parties and other socialist
   groups^[345][13], and instructed the Comintern sections not to trust
   the legality of the bourgeois states. They also called for the build-up
   of party organisations along [346]democratic centralist lines, in which
   the party press and parliamentary factions would be under the direct
   control of the party leadership.

   Regarding the political situation in the colonized world, the second
   congress of the Communist International stipulated at a united front
   should be formed between the proletariat, peasantry and national
   bourgeosie in the colonial countries. Amongst the twenty-one conditions
   drafted by Lenin ahead of the congress was the 11th thesis which
   stipulated that all communist parties must support the
   bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in the colonies. Notably some
   of the delegates opposed the idea of alliance with the bourgeoisie, and
   preferred support to communist movements of these countries instead.
   Their criticism was shared by the Indian revolutionary [347]M.N. Roy,
   who attended as a delegate of the [348]Communist Party of Mexico. The
   congress removed the term bourgeois-democratic' in what became the 8th
   condition.^[349][14]

   Many European socialist parties went through splits on the basis of the
   adhesion or not to the new International. The French [350]SFIO ("French
   Section of the Workers International") thus broke away with the 1920
   [351]Tours Congress, leading to the creation of the new [352]French
   Communist Party (initially called "French Section of the Communist
   International" - SFIC); the [353]Communist Party of Spain was created
   in 1920, the [354]Italian Communist Party was created in 1921, the
   [355]Belgian Communist Party in September 1921, etc.

   Writings from the Third Congress, held in June-July 1921, talked about
   how the struggle could be transformed into "civil war" when the
   circumstances were favorable and "openly revolutionary
   uprisings".^[356][15] The Fourth Congress, November 1922, at which
   [357]Leon Trotsky played a prominent role, continued in this
   vein.^[358][16]

   During this early period, known as the "First Period" in Comintern
   history, with the Bolshevik revolution under attack in the [359]Russian
   Civil War and a [360]wave of revolutions across Europe, the Comintern's
   priority was exporting the October Revolution. Some Communist Parties
   had secret military wings. On example is the [361]M-Apparat of the
   [362]Communist Party of Germany. Its purpose was to prepare for the
   civil war the Communists believed was impending in Germany, and to
   liquidate opponents and informers who might have infiltrated the party.
   There was also a [363]paramilitary organization, the
   [364]Rotfrontkmpferbund.^[365][17]

   The Comintern was involved in the revolutions across Europe in this
   period, starting with the [366]Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919.
   Several hundred agitators and financial aid were sent from the Soviet
   Union and Lenin was in regular contact with its leader, [367]Bela Kun.
   Soon an official "Terror Group of the Revolutionary Council of the
   Government" was formed, unofficially known as "[368]Lenin
   Boys".^[369][18] The next attempt was the "[370]March Action" in
   Germany in 1921, including an attempt to dynamite the express train
   from Halle to Leipzig. When this failed Lenin ordered the removal of
   the leader of the [371]Communist Party of Germany, [372]Paul Levi, from
   power.^[373][19] A new attempt was made at the time of the [374]Ruhr
   Crisis. The [375]Red Army was mobilized, ready to come to the aid of
   the planned insurrection. Resolute action by the German government
   cancelled the plans, except due to miscommunication in Hamburg, where
   200-300 Communists attacked police stations but where quickly
   defeated.^[376][20] In 1924 there was [377]failed coup in Estonia by
   the [378]Estonian Communist Party.^[379][21]

   Several international organizations were sponsored by the Comintern in
   this period:

   In 1924, the [386]Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party joined
   Comintern.^[387][22] In China at first both the Chinese Communist Party
   and the [388]Kuomintang were supported. After the definite break with
   [389]Chiang Kai-shek in 1927, Stalin sent personal emissaries to help
   organize revolts which at this time failed.^[390][23]

[[391]edit] From the Fifth to the Seventh World Congress

[[392]edit] The Second Period

   Lenin died in 1924. 1925 signalled a shift from the immediate activity
   of world revolution towards a defence of the Soviet state. In that
   year, [393]Stalin upheld the thesis of "[394]socialism in one country",
   detailed by [395]Nikolai Bukharin in his brochure Can We Build
   Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the
   West-European Proletariat? (April 1925). The position was finalized as
   the state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article On the Issues of
   Leninism. The perspective of a [396]world revolution was dismissed
   after the failures of the [397]Spartacist uprising in Germany and of
   the Hungarian Soviet Republic, and the reflux of all revolutionary
   movements in Europe, such as in [398]Italy, where the [399]fascist
   [400]squadristi broke the strikes and quickly assumed power following
   the 1922 [401]March on Rome). This period, up to 1928, was known as the
   "Second Period", mirroring the shift in the USSR from [402]war
   communism to the [403]New Economic Policy.^[404][24]

   At the Vth Comintern Congress in July 1924, Zinoviev condemned
   [405]Marxist philosopher [406]Georg Lukcs's History and Class
   Consciousness, published in 1923 after his involvement in [407]Bla
   Kun's [408]Hungarian Soviet Republic, and [409]Karl Korsch's
   [410]Marxism and Philosophy.^[[411]citation needed] Zinoviev himself
   was dismissed in 1926 after falling out of favor with [412]Stalin, who
   already held considerable power by this time. Bukharin then led the
   Comintern for two years, until 1928 when he too fell out with Stalin.
   [413]Bulgarian Communist leader [414]Georgi Dimitrov headed the
   Comintern in 1934 and presided until its dissolution.

[[415]edit] The Third Period

   In 1928, the 9th Plenum of the [416]Executive Committee began the
   so-called "[417]Third Period", which was to last until 1935.^[418][25]
   The Comintern proclaimed that the capitalist system was entering the
   period of final collapse, and that as such, the correct stance for all
   Communist parties was that of an highly aggressive, militant,
   [419]ultra-left line. In particular, the Comintern described all
   moderate left-wing parties as "[420]social fascists", and urged the
   Communists devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate
   left. With the rise of the [421]Nazi movement in Germany after 1930,
   this stance became somewhat controversial with many such as the Polish
   Communist historian [422]Isaac Deutscher criticizing the tactics of the
   [423]Communist Party of Germany of treating the [424]S.P.D. as the
   principal enemy.

   The sixth congress also revised the policy of united front in the
   colonial world. In 1927 the [425]Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese
   communists, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances
   with the national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The congress
   did however make a differentiation between the character of the Chinese
   Kuomintang on one hand and the Indian Swarajist Party and the Egyptian
   [426]Wafd Party on the other, considering the latter as an unreliable
   ally but not a direct enemy. The congress called on the Indian
   communists to utilize the contradictions between the national
   bourgeosie and the British imperialists.^[427][26]

[[428]edit] 7th Congress and the Popular Front

   The seventh and last congress of the Comintern was held between July 25
   and August 20 1935. It was attended by representatives of 65 communist
   parties. The main report was delivered by Dimitrov, other reports were
   delivered by [429]Palmiro Togliatti, [430]Wilhelm Pieck and [431]Dmitry
   Manuilsky.^[432][27] The congress officially endorsed the [433]Popular
   Front against fascism. This policy argued that Communist Parties should
   seek to form a Popular Front with all parties that opposed fascism and
   not limit themselves to forming a [434]United Front with those parties
   based in the working class. There was no significant opposition to this
   policy within any of the national sections of the Comintern; in France
   and Spain in particular, it would have momentous consequences with
   [435]Lon Blum's 1936 election, which led to the [436]Popular Front
   government.

   The [437]Stalin [438]purges of the 1930s affected Comintern activists
   living in both the USSR and overseas. At Stalin's direction, the
   Comintern was thoroughly infused with Soviet secret police and foreign
   intelligence operatives and informers working under Comintern guise.
   One of its leaders, [439]Mikhail Trilisser, using the pseudonym
   'Mikhail Aleksandrovich Moskvin', was in fact chief of the foreign
   department of the Soviet [440]OGPU (later, the [441]NKVD). At Stalin's
   orders, 133 out of 492 Comintern staff members became victims of the
   [442]Great Purge. Several hundred German Communists and antifascists
   who had either fled from Nazi Germany or were convinced to relocate in
   the Soviet Union were liquidated, and more than a thousand were handed
   over to Germany.^[443][28] [444]Fritz Platten died in a labor camp; the
   leaders of the Indian ([445]Virendranath Chattopadhyaya or Chatto),
   Korean, Mexican, Iranian and Turkish Communist parties were executed.
   Out of 11 Mongolian Communist Party leaders, only [446]Khorloogiin
   Choibalsan survived. A great number of German Communists were handed
   over to [447]Hitler. [448]Leopold Trepper recalled these days: "In
   house, where the party activists of all the countries were living,
   no-one slept until 3 o'clock in the morning.[..] Exactly 3 o'clock the
   car lights began to be seen [...]. we stayed near the window and waited
   [to find out], where the car stopped."^[449][29]

[[450]edit] Comintern and Communist Party of China

   The complicated relationship between the Comintern and the
   [451]Communist Party of China (CPC) is an important chapter in the
   history of Comintern.

[[452]edit] 1921 to 1927

   The CPC was established in 1921 with the help of Comintern. The CPC
   declared itself as a branch of the Comintern. At that time, China had a
   big revolutionary party called The National Party of China
   ([453]Kuomintang). Its leader, Dr. [454]Sun Yatsen, frustrated by the
   refusal of help from western countries, quickly turned to the Soviet
   Union and Comintern. Under the instruction of the
   Comintern,^[[455]citation needed] the CPC joined the Kuomintang.
   Kuomintang applied for membership in Comintern, but was not accepted.
   However, the Comintern viewed Kuomintang as a quasi-Communist
   Party.^[[456]citation needed] Sun Yatsens successor, [457]Chiang
   Kai-shek, was once elected as an honorary member of the standing
   committee in Comintern.{cn}}

[[458]edit] 1927 to 1935

   After the success of the joint revolution of the Kuomintang and CPC,
   they split. The Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek turned into an
   anti-communist force. The Comintern instructed the Communists to
   initiate urban riots, but all failed.^[[459]citation needed] A group of
   native Communists, such as [460]Mao Zedong, used peasant riots to
   establish the [461]Soviet Republic of China in remote mountain
   villages. The Comintern sent a German, [462]Otto Braun, as the military
   adviser, who became the real highest commander later.^[[463]citation
   needed] [464]Zhou Enlai, once the Comintern's favorite,^[[465]citation
   needed] was the chairman of the military committee of CPC. After being
   besieged by Chiang Kai-sheks army, the [466]Red Army had to escape to
   try to find a new base - this came to be known as the [467]Long March
   (1934-1935).

[[468]edit] 1935 to 1942

   During the Long March, the party leadership re-examined its policy in
   [469]Zunyi (January 1935). [470]Mao Zedong blamed their failure on
   blindly following the Comintern's instructions. During the heated
   debate, [471]Zhou Enlai unexpectedly accepted the criticism and sided
   with Mao. Otto Braun was dismissed from his commanding position.

   After they resettled in [472]Yanan, the native Communists, such as Mao
   and [473]Zhu De, gained power. Those who were loyal to the Comintern,
   such as a group called [474]28 Bolsheviks, fell from important
   positions. Zhou Enlai became an assistant to Mao in political affairs,
   such as [475]United Front and diplomacy. The Comintern and Soviet Union
   could no longer control the CPC. The Comintern continued to give
   advice, but much was ignored.

   An exception was the [476]Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army,
   organized by the [477]Manchuria branch of the CPC in 1932.
   Geographically separated from the CPC headquarters in [478]Yenan, this
   [479]guerrilla army did not report directly to the CPC center, but was
   still led and supported by the Soviet Union under the name of Comintern
   until it was defeated by Japanese occupation force and fled to the
   Soviet Union in 1942.

[[480]edit] Dissolution

   At the start of [481]World War II, the Comintern supported a policy of
   [482]non-intervention, arguing that the war was an imperialist war
   between various national ruling classes, much like [483]World War I had
   been (see [484]Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact). But when the Soviet Union
   itself was invaded on 22 June 1941, the Comintern changed its position
   to one of active support for the [485]Allies.

   On May 15, 1943, a declaration of the [486]Executive Committee was sent
   out to all sections of the International, calling for the dissolution
   of Comintern. The declaration read:

     "The historical role of the Communist International, organised in
     1919 as a result of the political collapse of the overwhelming
     majority of the old pre-war workers parties, consisted in that it
     preserved the teachings of Marxism from vulgarisation and distortion
     by opportunist elements of the labor movement. ... But long before
     the war it became increasingly clear that, to the extent that the
     internal as well as the international situation of individual
     countries became more complicated, the solution of the problems of
     the labor movement of each individual country through the medium of
     some international centre would meet with insuperable obstacles."

   Concretely, the declaration asked the member sections to approve:

     "To dissolve the Communist International as a guiding centre of the
     international labor movement, releasing sections of the Communist
     International from the obligations ensuing from the constitution and
     decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International."

   After endorsements of the declaration was received from the member
   sections, the International was dissolved.^[487][30] Messages between
   Tito and Dimitrov the Secretary-General in Moscow were intercepted and
   decrypted by the British GC&CS ([488]Bletchley Park) from 1943, though
   the volume of messages was not great (the first message from Walter
   (Tito) was intercepted on 21 April, though not decrypted until many
   months later). They showed the level of control exercised over him
   (Tito) by Moscow and continued with Dimitrov after June 1943, when the
   Comintern itself was dissolved ^[489][31].

   Usually, it is asserted that the dissolution came about as Stalin
   wished to calm his World War II [490]Allies (particularly [491]Franklin
   Delano Roosevelt and [492]Winston Churchill) not to suspect that the
   Soviet Union was pursuing a policy of trying to foment revolution in
   other countries.^[493][32]

[[494]edit] Successor organisations

   The [495]International Department of the Central Committee of the
   Communist Party of the Soviet Union was founded at roughly the same
   time that the Comintern was abolished in 1943, although its specific
   duties during the first several years of its existence are
   unknown.^[496][33]

   In September 1947, following the June 1947 Paris Conference on
   [497]Marshall Aid, Stalin gathered a grouping of key European communist
   parties and set up the [498]Cominform, or Communist Information Bureau,
   often seen as a substitute to the Comintern. It was a network made up
   of the [499]Communist parties of [500]Bulgaria, [501]Czechoslovakia,
   [502]France, [503]Hungary, [504]Italy, [505]Poland, [506]Romania, the
   Soviet Union, and [507]Yugoslavia (led by [508]Tito, it was expelled in
   June 1948). The Cominform was dissolved in 1956, following Stalin's
   1953 death and the [509]XXth Congress of the CPSU.

   While the Communist parties of the world no longer had a formal
   international organisation, they continued to maintain close relations
   with each other, through a series of international forums. In the
   period directly after dissolution of Comintern, periodical meetings of
   Communist parties where held in [510]Moscow. Moreover [511]World
   Marxist Review, a joint periodical of the Communist parties, played an
   important role in coordinating the communist movement up to the
   break-up of the [512]Socialist Bloc in 1989-1991.
