[[45]edit] Design and development

   Interior of an Embraer 170

   The Embraer E-Jets line is composed of two main commercial families and
   a [46]business jet variant. The smaller E-170 and E-175 make up the
   base model aircraft, with the E-190 and E-195 being stretched versions,
   with different [47]engines and larger [48]wing and [49]landing gear
   structures. The 170 and 175 share 95% commonality, as do the 190 and
   195. The two families share near 89% commonality, with identical
   [50]fuselage cross-sections and [51]avionics, featuring the
   [52]Honeywell Primus Epic [53]EFIS suite.

   Although commonly referred to with simply an "E" prefix, the jets are
   technically still Embraer Regional Jets ("ERJ"s).^[54][3] Embraer
   dropped the ERJ prefix in its advertising early in production. The
   E-190/195 series of aircraft have similar capacities to the initial
   versions of the [55]DC-9 and [56]Boeing 737, which have always been
   considered mainline airliners. Embraer E-Jets use four-abreast seating.

[[58]edit] E-170/175

   A Cirrus Airlines E-170
   An E-175, in company demonstrator colours, on the ramp at the
   [59]Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport

   The E-170 family is the smaller of the two, competing with regional
   aircraft such as the [60]Bombardier CRJ-700/900, [61]Bombardier Q400
   and the [62]Sukhoi Superjet 100. It also seeks to replace the market
   segment occupied by earlier competing designs such as the [63]BAe 146
   and [64]Fokker 70. The 170 and 175 are powered with [65]GE [66]CF34-8E
   engines of 13,800 pounds (61.39 kN) [67]thrust each.

   The Embraer 170 was the first version produced. The [68]prototype was
   rolled out on [69]29 October [70]2001, with first flight 119 days later
   on February 19. The aircraft was displayed to the public in May 2002 at
   the [71]Regional Airline Association convention. After a positive
   response from the airline community, Embraer proceeded with the launch
   of the stretched E-175 in June 2003. [72]Certification for the 170 took
   nearly 2 years after the public debut; delivery of the first aircraft
   to the launch customer [73]LOT Polish Airlines^[[74]citation needed]
   was in March 2004.

   As of 2008, the E-170 is operated in the United States by regional
   airlines [75]Shuttle America and [76]Republic Airlines upon [77]Delta
   Connection, [78]US Airways Express, [79]Midwest Connect and [80]United
   Express, routes. Asia's first operator was [81]Hong Kong Express
   Airways with a fleet of 4 Embraer 170s. [82]J-Air, a subsdiary of
   [83]Japan Airlines (JAL) will introduce the type to service in 2008
   following an order in 2007 for 10 aircraft with 5 options.^[84][4]
     * Embraer 170 (or ERJ 170-100) - In August 2006 111 Embraer 170
       aircraft (all variants) remain in airline service, with 30 orders.
       Major operators include: [85]Finnair (10) (4 leased), [86]LOT
       Polish Airlines (10), [87]Republic Airlines (28) and [88]Shuttle
       America (45). Six airlines operate the type in smaller
       numbers.^[89][5] In September 2006, [90]EgyptAir announced that it
       will place a firm order of 6 airplanes with an option for another 6
       for its newly launched subsidiary, [91]EgyptAir Express. These
       Embraer 170 aircraft will be used to fly to domestic and regional
       destinations. The 400th Embraer 170 was sold in June 2008 to the
       U.S. based company, [92]Republic Airlines.^[93][6]

     * Embraer 175 (or ERJ 170-200) - In August 2006, 20 Embraer 175-200LR
       aircraft were in airline service, with 68 further orders. Major
       operators include [94]Air Canada with 15 aircraft and [95]LOT
       Polish Airlines with 18 aircraft^[[96]citation needed]. Major firm
       orders include 30 aircraft for [97]Republic Airlines and 36
       aircraft for [98]Compass Airlines (a subsidiary of [99]Northwest
       Airlines).^[100][5] India-based [101]Paramount Airways has ordered
       ten 86-seater Embraer 175s. [102]TRIP Linhas Areas also holds a
       frim order for five Embraer 175.^[103][7]

[[104]edit] E-190/195

   [105]Air Canada Embraer ERJ 190

   The E-190 family is a larger stretch of the E-170 model fitted with a
   new, larger wing and a new engine, the GE CF34-10E, rated at 18,500 lb
   (82.30 kN). Being in the 100-seat range, it competes with smaller
   [106]jets including the [107]Bombardier CRJ-1000, [108]Boeing
   [109]717-200 and [110]737-600 as well as the [111]Airbus
   [112]A318.^[[113]citation needed]

   The first flight of the E-190 was in March 2004, with the first flight
   of the E-195 in December of the same year. The launch customer of the
   E-190 was [114]New York-based [115]low cost carrier [116]JetBlue with
   100 orders and 100 options. European [117]low cost carrier [118]Flybe
   launched the E-195 with 14 orders and 12 options.^[119][8]

   As the 190/195 family is of mainline aircraft size, many airlines will
   operate them as such, fitting them with a business class section and
   operating them themselves, instead of having them flown by a commuter
   airline partner.^[[120]citation needed] For example, [121]Air Canada
   operates 45 E-190 aircraft fitted with 9 business-class and 84
   economy-class seats as part of their primary fleet.
     * Embraer 190 (or ERJ 190-100) - In August 2006, 36 Embraer 190
       aircraft (all variants) are in airline service, with 249 orders.
       Operators include: [122]Air Canada with 45 aircraft and
       [123]JetBlue Airways with 27 aircraft (and 80 firm orders). Other
       orders include 57 aircraft for [124]US Airways.^[125][5]
       [126]Hainan Airlines is to order 50 ERJ-190s, becoming the largest
       customer in [127]China. In [128]Mexico the only E-190 operator is
       [129]Aeromxico Connect with 4 operational aircraft and 12 more on
       order. [130]SkyAirWorld Operates 1 E190 with another few on order.

     * Embraer 195 (or ERJ 190-200) - In August 2006, there were 36 orders
       for the Embraer 195 aircraft (all variants), from [131]Royal
       Jordanian (7), [132]Flybe (14), Deutsche [133]Lufthansa for its
       [134]Air Dolomiti subsidiary (5) and [135]Swiss International Air
       Lines. Flybe has taken delivery of the first Embraer 195 Jets
       (15).^[136][5] Five are on order for [137]Indian [138]Paramount
       Airways, while [139]Montenegro Airlines chose to expand its fleet
       with two such airplanes. The recently launched [140]Azul Brazilian
       Airlines has also announced orders for this aircraft type.

[[141]edit] Embraer Lineage 1000

          Main article: [142]Embraer Lineage 1000

   On [143]2 May [144]2006 Embraer announced plans for the business jet
   variant of the E-190. This would have the same structure as the E-190,
   but with an extended range of up to 4,200 nm, and luxury seating for up
   to 19. The Argentinian Air Force ordered one for VIP purposes.

[[145]edit] Embraer C-390

          Main article: [146]Embraer C-390

   The technology developed for Embraer's E-jets will be incorporated in a
   future military transport aircraft called the C-390.

[[147]edit] Operational history

   [148]Azul Brazilian Airlines ordered 36 E-195 jets, with another 40 on
   option, expected to arrive in January 2009. Azul will become Brazil's
   first airline to operate the type.^[149][9]

   [150]Aeromxico Connect, the express subsidiary of [151]Aeromxico has
   recently integrated 4 E-190s for domestic and international services,
   becoming the first airline in [152]Mexico to operate the type. The 99
   seater is operating in some markets that were served with mainline
   [153]McDonnell Douglas [154]MD-87 equipment. The airline has also
   announced the order for 12 more aircraft of this type.

   Air Canada currently owns and operates 15 Embraer 175 aircraft and 45
   Embraer 190 aircraft. All of them came factory fitted with the XM
   (Extreme Makeover) project. Air Canada currently operates in the
   Caribbean and North America with these aircraft.^[[155]citation needed]

   [156]BA CityFlyer has ordered 11 E-Jets for use out of [157]London City
   Airport and are due to receive them in the latter half of
   2009.^[158][10]

   [159]EgyptAir Express, the regional subsidiary of the Egyptian national
   carrier, [160]EgyptAir, launched operations in June 2007 with the
   arrival of the first of six Embraer 170s. All six will be delivered
   before October 2007, when the six options are expected to be converted
   to firm orders for either the Embraer 190 or 195^[[161]citation
   needed].

   [162]Finnair, the national airline of [163]Finland, has 10 Embraer 170
   and eight Embraer 190.^[164][11] Finnair also has five unfilled orders,
   to be delivered in 2009 and 2010.

   The largest single order for any type of E-Jets has come from
   [165]JetBlue with 100 orders for the E-190, and options for 100
   more.^[166][12] JetBlue set the record for the longest flight of the
   E190 family on November 6, 2008, when aircraft N239JB made a non-stop
   flight from Anchorage, Alaska (ANC) to Buffalo, New York (BUF), a total
   of 2,694 nautical miles. This was an empty aircraft on a non-revenue
   flight, the aircraft eventually returning to JFK after a two-month long
   charter service with Vice Presidential candidate Sarah
   Palin.^[[167]citation needed]

   [168]Kenya Airways has an order for three Embraer 170 jets to be leased
   through [169]GECAS. Delivery is to start in the second quarter of 2007
   and be completed in mid 2008. The 170 will replace a pair of [170]Saab
   340 turboprops serving domestic short haul routes.^[171][13]

   [172]LOT Polish Airlines, the national airline of [173]Poland, has 10
   Embraer 170, 10 Embraer 145 and six Embraer 175 with 12 on order,
   making it the biggest Embraer carrier in Europe.^[[174]citation needed]

   [175]Rgional became the first European operator of the Embraer 190 on
   [176]23 November [177]2006 when the first of six on order was
   delivered.^[178][14]

   [179]Royal Jordanian, the national airline of [180]Jordan, operates
   five Embraer 195s, 2 Embraer 175s and has options for 12 more Embraer
   195s. It was the first Arab airline to operate the Embraer 195 and the
   second to operate the Embraer 175.^[181][15]

   [182]SkyAirWorld, the first Australian operator, has taken delivery of
   its first E170 from [183]Hong Kong Express in March 2007, with an
   additional five aircraft on order next year (four 190s and one 170).
   From 1 May 2007, SkyAirWorld will operate an 170 on behalf of
   [184]Solomon Airlines on flights from [185]Honiara to [186]Brisbane,
   [187]Espiritu Santo and [188]Nadi^[189][16]^[190][17]

   [191]Virgin Blue, an Australian low cost carrier, has ordered Embraer
   170s and 190s to compete against QantasLink on the
   Sydney-Canberra(capital)/Albury/Port Maquarie/Mackay routes, freeing up
   the Boeing 737 fleet to compete on similar routes to Jetstar, Tiger
   Airways, and Freedom Air.^[192][18] In December 2008, the airline
   expanded its E170 route coverage, commencing Summer operations on the
   [193]Launceston-[194]Brisbane route.^[195][19]
