   Bay City is a city in the [40]U.S. state of [41]Michigan located near
   the base of the [42]Saginaw Bay on [43]Lake Huron. As of the [44]2000
   census, the city's population was 36,817, with the [45]2007 census
   estimate placing the population at 34,026. It is the [46]county seat of
   [47]Bay County^[48][3] and is the principal city of the Bay City
   [49]Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the
   [50]Saginaw-Bay City-[51]Saginaw Township North [52]Combined
   Statistical Area. The city, along with nearby [53]Midland and
   [54]Saginaw, form the "Tri-Cities" region.

   The city is geographically divided by the [55]Saginaw River, and travel
   between the east and west sides of the city is made possible by four
   modern [56]drawbridges which allow large ships to easily travel down
   the river. The city is served by [57]MBS International Airport, located
   in nearby [58]Freeland, and [59]James Clements Municipal Airport.

[[76]edit] History

   Bay City was first established in 1837, and was incorporated as a city
   in 1865. Twenty-five years after [77]Leon Trombley became the first
   permanent settler to build a log-cabin along the river at what is now
   Fourth Street, Bay City became the largest community in the county and
   the location of the county seat of government. Most of the county's
   agencies and associations are located here. The city shares common
   borders with [78]Essexville and the townships of [79]Bangor,
   [80]Frankenlust, [81]Hampton, [82]Merritt, [83]Monitor, and
   [84]Portsmouth.

   Bay City was originally known as "Lower Saginaw," and fell within the
   boundaries of [85]Saginaw County until Bay County was organized in
   1857. It was at this time that the name was changed to Bay City. While
   [86]Saginaw had the first white settlement in this area in 1819, larger
   ships had difficulty navigating the shallower water near the Saginaw
   settlement. Due to this fact, many of the early pioneers moved to Lower
   Saginaw as it became clear its deeper waters made it a better location
   for the growth of industry which relied on shipping. By 1860, Lower
   Saginaw had become a bustling community of about 2,000 people with
   several mills and many small businesses in operation. In 1865, the
   village of Bay City was incorporated as a city. Rapid economic growth
   took place during this time period, with [87]lumbering, [88]milling,
   and [89]shipbuilding creating many jobs. The early industrialists in
   the area used the Saginaw River as a convenient means to float lumber
   to the mills and factories and as a consequence amass large fortunes.
   Many of the mansions built during this era are registered as historical
   landmarks by the state and federal government.

   In 1873, [90]Charles C. Fitzhugh, Jr., a Bay City pioneer, and his
   wife, Jane, purchased land and built a home on property bounded by
   Washington, Saginaw, Ninth and Tenth Streets, which later became the
   location for City Hall. Fitzhugh dealt on a large scale in wild lands
   and farms, being an agent for over 25,000 acres (101 km) of land in Bay
   County. During this time, Washington Avenue was primarily developed
   with residential homes. Businesses were concentrated along Water Street
   near the Saginaw River. As time went on, businesses started to expand
   along Washington Avenue. In 1891, the Fitzhughs sold the land to the
   City of Bay City for [91]$8,500 "to be used for the erection of a City
   Hall and offices and for no other purposes whatever."

   Until 1905, the City of Bay City was limited to the east bank of the
   [92]Saginaw River. Previous to that date, the city occupying the west
   bank of the Saginaw River was a separate city known as West Bay City.
   The unified Bay City celebrated its centennial in 2005.

   During the latter half of the 19th century Bay City was the home of
   several now-closed industries including many sawmills and shipbuilders.
   The [93]Defoe Shipbuilding Company, which ceased operations December
   31, 1975 built [94]destroyer escorts, [95]guided missile destroyers,
   and [96]patrol craft for the [97]United States Navy. To maintain this
   strong Naval heritage, the [98]Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum is
   working through the Naval Sea Systems Command to bring the [99]USS
   Edson (DD-946) to Bay City as a museum ship; the Navy is expected to
   make a decision in the Spring of 2008. Another important part of the
   city's industrial history is Industrial Brownhoist, which was
   well-known for its construction of large industrial cranes.

[[100]edit] Notable events in city history

   In September 1990, The tankship MV Jupiter was unloading gasoline at
   the Total Petroleum Terminal. A passing cargo ship, the Buffalo, moving
   at excessive speed, created a wake that caused the Jupiter to break
   free of its berth. A fire and explosion ensued, and one man was
   drowned. There was considerable legal action taken, ultimately
   resulting in an adjudication that was subsequently appealed by the
   owners of the Buffalo. The findings of the Court of Appeals upheld the
   original decision, which assigned 50% of the responsibility to the
   Buffalo (for her excessive speed), 25% to the dock operator (for rotten
   wood pilings) and 25% to the Jupiter (for improper procedures in
   unloading her cargo).^[101][4]^[102][5]

   On January 13, 2009, Bay City Electric Light and Power, Bay City's
   wholly owned municipal power company, installed a "limiter" device to
   restrict the receipt of power to the home of [103]Marvin Schur, a
   93-year-old Bay City resident and World War II veteran, likely
   contributing to Mr. Schur's death from hypothermia in his home a few
   days later. The power company restricted the home's energy consumption
   due to Schur's failure to pay an outstanding bill, purported to be in
   excess of $1,000.^[104][6] On February 4, 2009, it was revealed that
   Mr. Schur had willed his entire remaining estate, estimated by family
   members to be in excess of $500,000.00, to Bay Regional Medical Center
   for the benefit of the hospital and residents of Bay City.^[105][7]

[[106]edit] Geography

   According to the [107]United States Census Bureau, the city has a total
   area of 11.3 square miles (29.3 km), of which, 10.4 square miles
   (27.0 km) of it is land and 0.9 square miles (2.4 km) of it (8.12%) is
   water.

   Bay City along with [108]Saginaw, and [109]Midland make up the
   [110]Tri-Cities Area, a sub-region of [111]Flint/Tri-Cities. Sometimes,
   Bay City can be seen as in the greater [112]Thumb of Michigan Area,
   which is also a sub-region of the Flint/Tri-Cities.

   Route M-13 and [127]Michigan Route M-84 over the river. The
   [128]Veterans Memorial Bridge, opened in 1957, carries [129]Michigan
   Route M-25 over the river. [130]Independence Bridge, opened in 1973,
   carries Truman Parkway over the river, replacing the earlier Belinda
   Street Bridge (built in 1893). [131]Liberty Bridge, opened in 1990?,
   connects Vermont Street (on the west side of the river) and Woodside
   Avenue (on the east side).

[[147]edit] Culture

   Bay City's Firework Festival - 2005

   Bay City is well known in Mid-Michigan for its numerous festivals and
   celebrations which take place during the summer months. Among them are
   the River Roar, [148]St. Stan's Polish Festival, the Independence Day
   Fireworks Festival, the Pig Gig Rib Roast, and the River of Time living
   history reenactment. Many of these events take place along one or more
   banks of the [149]Saginaw River, often in Wenonah Park on the east bank
   or the larger Veterans Memorial Park on the west bank.

   The Bay County Historical Museum, located on Washington Avenue, is the
   designated repository for the records of the Patrol Craft Sailors
   Association and also contains numerous displays on local and regional
   history. Over the past several years, the museum has expanded
   significantly. It is housed in the former armory building on Washington
   Avenue, adjacent to the historic City Hall.

   The [150]Scottish band the [151]Bay City Rollers were named after this
   city based on the results of a dart thrown randomly at a map.

[[152]edit] Legend and folklore

   It is the contention of many local residents that the fictional
   [153]lumberjack, [154]Paul Bunyan, was based on an infamous lumberjack
   Fabian "Saginaw Joe" Fournier, a lumberjack who frequented the Bay City
   [155]waterfront.^[156][8]

   It has been rumored on several occasions that the remains of former
   [157]Teamsters union president [158]Jimmy Hoffa, who mysteriously
   disappeared in 1975, is buried somewhere in the Bay City
   area.^[[159]citation needed] In July 2003, acting on a tip from
   convicted killer Richard Powell, authorities excavated the area beneath
   a swimming pool in the backyard of a home in the adjacent municipality
   of [160]Hampton Township. No remains were found.^[161][9]
