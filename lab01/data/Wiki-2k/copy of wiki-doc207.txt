   Donna Lynn Awatere Huata (sometimes written Awatere-Huata, previously
   known as Donna Awatere) is a former member of the [9]New Zealand
   Parliament, and former activist for [10]Mori causes. In 2004 she was
   expelled from [11]Parliament and subsequently convicted of [12]fraud.

[[19]edit] Early life

   Donna Awatere was born in the city of [20]Rotorua in 1949, and was
   educated in [21]Auckland. Her primary area of study was education,
   particularly [22]educational psychology, but she has also undertaken
   study in [23]operatic singing and [24]film production.

   Her father, Colonel [25]Arapeta Awatere was a prominent member of the
   [26]Mori Battalion, but also a violent husband and authoritarian
   father. In 1969 he was convicted of the murder of his mistress's lover
   and sent to jail, where he eventually died.^[27][1]

[[28]edit] Activism

   From the 1970s Awatere became involved in the [29]Mori protest
   movement, including the group [30]Nga Tamatoa. She was a leading
   protester against the [31]1981 Springbok Tour, and in 1984 she
   published Maori Sovereignty, which became a key text in the Mori
   protest movement. She was also involved in [32]feminist politics, and
   Maori Sovereignty was originally written for the feminist magazine
   [33]Broadsheet. She was critical of white feminists who ignored issues
   of race, and expressed the opinion that the problems facing Mori were
   more important than those facing women and other marginalised groups.
   At this time she was broadly [34]Marxist, although she later admitted
   that she had trouble understanding Marxist theory, and attributed this
   to Marxist theory being fundamentally flawed. In Maori Sovereignty she
   is generally critical of the established left.

   After the publication of Maori Sovereignty, Awatere retired from
   protest and became a [35]biculturalism consultant for various
   organisations, including the [36]New Zealand Treasury and the [37]New
   Zealand Police. She also developed a children's reading programme,
   which she later promoted through the Pipi Foundation. During this
   period she married [38]Wi Huata and changed her surname from Awatere to
   Awatere Huata.

[[39]edit] Member of Parliament

                                        Parl. Electorate List Pos.   Party
                                     [40]45th       List         4 [41]ACT
                                     [42]46th       List         4 [43]ACT
                                     [44]47th       List         5 [45]ACT

   Shortly before the [46]1996 election, Awatere Huata joined the [47]ACT
   New Zealand party. This surprised many commentators, as [48]ACT was not
   generally associated with the sort of cause that Awatere Huata had
   previously supported. She was ranked in fourth place on [49]ACT's party
   list, and stood as a candidate in the Mori electorate of Te Puku O Te
   Whenua. She was not successful in her electorate race, but entered
   [50]Parliament as a [51]list MP. In the [52]1999 elections, she
   retained her fourth place ranking on the [53]party's list, and
   consequently remained in [54]Parliament. In the [55]2002 elections, she
   was lowered to fifth place on the list, but nevertheless remained in
   parliament comfortably.

[[56]edit] Conviction for fraud

   In late 2002, the [57]Dominion Post newspaper reported evidence that
   Awatere Huata had appropriated public money for her own use. The money
   in question belonged to the Pipi Foundation. Some of this money was
   alleged to have been spent by Awatere Huata on a secret [58]gastric
   bypass operation which resulted in a dramatic weight loss that was much
   commented upon in women's magazines. She had claimed this weight loss
   was purely the result of willpower and diet.

   Awatere Huata strongly denied the accusations, but further
   investigation (much of it conducted by the [59]Dominion Post) provided
   sufficient grounds for an official enquiry by the [60]Serious Fraud
   Office. On 11 February, the [61]ACT party expelled her from [62]caucus,
   although not from the party itself.

   The final report on Awatere Huata's dealings was not completed until
   November that year, however. Investigators claimed that the delay was
   caused by total lack of cooperation from Awatere Huata, which Awatere
   Huata denies. The report was highly critical of her, and she was
   charged (along with her husband) with multiple counts of fraud. She was
   also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice.

   During this time, Awatere Huata's membership of the [63]ACT party had
   lapsed, something which Awatere Huata claims was accidental. When she
   reapplied for membership, however, [64]ACT indicated that it would not
   accept her. [65]ACT then informed the [66]Speaker that Awatere Huata
   should no longer be considered a member of [67]ACT. The [68]Speaker
   concurred, and declared Awatere Huata an independent.

   [69]ACT shortly afterwards attempted to invoke the Electoral Integrity
   Act, which was designed to limit the ability of MPs to change parties.
   Under this law, MPs who change their allegiance in a way that "distorts
   the proportionality" of [70]Parliament must vacate their seat. [71]ACT
   contended that because Awatere Huata is no longer a member of the
   party, the party had less strength in [72]Parliament than its last
   election result awarded it, thereby undermining [73]proportional
   representation. Awatere Huata, however, claimed that even if she was
   not a member of [74]ACT, she still voted according to [75]ACT policies,
   ensuring that the public still got the policies that they voted for. In
   a long battle, Awatere Huata sought a court injunction against the
   Electoral Integrity Act being invoked. The High Court initially refused
   an injunction, but was overruled by the Court of Appeal. Finally, on
   [76]18 November, the [77]Supreme Court unanimously upheld the original
   decision, allowing the law to be invoked. The following day, the
   [78]Speaker declared Awatere-Huata's seat to be vacant. She was
   replaced in [79]Parliament by [80]Kenneth Wang, the next person on
   [81]ACT's party list.

   On [82]23 August [83]2005, Awatere Huata and her husband were convicted
   on multiple charges of fraud. On [84]30 September [85]2005, Awatere
   Huata was sentenced to 2 years and nine months in prison and husband Wi
   was given 2 years with a possibility of home detention. The court room
   was packed with over one hundred Mori leaders and activists, plus the
   Huata family. As the sentencing was read by Judge Roderick Joyce, the
   crowd in the court yelled and jeered so much the judge stopped
   sentencing. As the crowd, 20 of whom drove up from [86]Hastings, yelled
   and held up "racism" signs. Donna and Wi merely stood still with little
   emotion as they stared into each others eyes.

   Wi Huata's [87]transgendered brother Hira caused such an uproar between
   yelling "white justice" to the judge and doing an impromptu haka with
   sister Huia that he had to be stopped in order for proceedings to
   continue. Mrs Awatere Huata's [88]lawyer Guyon Foley said he was not
   sure whether his client would appeal but Wi Huata's lawyer said he was
   considering an appeal. The large crowd outside the District court
   created a commotion as Mrs Huata was taken in a police guard, and
   police officers stood by as screaming and yelling continued at
   reporters from the activists and Huata family.
