   This article is about the Pink Floyd song. For other meanings, see
   [46]Echoes.

   "Echoes" is a song by [47]Pink Floyd, including lengthy instrumental
   passages, sound effects, and [48]musical improvisation. Written by all
   four members of the group ([49]Roger Waters, [50]Richard Wright,
   [51]David Gilmour, and [52]Nick Mason), "Echoes" provides the extended
   finale to Pink Floyd's album [53]Meddle. The track has a running time
   of 23:31 and takes up the entire second side of the vinyl recording. It
   is widely considered one of Pink Floyd's most ambitious and musically
   diverse compositions.

   It also appears in shortened form as the fifth track on the compilation
   album which took its name, [54]Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. "Echoes"
   is the third-longest song in Pink Floyd's catalogue, after "[55]Atom
   Heart Mother" (23:44) and the combined segments of "[56]Shine On You
   Crazy Diamond" (26:01). Unlike those pieces, it is not explicitly
   divided into separate parts; however, the composition was originally
   assembled from separate fragments, and was later split in two parts to
   serve as both the opening and closing numbers in the band's film
   [57]Live at Pompeii.

   Echoes in [73]CoolEdit 2000, showing the dynamics of the work

   Each verse of the song follows a pattern of three [74]strophes.

   The composition uses many progressive and unconventional musical
   effects.The [75]ping sound heard at the beginning of the song was
   created as the result of an experiment at the very beginning of the
   Meddle sessions. It was produced through amplifying a grand piano and
   sending the signal through a [76]Leslie rotating speaker. Gilmour used
   the slide for certain sound effects on the studio recording, and for
   the introduction in live performances from 1971 to 1975). A throbbing
   wind-like sound is created by Waters vibrating the strings of his bass
   guitar with a steel slide and feeding the signal through a [77]Binson
   Echorec. The high pitched electronic 'screams', resembling a distorted
   [78]whale song, were discovered by Gilmour when the cables were
   accidentally reversed to his wah pedal.^[79][1] The "choral" sounding
   segment in the middle of the song was created by placing two tape
   recorders in opposite corners of a room; the main chord tapes of the
   song were then fed into one recorder and played back while at the same
   time recording. The other recorder was then also set to play what was
   being recorded; this created a [80]delay between both recordings,
   heavily influencing the structure of the chords while at the same time
   giving it a very "wet" and "echoey" feel.^[81][2] Harmonic "whistles"
   can be heard produced by Wright pulling certain drawbars in and out on
   the Hammond organ. [82]Rooks were added to the music from a tape
   archive recording (as had been done for some of the band's earlier
   songs, including "[83]Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"). The
   2nd half of the song where Gilmour plays muted notes on the guitar over
   Wright's slowly-building organ solo was inspired by the [84]Beach Boys
   song "[85]Good Vibrations".^[86][3] The song concludes with a rising
   [87]Shepard-Risset glissando.

[[88]edit] Early versions

   The piece had its genesis in a collection of musical experiments
   written separately by each band member, referred to as "Nothing, Parts
   1-24". Subsequent tapes of work in progress were labelled "The Son of
   Nothing" and "The Return of the Son of Nothing"; the latter title was
   eventually used to introduce the as-yet unreleased work during its
   first live performances in early 1971.^[89][4]

   During this stage of its development, the song's first verse had yet to
   be finalized. It originally referred to the meeting of two celestial
   bodies, but perhaps because of Waters' increasing concerns that Pink
   Floyd was being pigeonholed as a [90]space rock band, the lyrics were
   rewritten to use underwater imagery instead.

   The title "Echoes" was also subjected to significant revisions before
   and after the release of Meddle: Waters, a devoted [91]football fan,
   proposed that the band call its new piece "We Won [92]the Double" in
   celebration of [93]Arsenal's 1971 victory, and during a 1972 tour of
   Germany he jovially introduced it on two consecutive nights as "Looking
   Through the Knothole in Granny's Wooden Leg" (a reference to [94]The
   Goon Show; the phrase appeared in an episode titled "The 50
   Cure")^[95][5] and "The March of [96]the Dam Busters", respectively.
   ^[97][4]

[[98]edit] Live performances

   The song, then entitled "The Return of the Son of Nothing", was first
   performed in public on April 22, 1971 at the Lads Club in Norwich,
   England, with the unrevised 'planetary' lyrics. These remained in place
   until September of that year, when they were replaced by the more
   familiar '[99]albatross' lyrics. The song was first introduced as
   "Echoes" on the sixth of August, 1971, at a performance in Japan. It
   was a staple of Pink Floyd's live performances from then until 1975 and
   was also played eleven times in 1987, near the beginning of the [100]A
   Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. Most recently, David Gilmour has
   performed the song on his 2006 solo tour.

   Unlike the Atom Heart Mother suite, it was relatively easy for Pink
   Floyd to reproduce "Echoes" onstage (as can be seen in the [101]Live at
   Pompeii film) without requiring additional musicians, though the
   swapping of keyboard sounds during the piece sometimes proved
   problematic in live performances. Originally, Wright would start the
   song by playing his grand piano through a Leslie speaker, then switch
   to the Hammond organ just before the first verse, switch again to the
   Farfisa organ for the re-entry after the 'seagull' middle section, back
   to the Hammond again for the last verse, and finally to piano for the
   outro. This required Roger Waters to provide the piano 'pings' at their
   re-entry after the middle section. The Farfisa was later dropped from
   the band's live keyboard setup and all its parts were played on the
   Hammond instead. The 1987 performances had synthesizers replacing the
   Farfisa. Unlike Pompeii, regular live performances played the song as a
   whole - the bridge between "Part 1" and "Part 2" was simply done by
   Waters stopping the bass riff of the jam section in the former and
   starting to play the wind sounds of the latter. The rest of the band
   would just play quieter and quieter until silent. Live performances
   featured Roger playing his bass for the intro, rather than Gilmour's
   guitar.

   Starting in 1974, the musical arrangement was augmented by backing
   vocals from [102]Venetta Fields and [103]Carlena Williams and saxophone
   solos by [104]Dick Parry added directly after the second verse and at
   the song's finale. All three of these additional artists joined Pink
   Floyd's touring party to take the latter [105]Dark Side of the Moon
   performances, and added their own parts to the remainder of the concert
   (largely because the former artist was reluctant to leave and re-enter
   the stage throughout the show). ^[106][6] The last time the song was
   played by all four members of Pink Floyd was at the concert in
   [107]Knebworth closing their 1975 world tour. During performances given
   by the 'three-man' Pink Floyd in 1987, "Echoes" was played in a much
   shorter form than usual (with Gilmour singing the higher harmonies
   instead of Wright and Wright singing Gilmour's original harmonies). It
   was ultimately dropped from the set (and replaced with "Shine On You
   Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-5)") because Gilmour did not feel 'right' about
   singing the lyrics at the time, and his backing artists played its
   music without the touches of improvisation that make "Echoes" a
   powerfully affecting piece.

   On Gilmour's 2006 tour in support of [108]On An Island, Wright played a
   key part in the touring band, performing the vocals and keyboard parts
   on "Echoes" (he sang in the same pitch as Gilmour originally did (this
   time melding with Gilmour) and Jon Carin singing the higher harmonies
   that Rick originally sang in 1970s performances). This new arrangement
   of the song is close to full-length (Often clocking at 22 minutes at
   the beginning of the tour, later performances even outlengthed the
   studio version by sometimes three minutes.) It also saw the return of
   Rick's Farfisa organ, which was pulled out of storage and brought on
   tour specifically for "Echoes." There is a full performance of Echoes
   on Gilmour's DVD [109]Remember That Night, taken from the Royal Albert
   Hall. This performance clocks in at 22:18. The 2008 Gilmour CD+DVD
   release [110]Live in Gdask also contains a full performance of Echoes,
   this time clocking in at 25 minutes. Following Wright's death in 2008,
   Gilmour appeared on [111]Jools Holland's programme, [112]Later, in
   tribute (Wright had been planning to appear alongside Gilmour, who
   performed [113]Remember a Day) and said that it was very sad but he
   didn't think he would ever perform Echoes again, without Rick.

[[114]edit] Echoes and the 2001: A Space Odyssey synchronization rumours

   Similar to the the [115]Dark Side of the Rainbow effect, it is
   rumoured^[116][7] that "Echoes" synchronizes with [117]Stanley
   Kubrick's 1968 film [118]2001: A Space Odyssey when played concurrently
   with the final segment (entitled "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite").

   "Echoes" was released 3 years after the film and is 23 minutes and 31
   seconds in length, similar to the "Infinite" segment. Sounds in the
   middle part of the song suggest to some listeners the feeling of
   travelling through an alien world. The drone vocalizations heard in the
   final scenes of 2001 seem to match with the discordant bass vibrations
   in the middle of "Echoes" as well the choral glissandos of its finale.
   Some argue that there are moments when the song and film soundtrack are
   nearly indistinguishable. Another notable link occurs during a change
   in scene at precisely the moment when guitar and keyboards crescendo as
   the lyrics re-enter for the final verse. Almost as a bonus, the early
   lyrics contain references to planets, which seems entirely suitable for
   the film's depiction of Jupiter and its moons. [119]Adrian Maben
   re-created this marriage of music and image in his director's cut of
   [120]Live at Pompeii using [121]CGI.

   The members of the band always denied that the synchronization was
   intentional. Furthermore, the technology to play back film in a
   recording studio circa 1971 would have been expensive and difficult for
   the band to acquire. Roger Waters is sometimes quoted as saying that
   the band's failure to contribute music on 2001's official score was his
   "greatest regret"^[122][7].

   The 1973 [123]George Greenough film "Crystal Voyager" concludes with a
   23 minute segment in which the full length of "Echoes" accompanies a
   montage of images shot by Greenough from a camera mounted on his back
   while surfing on his kneeboard.

[[124]edit] Alleged plagiarism

   In interviews promoting [125]Amused to Death, Waters asserted that
   [126]Andrew Lloyd Webber had plagiarized themes from "Echoes" for
   sections of the [127]musical [128]The Phantom of the Opera;
   nevertheless, he decided not to file a lawsuit regarding the matter.

     Yeah, the beginning of that bloody Phantom song is from Echoes.
     *DAAAA-da-da-da-da-da* . I couldn't believe it when I heard it. It's
     the same time signature - it's 12/8 - and it's the same structure
     and it's the same notes and it's the same everything. Bastard. It
     probably is actionable. It really is! But I think that life's too
     long to bother with suing Andrew fucking Lloyd Webber.^[129][8]

   Waters did, however, respond by adding an insulting reference to Webber
   in the song "It's a Miracle" on the Amused to Death album.

[[130]edit] Tribute

   The [131]Beastie Boys' "Gratitude" [132]music video reflects and
   tributes "Echoes" from Live at Pompeii. "Pink Floyd London" is painted
   on the back of the amp when the camera rotates behind the band. There
   are also shots of Leslie rotating speakers.
