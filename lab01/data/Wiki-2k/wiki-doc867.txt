   Edge Hill [44]railway station serves the district of [45]Edge Hill in
   [46]Liverpool, [47]England.

   There have been two stations of that name. The first was located a
   short distance to the southwest of the present station and its remains
   are still visible, although the site is not open to the public.

[[54]edit] The first station

   The first station was located in a deep sandstone cutting, with three
   tunnels at the west end. The largest bore, in the centre, was the
   [55]Wapping Tunnel, a long incline leading to [56]Wapping Dock. The
   goods wagons descended by gravity, but were hauled up by a winding
   engine. When first opened, it was whitewashed, lit by gas, and used as
   a promenade by visitors.

   The tunnel to the north of the central bore was much shorter and
   inclined upwards, leading to the passenger terminal at [57]Crown
   Street. Here the trains descended by gravity to Edge Hill station and
   were wound up into Crown Street. The southern tunnel was originally a
   short length leading nowhere and used as a storage shed: its chief
   purpose was to create a symmetrical appearance. It was later extended
   on a curving incline so that it could pass over the Wapping tunnel and
   join the Crown Street tunnel.

   At the opposite end of the station area were the boilers of a
   stationary steam engine. These were used for the rope-winding
   mechanism. Each formed the base of a fine Moorish Arch. The smoke was
   channelled down rock cut flues to tall chimneys known as the 'Pillars
   of Hercules' on either side of the tunnel facing.

   There were engine sheds and workshops cut into the rock either side of
   the station area, entered by transverse tracks accessed by turnplates.

   The station area was rarely used for passengers, but rather for the
   marshalling of trains and the coupling and uncoupling of locomotives.

[[58]edit] The new station

   The decision to divert passenger traffic, by means of a new branch, to
   [59]Lime Street Station resulted in the construction of a new station.
   Both Crown Street and the old station then became goods stations. Crown
   Street was also used as a coal yard. The new station was opened in
   1836. Again, trains were able to descend to Lime Street by gravity, and
   were rope-hauled by a winding engine up to Edge Hill. However, this
   practice soon became redundant.

[[60]edit] Layout

   The northernmost tunnel is the [61]Waterloo Tunnel, and the southern
   tunnel leads to [62]Lime Street Station. The station consists of two
   island platforms, each with an original building dating from 1836. This
   is therefore one of the oldest still operating railway stations. Though
   the station is staffed, it is somewhat lacking in passenger facilities
   such as shelter and seating. Art exhibitions are held on the approach
   road to the Southern island platform.

   Around 400 yards^[63][1] from the station in the Manchester direction
   is a key junction, where the Merseyrail city lines separate into two.
   One towards Mossley Hill (serving the Southern Liverpool-Manchester
   line and the West Coast Main Line) and one towards Wavertree Tech. Park
   (serving the Wigan and Manchester Airport lines). There is also a
   non-passenger line towards Bootle Oriel Road^[64][2].

[[65]edit] Services

   Edge Hill lies on both the northern and southern routes of the
   [66]Liverpool to Manchester Line from Liverpool Lime Street. There is a
   half-hourly service on the northern branch, with alternate trains to
   [67]Manchester Victoria and [68]Warrington Bank Quay. There is also an
   hourly service on the southern branch to [69]Manchester Oxford Road via
   [70]Warrington Central. All services are operated by [71]Northern Rail.

[[154]edit] Points of interest

   Edge Hill is a haven for [155]rail enthusiasts. There is a large
   freight yard operated by [156]EWS, which mostly sees [157]Class 60
   locomotives, as a change from that company's more ubiquitous [158]Class
   66s. The yards are also home to a number of track maintenance units,
   some of which have not been moved for two decades.
