   Cabergoline (brand names Dostinex and Cabaser), an ergot derivative, is
   a potent [40]dopamine [41]receptor [42]agonist on D2 receptors.^[43][1]
   It also acts on dopamine receptors in [44]lactophilic [45]hypothalamus
   [46]cells to suppress [47]prolactin production in the [48]pituitary
   gland. It is frequently used as a second-line agent in the management
   of [49]prolactinomas when [50]bromocriptine is ineffective.

[[65]edit] History

   Cabergoline was invented by scientists working for the Italian drug
   company Farmitalia-Carlo Erba SpA in [66]Milan in 1981/82, who were
   experimenting with semisynthetic derivatives of the [67]ergot
   alkaloids. Farmitalia-Carlo Erba was acquired by [68]Pharmacia in 1992,
   which in turn was acquired by [69]Pfizer in 2002. The drug was not FDA
   approved until 2002. It went [70]generic in late 2005 following US
   patent expiration.

[[71]edit] Intellectual property

   Farmitalia filed for patent protection of Cabergoline in 1982, and U.S.
   Patent 4,526,892 was granted in July 1985.

[[72]edit] Pharmacokinetics

   Following a single oral [73]dose, resorption of cabergoline from the
   [74]gastrointestinal (GI) tract is highly variable, typically occurring
   within 0.5 to 4 hours. Ingestion with [75]food does not alter its
   absorption rate. [76]Human [77]bioavailability has not been determined
   since the drug is intended for oral use only. In [78]mice and [79]rats
   the absolute bioavailability has been determined to be 30 and 63
   percent, respectively. Cabergoline is rapidly and extensively
   [80]metabolized in the [81]liver and excreted in [82]bile and to a
   lesser extent in [83]urine. All [84]metabolites are less active than
   the parental drug or inactive altogether. The human elimination
   [85]half-life is estimated to be 63 to 68 hours in patients with
   [86]Parkinson's disease and 79 to 115 hours in patients with
   [87]pituitary [88]tumors. Average elimination [89]half-life is 80h.

[[90]edit] Carcinogenity

   In [91]rodents a dose-dependent increase in [92]malignant tumors has
   been found. The [93]correlation is thought to be [94]species specific.
   No clinical [95]data exists on [96]carcinogenity in
   humans.^[[97]citation needed]

[[98]edit] Uses

     * Monotherapy of [99]Parkinson's disease in the early phase.
     * Combination therapy, together with [100]levodopa and a
       [101]decarboxylase inhibitor such as [102]carbidopa, in
       progressive-phase Parkinson's disease.
     * Adjunctive therapy of prolactin-producing pituitary gland tumors
       ([103]microprolactinomas).
     * In some countries also: [104]ablactation and [105]dysfunctions
       associated with [106]hyperprolactinemia ([107]amenorrhea,
       [108]oligomenorrhea, [109]anovulation, and [110]galactorrhea).

[[111]edit] Off-label/recreational uses

   It has at times been used as an adjunct to [112]SSRI
   [113]antidepressants as there is some evidence that it counteracts
   certain [114]side effects of those [115]drugs, such as reduced
   [116]libido and [117]anorgasmia. It also has been suggested online that
   it has a possible [118]recreational use in reducing or eliminating the
   male [119]refractory period. It is also used by bodybuilders to control
   [120]gynecomastia caused by elevated prolactin levels through the use
   of [121]anabolic steroids such as [122]Nandrolone and [123]Trenbolone.
   Additionally, a study that recently concluded Phase III trials, is
   showing it to decrease the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
   (OHSS) in females undergoing stimulated cycles of [124]in vitro
   fertilization ([125]IVF).

[[126]edit] Contraindications and precautions

     * [127]Hypersensitivity to [128]ergot [129]derivatives
     * [130]Pediatric patients (no clinical experience)
     * Severely impaired liver function or [131]cholestasis
     * [132]Co-medication with drugs metabolized mainly by CYP P450 such
       as [133]erythromycin and [134]ketoconazole, because increased
       [135]plasma levels of cabergoline may result (although cabergoline
       undergoes minimal CYP450 metabolism).
     * Cautions: severe [136]cardiovascular disease, [137]Raynaud's
       disease, [138]gastroduodenal ulcers, active gastrointestinal
       bleeding, [139]hypotension.

[[140]edit] Pregnancy and lactation

     * [141]Pregnancy: Approximately 100 female patients became pregnant
       under therapy with cabergoline for hyperprolactinemic conditions.
       The incidence of [142]spontaneous abortions and [143]congenital
       abnormalities was comparable to nontreated patients. Nevertheless,
       women wishing to become pregnant should wait a period of four weeks
       after discontinuation of cabergoline. Patients becoming pregnant
       under therapy should terminate cabergoline immediately, if
       possible.
     * [144]Lactation: In rats cabergoline was found in the maternal
       [145]milk. Since it is not known if this effect also occurs in
       humans, breastfeeding women should not be treated.

[[146]edit] Side effects

   Approximately 200 patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease
   participated in a [147]clinical study of cabergoline monotherapy.
   Seventy-nine (79) percent reported at least one side effect. These side
   effects were chiefly mild or moderate:
     * GI tract: Side effects were extremely frequent. Fifty-three percent
       of patients reported side effects. Very frequent: [148]Nausea
       (30%), [149]obstipation (22%), and dry mouth (10%). Frequent:
       Gastric irritation (7%), [150]vomiting (5%), and [151]dyspepsia
       (2%).
     * [152]Psychiatric disturbances and [153]central nervous system
       (CNS): Altogether 51 percent of patients were affected. Very
       frequent: Sleep disturbances ([154]somnolence 18%, [155]insomnia
       11%), [156]vertigo (27%), and [157]depression (13%). Frequent:
       [158]dyskinesia (4%) and [159]hallucinations (4%).
     * Cardiovascular: Approximately 30 percent of patients experienced
       side effects. Most frequent were hypotension (10%), peripheral
       [160]edema (14%) and non-specific edema (2%). [161]Arrhythmias were
       encountered in 4.8%, [162]palpitations in 4.3%, and [163]angina
       pectoris in 1.4%.

   In a combination study with 2,000 patients also treated with levodopa,
   the incidence and severity of side effects was comparable to
   monotherapy. Encountered side effects required a termination of
   cabergoline treatment in 15% of patients. Additional side effects were
   infrequent cases of [164]hematological side effects, and an occasional
   increase in liver [165]enzymes or [166]serum [167]creatinine without
   [168]signs or [169]symptoms.

   As with other ergot derivatives, [170]pleuritis, [171]exudative pleura
   disease, pleura [172]fibrosis, [173]lung fibrosis, and
   [174]pericarditis are seen. These side effects are noted in less than
   2% of patients. They require immediate termination of treatment.
   Clinical improvement and [175]normalization of [176]X-ray findings are
   normally seen soon after cabergoline [177]withdrawal.

   The reported [178]incidence and [179]severity of side effects in
   hyperprolactinemic patients was comparable.

[[180]edit] Valvular heart disease

   In two studies published in the [181]New England Journal of Medicine on
   January 4, 2007, cabergoline was implicated along with [182]pergolide
   in causing [183]valvular heart disease.^[184][2]^[185][3] Both drugs
   are ergot-derived [186]dopamine agonists, although their molecular
   skeletons are different. As a result of this, the [187]FDA removed
   pergolide from the U.S. market on March 29, 2007.^[188][4] Since
   cabergoline is not approved in the U.S. for Parkinson's Disease, but
   for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market. The lower doses
   required for treatment of hyperprolactinemia have been found to be not
   associated with clinically significant valvular heart disease or
   cardiac valve regurgitation.^[189][5]^[190][6]

[[191]edit] Interactions

   No [192]interactions were noted with levodopa or [193]selegiline. The
   drug should not be combined with other ergot derivatives. Dopamine
   [194]antagonists such as [195]antipsychotics and [196]metoclopramide
   inhibit the clinical action of cabergoline and should therefore not be
   used concomitantly. The use of [197]antihypertensive drugs should be
   intensively monitored because excessive hypotension may result from the
   combination.

[[198]edit] Dosage

     * Parkinson's disease: Monotherapy: Initial dose should be 0.5 mg
       daily. The usual maintenance dose is 2 to 4 mg daily. Combination
       therapy: Usually 2 to 6 mg daily.
     * Tumors of the pituitary gland and other hyperprolactinemic
       conditions: Initially 0.5 mg per week, slowly titrated to 4.5 mg
       per week, if necessary.
     * Ablactation: According to specific treatment scheme.
