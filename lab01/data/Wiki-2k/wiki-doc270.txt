   In [13]software engineering, a double-chance function is a software
   [14]design pattern with a strong application in [15]cross-platform and
   scalable development. It is easiest to explain it with an example.

   Consider a graphics [16]API with functions to DrawPoint, DrawLine, and
   DrawSquare. It is easy to see that DrawLine can be implemented solely
   in terms of DrawPoint, and DrawSquare can in turn be implemented
   through four calls to DrawLine. If you were porting this API to a new
   architecture you would have a choice: implement three different
   functions natively (taking more time, but ultimately providing a better
   solution), or write DrawPoint natively, and implement the others as
   described above using common, cross-platform, code.

   The double-chance function is an optimal method of creating such an
   implementation, whereby the first draft of the port can use the "fast
   to market, slow to run" version with a common DrawPoint function, while
   later versions can be modified as "slow to market, fast to run". Where
   the double-chance pattern scores high is that the base API includes the
   self-supporting implementation given here as part of the null driver,
   and all other implementations are extensions of this. Consequently the
   first port is, in fact, the first usable implementation.

   One typical implementation in [17]C++ could be:
class CBaseGfxAPI {
    virtual void DrawPoint(int x, int y) = 0; /* Abstract concept for the null d
river */
    virtual void DrawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) { /* DrawPoint() repea
ted */}
    virtual void DrawSquare(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) { /* DrawLine() repe
ated */}
};

class COriginalGfxAPI : public CBaseGfxAPI {
    virtual void DrawPoint(int x, int y) { /* The only necessary native calls */
 }
    virtual void DrawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) { /* If this function
exists a native DrawLine
                                                               routine will be u
sed. Otherwise the base
                                                               implementation is
 run. */}
};

class CNewGfxAPI : public CBaseGfxAPI {
    virtual void DrawPoint(int x, int y) { /* The only necessary for native call
s */ }
};

   Note that the CBaseGfxAPI::DrawPoint function is never used, per se, as
   any graphics call goes through one of its derived classes. So a call to
   CNewGfxAPI::DrawSquare would have its first chance to render a square
   by the CNewGfxAPI class. If no native implementation exists, then the
   base class is called, at which point the [18]virtualization takes over
   and means that CNewGfxAPI::DrawLine is called. This gives the
   CNewGfxAPI class a second chance to use [19]native code, if any is
   available.

   With this method it is, theoretically, possible to build an entire 3D
   engine (applying [20]software rasterizing) using only one native
   function in the form of DrawPoint, with other functions being
   implemented as and when time permits. In practise this would be
   hopelessly slow, but it does demonstrate the possibilities for
   double-chance functions.
