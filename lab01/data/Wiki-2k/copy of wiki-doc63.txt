   Dmitry Kozak

   Dmitry Nikolayevich Kozak ([12]Russian: ) (b. [13]November 7, [14]1958
   in [15]Kirovograd, [16]Ukrainian SSR), is a Russian politician. On
   September 24, 2007 he was appointed to the new Russian cabinet headed
   by [17]Viktor Zubkov as a Russian regional development
   minister.^[18][1] Up to that point, he served as a special
   representative of the Russian president in the Southern Federal
   District ([19]North Caucasus and southern European Russia).

   Dmitry Kozak is known as a close ally of President [20]Vladimir Putin
   and one of the key figures in the presidential team. During the
   [21]2004 Russian election he was official head of Vladimir Putins
   election team.

   Dmitry Kozak graduated from [22]Leningrad State University in [23]1985
   with a degree in law. He worked as a public prosecutor in Leningrad and
   after the collapse of the Soviet Union held various offices in the
   citys administration mostly in a legal department. In 1998 became
   vice-governor of [24]Saint-Petersburg.

   In [25]1999 together with some other officials from this city entered
   Putins government. He held the post of the Chief of Staff from [26]1999
   to [27]2000. Dmitry Kozak became a Deputy Head of the [28]Presidential
   Administration and remained in this position under various titles until
   [29]2004. In [30]2003 he briefly entered international politics and
   unsuccessfully attempted to solve the conflict between [31]Transnistria
   and [32]Moldova (see [33]Kozak memorandum).

   In September 2004 Dmitry Kozak was appointed Presidential
   Plentipotenitary envoy to the [34]Southern Federal District instead of
   [35]Vladimir Yakovlev. On September 24, 2007 he was appointed to the
   new Russian cabinet headed by [36]Viktor Zubkov as Russian regional
   development minister, succeeding Vladimir Yakovlev again, and left the
   previous position. On October 14, 2008 he became deputy prime minister
   of Russia.

   Dmitry Kozak is married and has two sons. It was at times suggested
   that he might become President Putin's successor.
