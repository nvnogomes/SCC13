Dorothy Wadham

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Dorothy Wadham (ne Petre) (1534/1535 1618), was the wife of [8]Nicholas
   Wadham and, as his widow, the founder of [9]Wadham College, Oxford.

   Wadham was the second and eldest surviving child of [10]Sir William
   Petre, a civil and canon lawyer serving [11]King Henry VIII, and his
   wife, Gertrude, daughter of Sir John Tyrrell. Her portrait in Wadham
   College gives her age as sixty in 1595. When Wadham's mother died on
   [12]May 28, [13]1541, she was brought up by Petre's second wife, Anne,
   who was also a Tyrrell by her first marriage. Later in life her writing
   skill and knowledge of Latin was evident and it is likely she was
   educated at her home, [14]Ingatestone Hall, Essex. On [15]September 3,
   [16]1555 she married Nicholas Wadham at St Botolph, [17]Aldersgate,
   London.

   The couple lived at Nicholas' family home in Merrifield, near
   [18]Ilton, [19]Somerset and produced no children. Nicholas died on
   [20]October 20, [21]1609, and between 161213 Wadham had her armoury
   confiscated and was suspected of [22]recusancy. In 1615 she was granted
   a formal pardon under the 1593 act against Popish recusants.

   Dorothy was the sole executor of Nicholas' will, which stated the money
   was "for such uses and purposes" he had "requested her and she hath
   assented to". His wishes included founding a college in [23]Oxford,
   which she did, noting "it would greatly offend my conscience to violate
   any jot of my husband's will". On his deathbed, Nicholas had summoned
   Sir John Davis to discuss his plans with Dorothy and their two men of
   business. Nicholas was persuaded by Davis to sign an instrument naming
   him jointly responsible with Dorothy for pursuing his plans for a
   college. Davis had been convicted as a traitor because of his part in
   the [24]Essex conspiracy, and a recusant. His inclusion in the designs
   put the plan in jeopardy, in 1610 it was shown in parliament that he
   still refused the [25]Church of England sacraments and may have wanted
   Wadham's foundation to be governed by his former college,
   [26]Gloucester Hall. Dorothy wrote to the [27]Lord High Treasurer,
   [28]Robert Cecil a month after Nicholas' death, denying Davis's
   accusation that she did not intend to proceed with Nichola's plans. An
   offer was made to Gloucester Hall, which was refused by the principal
   unless he was made head of the new foundation. Nicholas had intended an
   offer be made to [29]Jesus College, but no evidence of such exists.

   A site was acquired in February 1610 and the architect [30]William
   Arnold was commissioned for its construction. A letter from [31]King
   James I to [32]Oxford City Council persuaded them to lower the asking
   price. Wadham managed to loosen Davis' ties with a [33]collusive suit
   in chancery in July 1610, which established a trust excluding him, her
   brother John Petre was key in raising the support at Westminster but
   Wadham refused his offer of taking over the responsibility "which my
   dear husband so solely and absolutely trusted me with". On [34]December
   20, [35]1610 Wadham College received its royal [36]letters patent, and
   statutes were drafted and approved by Wadham in 1612. The college was
   formally instituted in April 1613. The appointment of the warden,
   fellows, and scholars, and even on occasion the college cook, rested
   with Wadham, as outlined in a series of letters written by her man of
   business, John Arnold, and signed by her, as were the drafts of the
   statutes. Wadham never visited the college and relied in large on
   Arnold. Wadham died on [37]May 16, [38]1618, at the Wadham dower house,
   Edge Manor, in [39]Branscombe, [40]Devon, her body was taken to
   Merrifield and buried on June 16 with her husband in St Mary's Church,
   [41]Ilminster.
