Divergent series

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   In [8]mathematics, a divergent series is an [9]infinite series that is
   not [10]convergent, meaning that the infinite [11]sequence of the
   [12]partial sums of the series does not have a [13]limit.

   If a series converges, the individual terms of the series must approach
   zero. Thus any series in which the individual terms do not approach
   zero diverges. However, convergence is a stronger condition: not all
   series whose terms approach zero converge. The simplest counter example
   is the [14]harmonic series

          1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} +
          \cdots =\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}.

   The divergence of the harmonic series was elegantly proven ([15]here)
   by the medieval mathematician [16]Nicole Oresme.

   In specialized mathematical contexts, values can be usefully assigned
   to certain series whose sequence of partial sums diverges. A
   summability method or summation method is a [17]partial function from
   the set of sequences of partial sums of series to values. For example,
   [18]Cesro summation assigns [19]Grandi's divergent series

          1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \cdots

   the value ^1/[2]. Cesro summation is an averaging method, in that it
   relies on the [20]arithmetic mean of the sequence of partial sums.
   Other methods involve [21]analytic continuations of related series. In
   [22]physics, there are a wide variety of summability methods; these are
   discussed in greater detail in the article on [23]regularization.

[[33]edit] Theorems on methods for summing divergent series

   A summability method M is [34]regular if it agrees with the actual
   limit on all [35]convergent series. Such a result is called an
   [36]abelian theorem for M, from the prototypical [37]Abel's theorem.
   More interesting and in general more subtle are partial converse
   results, called [38]tauberian theorems, from a prototype proved by
   [39]Alfred Tauber. Here partial converse means that if M sums the
   series , and some side-condition holds, then was convergent in the
   first place; without any side condition such a result would say that M
   only summed convergent series (making it useless as a summation method
   for divergent series).

   The operator giving the sum of a convergent series is [40]linear, and
   it follows from the [41]Hahn-Banach theorem that it may be extended to
   a summation method summing any series with bounded partial sums. This
   fact is not very useful in practice since there are many such
   extensions, [42]inconsistent with each other, and also since proving
   such operators exist requires invoking the [43]axiom of choice or its
   equivalents, such as [44]Zorn's lemma. They are therefore
   nonconstructive.

   The subject of divergent series, as a domain of [45]mathematical
   analysis, is primarily concerned with explicit and natural techniques
   such as [46]Abel summation, [47]Cesro summation and [48]Borel
   summation, and their relationships. The advent of [49]Wiener's
   tauberian theorem marked an epoch in the subject, introducing
   unexpected connections to [50]Banach algebra methods in [51]Fourier
   analysis.

   Summation of divergent series is also related to [52]extrapolation
   methods and [53]sequence transformations as numerical techniques.
   Examples for such techniques are [54]Pad approximants, [55]Levin-type
   sequence transformations, and order-dependent mappings related to
   [56]renormalization techniques for large-order [57]perturbation theory
   in [58]quantum mechanics.

[[59]edit] Properties of summation methods

   Summation methods usually concentrate on the sequence of partial sums
   of the series. While this sequence does not converge, we may often find
   that when we take an [60]average of larger and larger initial terms of
   the sequence, the average converges, and we can use this average
   instead of a limit to evaluate the sum of the series. So in evaluating
   a = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + ..., we work with the sequence s, where s[0] =
   a[0] and s[n+1] = s[n] + a[n]. In the convergent case, the sequence s
   approaches the limit a. A summation method can be seen as a function
   from a set of sequences of partial sums to values. If A is any
   summation method assigning values to a set of sequences, we may
   mechanically translate this to a series-summation method A^ that
   assigns the same values to the corresponding series. There are certain
   properties it is desirable for these methods to possess if they are to
   arrive at values corresponding to limits and sums, respectively.
    1. Regularity. A summation method is regular if, whenever the sequence
       s converges to x, A(s) = x. Equivalently, the corresponding
       series-summation method evaluates A^(a) = x.
    2. Linearity. A is linear if it is a linear functional on the
       sequences where it is defined, so that A(r + s) = A(r) + A(s) and
       A(ks) = k A(s), for k a scalar (real or complex.) Since the terms
       a[n] = s[n+1] s[n] of the series a are linear functionals on the
       sequence s and vice versa, this is equivalent to A^ being a linear
       functional on the terms of the series.
    3. Stability. If s is a sequence starting from s[0] and s is the
       sequence obtained by omitting the first value and subtracting it
       from the rest, so that s[n] = s[n+1] s[0], then A(s) is defined if
       and only if A(s) is defined, and A(s) = s[0] + A(s). Equivalently,
       whenever a[n] = a[n+1] for all n, then A^(a) = a[0] + A^(a).

   The third condition is less important, and some significant methods,
   such as [61]Borel summation, do not possess it.

   A desirable property for two distinct summation methods A and B to
   share is consistency: A and B are [62]consistent if for every sequence
   s to which both assign a value, A(s) = B(s). If two methods are
   consistent, and one sums more series than the other, the one summing
   more series is stronger.

   It should be noted that there are powerful numerical summation methods
   that are neither regular nor linear, for instance nonlinear
   [63]sequence transformations like [64]Levin-type sequence
   transformations and [65]Pad approximants, as well as the
   order-dependent mappings of perturbative series based on
   [66]renormalization techniques.

[[67]edit] Axiomatic methods

   Taking regularity, linearity and stability as axioms, it is possible to
   sum many divergent series by elementary algebraic manipulations. For
   instance, whenever r 1, the [68]geometric series

          \begin{align} G(r,c) & = \sum_{k=0}^\infty cr^k & & \\ & = c +
          \sum_{k=0}^\infty cr^{k+1} & & \mbox{ (stability) } \\ & = c + r
          \sum_{k=0}^\infty cr^k & & \mbox{ (linearity) } \\ & = c + r \,
          G(r,c), & & \mbox{ whence } \\ G(r,c) & = \frac{c}{1-r} , & & \\
          \end{align}

   can be evaluated regardless of convergence. More rigorously, any
   summation method that possesses these properties and which assigns a
   finite value to the geometric series must assign this value. However,
   when r is a real number larger than 1, the partial sums increase
   without bound, and averaging methods assign a limit of .

[[69]edit] Nrlund means

   Suppose p[n] is a sequence of positive terms, starting from p[0].
   Suppose also that

          \frac{p_n}{p_0+p_1 + \cdots + p_n} \rightarrow 0.

   If now we transform a sequence s by using p to give weighted means,
   setting

          t_m = \frac{p_m s_0 + p_{m-1}s_1 + \cdots + p_0
          s_m}{p_0+p_1+\cdots+p_m}

   then the limit of t[n] as n goes to infinity is an average called the
   [70]Nrlund mean N[p](s).

   The Nrlund mean is regular, linear, and stable. Moreover, any two
   Nrlund means are consistent. The most significant of the Nrlund means
   are the Cesro sums. Here, if we define the sequence p^k by

          p_n^k = {n+k-1 \choose k-1} = \frac{\Gamma(n+k)}{\Gamma(k)}

   then the Cesro sum C[k] is defined by C[k](s) = N[(p^k)](s). Cesro sums
   are Nrlund means if k 0, and hence are regular, linear, stable, and
   consistent. C[0] is ordinary summation, and C[1] is ordinary [71]Cesro
   summation. Cesro sums have the property that if h > k, then C[h] is
   stronger than C[k].

[[72]edit] Abelian means

   Suppose = {[0], [1], [2], } is a strictly increasing sequence tending
   towards infinity, and that [0] 0. [73]Recall that a[n] = s[n+1] s[n] is
   the associated series whose partial sums form the sequence s. Suppose

          f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \exp(-\lambda_n x)

   converges for all positive real numbers x. Then the Abelian mean A[] is
   defined as

          A_\lambda(s) = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} f(x).

   A series of this type is known as a [74]generalized Dirichlet series;
   in applications to physics, this is known as the method of
   [75]heat-kernel regularization.

   Abelian means are regular, linear, and stable, but not always
   consistent between different choices of . However, some special cases
   are very important summation methods.

[[76]edit] Abel summation

   If [n] = n, then we obtain the method of Abel summation. Here

          f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \exp(-nx) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n
          z^n,

   where z = exp(x). Then the limit of (x) as x approaches 0 through
   positive reals is the limit of the power series for &fnfo;(z) as z
   approaches 1 from below through positive reals, and the Abel sum A(s)
   is defined as

          A(s) = \lim_{z \rightarrow 1^{-}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n.

   Abel summation is interesting in part because it is consistent with but
   more powerful than Cesro summation: A(s) = C[k](s) whenever the latter
   is defined. The Abel sum is therefore regular, linear, stable, and
   consistent with Cesro summation.

[[77]edit] Lindelf summation

   If [n] = n ln(n), then (indexing from one) we have

          f(x) = a_1 + a_2 2^{-2x} + a_3 3^{-3x} + \cdots .

   Then L(s), the Lindelf sum, is the limit of (x) as x goes to zero. The
   Lindelf sum is a powerful method when applied to power series among
   other applications, summing power series in the [78]Mittag-Leffler
   star.

   If g(z) is analytic in a disk around zero, and hence has a
   [79]Maclaurin series G(z) with a positive radius of convergence, then
   L(G(z)) = g(z) in the Mittag-Leffler star. This is defined by taking
   rays from the origin out to any singularity, and removing the
   singularity and anything beyond it on the ray from the complex plane.
   L(G(z)) therefore extends the definition of G(z) as far as it can be
   extended without running into the possibility (if the singularity is a
   [80]branch point) of multiple values.
