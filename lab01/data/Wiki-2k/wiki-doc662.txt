Logical biconditional

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]EQV)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   In [9]logic and [10]mathematics, logical biconditional (sometimes also
   known as the material biconditional) is a [11]logical operator
   connecting two statements to assert, p [12]if and only if q where p is
   a [13]hypothesis (or antecedent) and q is a [14]conclusion (or
   consequent). The operator is denoted using a doubleheaded arrow "", an
   equality sign "=", an equivalence sign "", or EQV. It is logically
   equivalent to (p q) (q p), or the [15]XNOR boolean operator. It is
   equivalent to "(not p or q) and (not q or p)". It is also logically
   equivalent to "(not p and not q) or (p and q)".

   The hypothesis is sometimes also called "sufficient condition" while
   the conclusion may be called "necessary condition".

   The only difference from [16]material conditional is the case when the
   hypothesis is false but the conclusion is true. In that case, in the
   conditional, the result is true, yet in the biconditional the result is
   false.

   In the conceptual interpretation, a = b means "All a 's are b 's and
   all b 's are a 's"; in other words, the sets a and b coincide: they are
   identical. This does not mean that the concepts have the same meaning.
   Examples: "triangle" and "trilateral", "equiangular triangle" and
   "equilateral triangle". The antecedent is the subject and the
   consequent is the predicate of a universal [17]affirmative
   [18]proposition.

   In the propositional interpretation, a b means that a implies b and b
   implies a; in other words, that the propositions are equivalent, that
   is to say, either true or false at the same time. This does not mean
   that they have the same meaning. Example: "The triangle ABC has two
   equal sides", and "The triangle ABC has two equal angles". The
   antecedent is the premise or the cause and the consequent is the
   consequence. When an implication is translated by a hypothetical (or
   conditional) judgment the antecedent is called the hypothesis (or the
   condition) and the consequent is called the thesis.

   A common way of demonstrating a biconditional is to use its equivalence
   to the conjunction of two converse [19]conditionals, demonstrating
   these separately.

   When both members of the biconditional are propositions, it can be
   separated into two conditionals, of which one is called a theorem and
   the other its reciprocal.^[[20]citation needed] Thus whenever a theorem
   and its reciprocal are true we have a biconditional. A simple theorem
   gives rise to an implication whose antecedent is the hypothesis and
   whose consequent is the thesis of the theorem.

   It is often said that the hypothesis is the [21]sufficient condition of
   the thesis, and the thesis the [22]necessary condition of the
   hypothesis; that is to say, it is sufficient that the hypothesis be
   true for the thesis to be true; while it is necessary that the thesis
   be true for the hypothesis to be true also. When a theorem and its
   reciprocal are true we say that its hypothesis is the [23]necessary and
   sufficient condition of the thesis; that is to say, that it is at the
   same time both cause and consequence.

[[33]edit] Definition

   [34]Logical equality (also known as biconditional) is an [35]operation
   on two [36]logical values, typically the values of two
   [37]propositions, that produces a value of true if and only if both
   operands are false or both operands are true.

[[38]edit] Truth table

   The truth table for p EQ q (also written as p = q, p q, or p q) is as
   follows:
   p q
   T T T
   T F F
   F T F
   F F T

[[39]edit] Venn diagram

   The [40]Venn Diagram of "A if and only if B" (red areas are true)

[[41]edit] Properties

     * [42]associativity: ((a \leftrightarrow b) \leftrightarrow c)
       \leftrightarrow (a \leftrightarrow (b \leftrightarrow c))

     * [43]commutativity: (a \leftrightarrow b) \leftrightarrow (b
       \leftrightarrow a)

     * [44]reflexivity: a \leftrightarrow a

     * truth-preserving: The interpretation under which all variables are
       assigned a truth value of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true'
       as a result of logical biconditional.

     * [45]linear

[[46]edit] Rules of Inference

   Like all connectives in first-order logic, the biconditional has rules
   of inference that govern its use in formal proofs.

[[47]edit] Biconditional Introduction

   [48]Biconditional introduction allows you to infer that, if B follows
   from A, and A follows from B, then A [49]if and only if B.

   For example, from the statements "if I'm breathing, then I'm alive" and
   "if I'm alive, then I'm breathing", it can be inferred that "I'm
   breathing if and only if I'm alive".
 B  A
 A  B
   A  B

[[50]edit] Biconditional Elimination

   Biconditional elimination allows one to infer a [51]conditional from a
   biconditional: if ( A B ) is true, then one may infer one direction of
   the biconditional, ( A B ) and( B A ).

   For example, if it's true that I'm breathing [52]if and only if I'm
   alive, then it's true that if I'm breathing, I'm alive; likewise, it's
   true that if I'm alive, I'm breathing.

   Formally:
 ( A  B )
  ( A  B )

   also
 ( A  B )
  ( B  A )

[[53]edit] Colloquial usage

   The only unambiguous way of stating a biconditional in plain English is
   of the form "b if a and a if b". Slightly more formal, one would say "b
   implies a and a implies b". The plain English "if'" may sometimes be
   used as a biconditional. One must weigh context heavily.

   For example, "I'll buy you an ice cream if you pass the exam" is meant
   as a biconditional, since the speaker doesn't intend a valid outcome to
   be buying the ice cream whether or not you pass the exam (as in a
   conditional). However, "it is cloudy if it is raining" is not meant as
   a biconditional, since it can obviously be cloudy while not raining.
