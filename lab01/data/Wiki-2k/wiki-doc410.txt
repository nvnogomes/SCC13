   Drbak is an [32]unincorporated [33]city and the centre of the
   municipality of [34]Frogn, in [35]Akershus county, [36]Norway. The city
   is located along the [37]Oslofjord, and has 13,358 inhabitants.

   Drbak was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see
   [38]formannskapsdistrikt). It was merged with [39]Frogn January 1,
   1962.

   Traditionally, Drbak was the winter harbour of Norway's capital,
   [40]Oslo, since in severe winters the fjord will freeze from outside
   Drbak all the way up to Oslo. It had a city status between 1842 and
   1962, upon which point the municipality was merged into the rural
   municipality Frogn and lost its city status. The city status was
   regained by the municipality council on 13 February 2006. It was also
   decided that adjacent villages such as [41]Heer would be included
   within the city.

   A notable event in Drbak's history is the [42]World War II sinking of
   the [43]German cruiser Blcher in the Drbak narrows, on the early
   morning of 9 April 1940. The cruiser was transporting German soldiers
   and bureaucrats for the planned swift occupation of Oslo, but the
   sinking by the [44]Oscarsborg fortress delayed this, and thus allowed
   for the evacuation of the [45]Norwegian Royal Family, [46]parliament,
   and cabinet, and for the nation's gold reserves to be denied the
   occupiers.

   Early Drbak had ferries that crossed the fjord, in modern times they
   have largely been replaced by an underwater tunnel. However, some of
   the old ferries are still used as "floating restaurants" during the
   summer.

   In summertime, [47]cruise ships visit Oslo almost every day. Often, as
   many as four or five cruise ships visit each day, in addition to all
   the regular traffic, it has made Drbak a popular sea-side tourist spot.
   However, the numerous restaurants, art galleries and mild summers is
   probably more important factors for visiting tourists.

   Drbak is also known for its many art galleries. The town has
   [48]Christmas shop called [49]Julehuset (the Christmas house), and
   letters often end up in Drbak from [50]Europe similarly to how they end
   up in [51]Santa Claus, Indiana in the [52]United States.

   Also, [53]Norsk Luftambulanse is headquartered in Drbak.

[[54]edit] The name

   The [55]Norse form of the name was Drjgbakki. The first element is
   drjgr 'hard; long', the last element is bakki m '(up)hill'. This is
   related to the very steep hills upon which main road into Drbak Center
   winds.
