   Dr. Edward C. Harris, [15]MBE, [16]JP, [17]FSA is a prominent
   [18]Bermudian [19]archaeologist.
   Dr Edward Cecil Harris

   Harris is most famous for his [20]Harris matrix, developed in February
   1973 and considered by some to be the "industry standard" for
   stratigraphic archaeology. This was followed by a five-year
   investigation into archaeological practices. He determined that the
   methods did not properly account for stratigraphy, and published his
   findings in 1979 as the Principles of Archaeological Stratigraphy.

   While attending [21]Columbia University School of General Studies in
   the [22]United States, Harris spent the summers assisting on
   archaeological digs in [23]Winchester, England. After graduating, he
   continued his archaeological work, including in [24]Bergen, Norway and
   along the [25]Persian Gulf. In 1997 he worked towards a [26]PhD through
   the [27]University of London, while working on excavations in [28]New
   Guinea.

   In 1982, Harris became a Fellow of the [29]Society of Antiquaries of
   London, and in 1991 he became a Fellow at the [30]John Carter Brown
   Library at [31]Brown University.

   Outside of academia, Harris has been awarded the Palmetto Award by the
   [32]Bermuda National Trust, for his efforts in the historical
   preservation of several buildings in 1994.

   In Bermuda, Harris serves as the executive director of the [33]Bermuda
   Maritime Museum, and writes a history column, entitled "Heritage
   Matters", for the local newspaper. He is a frequent contributor to the
   annual [34]Bermuda Journal of Archaeology and Maritime History, and has
   served as its editor.
