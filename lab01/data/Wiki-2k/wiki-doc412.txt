   This article is about the suffix -phobia. For the class of
   psychological disorders, see [14]Phobia.

   The [15]English suffixes -phobia, -phobic, -phobe (of [16]Greek origin:
   / ) occur in technical usage in [17]psychiatry to construct words that
   describe irrational, disabling [18]fear as a mental disorder (e.g.,
   [19]agoraphobia), in [20]chemistry to describe chemical aversions
   (e.g., [21]hydrophobic), in [22]biology to describe organisms that
   dislike certain conditions (e.g., [23]acidophobia), and in [24]medicine
   to describe hypersensitivity to a stimulus, usually sensory (e.g.,
   [25]photophobia). In common usage they also form words that describe
   dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject. The suffix is
   [26]antonymic to [27]-phil-.

   Many people apply the suffix -phobia inappropriately to mild or
   irrational fears with no serious substance; however, earlier senses
   relate to [28]psychiatry which studies serious phobias which disable a
   person's [29]life. For more information on the psychiatric side of
   this, including how psychiatry groups phobias as agoraphobia, social
   phobia, or simple phobia, see [30]phobia.

   The following lists include words ending in -phobia, and include fears
   that have acquired names. In many cases people have coined these words
   as [31]neologisms, and only a few of them occur in the medical
   literature. In many cases, the naming of phobias has become a [32]word
   game, of notable example being a 1998 humorous article published by
   [33]BBC News.^[34][1]

   Note too that no things, substances, or even concepts exist which
   someone, somewhere may not fear, sometimes irrationally so. A list of
   all possible phobias would run into many thousands.

   Most of these terms tack the [35]suffix -phobia onto a Greek word for
   the object of the fear (some use a combination of a [36]Latin root with
   the Greek suffix, which many classicists consider linguistically
   impure).

   In some cases (particularly the less medically-oriented usages), a word
   ending in -phobia may have an [37]antonym with the suffix [38]-phil-,
   e.g., [39]Germanophobe / [40]Germanophile.

[[52]edit] Phobia lists

   A large number of-phobia lists circulate on the Internet, with words
   collected from indiscriminate sources, often copying each other. Also,
   a number of psychiatric websites exist that at the first glance cover a
   huge number of phobias, but in fact use a standard text to fit any
   phobia and reuse it for all unusual phobias by merely changing the
   name. Sometimes it leads to bizarre results, such as suggestions to
   cure "prostitute phobia".^[53][2] Such practice is known as [54]content
   spamming and is used to attract [55]search engines.

[[187]edit] Non-psychological conditions

   The following medical conditions have nothing to do with irrational
   fears. However, each usually has a psychological disorder of the same
   name which is an irrational fear. The behavior of an individual with
   the medical condition can be similar to the behavior of an individual
   with the psychological disorder of the same name (e.g., for both usages
   of [188]Photophobia the person avoids light). The difference in usage
   is that for the medical term there is an underlying physiological
   condition that results in the behavior. For example, with medical
   [189]Photophobia the hypersensitivity to light is sufficient such that
   at some light levels the person experiences pain which they avoid by
   seeking darkness. Removing the physiological cause of the
   hypersensitivity to light results in the person no longer avoiding
   light. With psychological [190]Photophobia the person fears the light
   even though there is no current physiological pain caused by light.
     * [191]Hydrophobia fear of [192]water (a symptom of [193]rabies).
     * [194]Photophobia hypersensitivity to light causing aversion to
       light (a symptom of [195]Meningitis and a common condition of
       [196]migrane headaches).
     * [197]Phonophobia hypersensitivity to sound causing aversion to
       sounds. Common during an alcohol [198]hangover or [199]migrane.
     * [200]Osmophobia hypersensitivity to smells causing aversion to
       odors. Common during pregnancy.

[[201]edit] Biology, chemistry

   [202]Biologists use a number of -phobia/-phobic terms to describe
   predispositions by plants and animals against certain conditions. For
   antonyms, see [203]here.
     * [204]Acidophobia/Acidophobic preference for non-acidic conditions.
     * [205]Heliophobia/Heliophobic aversion to [206]sunlight.
     * [207]Hydrophobia/Hydrophobic a property of being repelled by water.
     * [208]Kosmikophobia fear of cosmic phenomena, such as black holes or
       nebulae
     * [209]Lipophobicity a property of fat rejection
     * [210]Ombrophobia fear of rain
     * [211]Photophobia/Photophobic a negative [212]phototaxis or
       [213]phototropism response.
     * [214]Superhydrophobe the property given to materials that are
       extremely difficult to get wet.
     * [215]Thermophobia/Thermophobic aversion to [216]heat.
     * [217]Xerophobia/Xerophobic aversion to dryness.

[[218]edit] Prejudices and discrimination

   One can readily use the suffix -phobia to coin a term that denotes a
   particular anti-ethnic or anti-demographic sentiment, such as
   [219]Europhobia, [220]Francophobia, [221]Hispanophobia, and
   [222]Indophobia. Often a synonym with the prefix "anti-" already exists
   (e.g., [223]Polonophobia vs. [224]anti-Polonism). See "[225]List of
   anti-ethnic terms" for more examples. Anti-religious sentiments are
   expressed in terms such as [226]Christianophobia and [227]Islamophobia.

   Other prejudices include
     * [228]Biphobia dislike of [229]bisexuals
     * [230]Chemophobia prejudice against artificial substances in favour
       of 'natural' substances.
     * [231]Ephebiphobia fear/dislike of [232]youth.
     * [233]Gerontophobia, [234]Gerascophobia fear of growing old or a
       hatred of the [235]elderly.
     * [236]Heterophobia fear/dislike of [237]heterosexuals.
     * [238]Homophobia aversion to [239]homosexuality or fear of
       homosexuals. (This word has become a common political term, and
       many people interpret it as a [240]slur.)
     * [241]Hoplophobia aversion to [242]firearms or firearms owners. This
       word has also gained a certain political notoriety as a
       [243]dysphemism for "gun control advocate"
     * [244]Lesbophobia fear/dislike of lesbian women
     * [245]Lusophobia fear/dislike of Portuguese people
     * [246]Pedophobia, [247]Pediophobia fear/dislike of children
     * [248]Psychophobia prejudice and discrimination against
       [249]mentally ill
     * [250]Serbophobia fear/dislike of Serbs or Serbia
     * [251]Sinophobia fear or dislike for China, its people, or its
       culture
     * [252]Transphobia fear or dislike of [253]transgender or
       [254]transsexual people.
     * [255]Xenophobia fear or dislike of [256]foreigners

[[257]edit] Jocular and fictional phobias

   This article may contain material [258]not appropriate for an
   encyclopedia. Please discuss this issue on the [259]talk page.
     * Aibohphobia a joke term for the fear of [260]palindromes, which is
       a palindrome itself. The term is a piece of [261]computer humor
       entered into the 1981 [262]The Devil's DP Dictionary^[263][3]
     * [264]Anachrophobia fear of temporal displacement, from a
       [265]Doctor Who novel by Jonathan Morris.
     * [266]Anoraknophobia fear of [267]spiders wearing [268]anoraks: it
       is a [269]portmanteau of "anorak" and "[270]arachnophobia. Used in
       the [271]Wallace and Gromit comic book Anoraknophobia. Also the
       title of an album by [272]Marillion.
     * Arachibutyrophobia fear of [273]peanut butter sticking to the roof
       of the mouth. The word is used by [274]Peter O'Donnell in his 1985
       [275]Modesty Blaise adventure novel [276]Dead Man's
       Handle.^[277][4] It had circulated, unattributed, in the Internet
       for some time until it landed at the [278]CTRN Phobia Clinic
       website: "Working one-on-one with one of our team, with guaranteed
       lifetime elimination of Sticky Peanut Butter Phobia. From $1497 and
       up."
     * Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia fear of long words. Hippopoto-
       "big" due to its allusion to the Greek-derived word
       [279]hippopotamus (though this is derived as hippo- "horse"
       compounded with potam-os "river", so originally meaning "river
       horse"; according to the [280]Oxford English, "hippopotamine" has
       been construed as large since 1847, so this coinage is reasonable);
       -monstr- is from Latin words meaning "monstrous", -o- is a
       noun-compounding vowel; -sesquipedali- comes from "sesquipedalian"
       meaning a long word (literally "a foot and a half long" in Latin),
       -o- is a noun-compounding vowel, and -phobia means "fear". Note:
       This was mentioned on the first episode of [281]Brainiac Series
       Five as one of [282]Tickle's Teasers.
     * Venustraphobia fear of beautiful women, according to a 1998
       [283]humorous article published by [284]BBC News.^[285][1] The word
       is a [286]portmanteau of "[287]Venus trap" and "phobia".
       [288]Venustraphobia is the title of a 2006 [289]album by
       [290]Casbah Club.
