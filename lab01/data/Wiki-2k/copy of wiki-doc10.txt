   Dissociation is an unexpected partial or complete disruption of the
   normal integration of a persons conscious or psychological functioning
   that cannot be easily explained by the person. Dissociation is a mental
   process that severs a connection to a person's thoughts, memories,
   feelings, actions, or sense of identity. ^[11][1] Dissociation is a
   normal response to trauma, and allows the mind to distance itself from
   experiences that are too much for the psyche to process at that time.
   ^[12][2] Dissociative disruptions can affect any aspect of a persons
   functioning.^[13][3]^[14][4]^[15][5]^[16][6] Although some dissociative
   disruptions involve [17]amnesia, the vast majority of dissociative
   events do not.^[18][7] Since dissociations are normally unanticipated,
   they are typically experienced as startling, autonomous intrusions into
   the person's usual ways of responding or functioning. Due to their
   unexpected and largely inexplicable nature, they tend to be quite
   unsettling. Dissociation is often a coping mechanism for survivors of
   trauma.

   Different dissociative disorders have different relationships to
   [19]stress and [20]trauma.^[21][8] [22]Dissociative amnesia and
   [23]fugue states are often triggered by life stresses that fall far
   short of trauma.^[24][9]^[25][10] [26]Depersonalization disorder is
   sometimes triggered by trauma, but may be preceded by only stress, a
   bad drug experience, or no identifiable stress at all.^[27][11]
   Research has consistently shown that DID and one form of dissociative
   disorders - not otherwise specified are characterized by reports of
   extensive childhood trauma, usually [28]child
   abuse.^[29][12]^[30][13]^[31][14]

[[39]edit] History

   The [40]French philosopher and [41]psychiatrist [42]Pierre Janet
   (1859-1947) is considered to be the author of the concept of
   dissociation.^[43][15] Contrary to most current conceptions of
   dissociation, Janet did not believe that dissociation was a
   psychological defense,^[44][16]^[45][17]^[46][18]. Psychological
   [47]defence mechanisms belong to Freud's theory of [48]psychoanalysis,
   not to Janetian psychology. Although dissociation is now typically
   considered to be a defense (usually against extreme stress or trauma),
   Janet never thought this.^[[49]citation needed] Janet claimed that
   dissociation occurred only in persons who had a constitutional weakness
   of mental functioning that led to [50]hysteria when they were
   [51]stressed. Although it is true that many of Janet's [52]case
   histories described traumatic experiences, he never considered
   dissociation to be a defense against those experiences. Quite the
   opposite. Janet insisted that dissociation was a mental or cognitive
   deficit. Accordingly, he considered trauma to be one of many stressors
   that could worsen the already-impaired "mental efficiency" of a
   hysteric, thereby generating a cascade of hysterical (in today's
   language, "dissociative") symptoms. Janet's descriptions of
   dissociation and dissociative symptoms are generally considered to be
   ground-breaking (and much superior to Freud's descriptions of those
   phenomena).^[53][15]^[54][19]^[55][20]^[56][21] Despite this,
   [57]clinicians have routinely preferred Freud's motivational
   explanation of dissociation as a defense against pain or displeasure to
   Janet's explanation that dissociation is due to
   constitutionally-impaired mental efficiency. Clinicians' preference for
   the Freudian explanation is directly reflected in today's most popular
   understanding of dissociation; namely, that dissociation is a defense
   against trauma.

   Although there was great interest in dissociation during the last two
   decades of the nineteenth century (especially in France and England),
   this interest rapidly waned with the coming of the new century
   (Ellenberger, 1970). Even Janet largely turned his attention to other
   matters. On the other hand, there was a sharp peak in interest in
   dissociation in America from 1890 to 1910, especially in Boston as
   reflected in the work of William James, Boris Sidis, Morton Prince, and
   William McDougall. Nevertheless, even in America, interest in
   dissociation rapidly succumbed to the surging academic interest in
   psychoanalysis and behaviorism. For most of the twentieth century,
   there was little interest in dissociation. Discussion of dissociation
   only resumed when Ernest Hilgard (1977) published his neodissociation
   theory in the 1970s and when several authors wrote about multiple
   personality in the 1980s.

   [58]Carl Jung described pathological manifestations of dissociation as
   special or extreme cases of the normal operation of the psyche. This
   structural dissociation, opposing tension, and hierarchy of basic
   [59]attitudes and functions in normal individual consciousness is the
   basis of Jung's [60]Psychological Types.^[61][22] He theorized that
   dissociation is a natural necessity for consciousness to operate in one
   faculty unhampered by the demands of its opposite.

   Attention to dissociation as a clinical feature has been growing in
   recent years as knowledge of [62]post-traumatic stress disorder
   increased, due to interest in [63]dissociative identity disorder and
   the [64]multiple personality controversy, and as [65]neuroimaging
   research and population studies show its relevance.^[66][23]

[[67]edit] Diagnosis

   The [68]DSM-IV considers symptoms such as [69]depersonalization,
   [70]derealization and [71]psychogenic amnesia to be core features of
   [72]dissociative disorders.^[73][24] However, in the normal population
   dissociative experiences that are not clinically significant are highly
   prevalent, with 60% to 65% of the respondents indicating that they have
   had some dissociative experiences.^[74][25] The [75]SCID-D is a
   structured interview used to assess and diagnosis dissociation.

[[76]edit] Relation to trauma and abuse

   Dissociation has been described as one of a constellation of symptoms
   experienced by some victims of multiple forms of childhood trauma,
   including [77]physical abuse and [78]child sexual
   abuse.^[79][26]^[80][27] This is supported by studies which suggest
   that dissociation is correlated with a history of
   trauma.^[81][28]^[82][29]Dissociation appears to have a high
   [83]specificity and low [84]sensitivity to having a self-reported
   history of trauma.^[85][30]

   Symptoms of dissociation resulting from trauma may include
   depersonalization, psychic numbing, disengagement, or amnesia regarding
   the events of the abuse. It has been hypothesized that dissociation may
   provide a temporarily effective defense mechanism in cases of severe
   trauma; however, in the long term, dissociation is associated with
   decreased psychological functioning and adjustment.^[86][27] Other
   symptoms sometimes found along with dissociation in victims of
   traumatic abuse (often referred to as "sequelae to abuse") include
   anxiety, PTSD, low self-esteem, somatization, depression, chronic pain,
   interpersonal dysfunction, substance abuse, self-mutilation and
   suicidal ideation or actions.^[87][31]^[88][27]^[89][26] These symptoms
   may lead the victim to erroneously present the symptoms as the source
   of the problem.^[90][26]

   [91]Child abuse, especially chronic abuse starting at early ages, has
   been related to high levels of dissociative symptoms in a clinical
   sample,^[92][32] including amnesia for abuse memories.^[93][33] A
   non-clinical sample of adult women linked increased levels of
   dissociation to sexually abuse by a significantly older person prior to
   age 15,^[94][34] and dissociation has also been [95]correlated a
   history of childhood physical as well as sexual abuse.^[96][35] When
   sexual abuse is examined, the levels of dissociation were found to
   increase along with the severity of the abuse.^[97][36] The level of
   dissociation has been found to be related to reported overwhelming
   sexual and physical abuse.^[98][36] When severe sexual abuse
   (penetration, several perpetrators, lasting more than one year) had
   occurred, dissociative symptoms were even more prominent.^[99][36] The
   amount of dissociation that follows directly after a trauma predicts
   [100]posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).^[101][29] Individuals that
   are more likely to dissociate during a traumatic event are considerably
   more likely to develop chronic PTSD. ^[102][29] One study found that
   subjects who experienced early and/or recent trauma were more
   dissociative.^[103][37]

[[104]edit] Psychoactive substances

          Main article: [105]Dissociative drug

   [106]Psychoactive drugs can often induce a state of temporary
   dissociation. Substances with dissociative properties include
   [107]ketamine, [108]nitrous oxide, [109]alcohol, [110]tiletamine,
   [111]dextromethorphan, [112]PCP, [113]salvia, [114]muscimol,
   [115]diphenhydramine, [116]atropine, and [117]ibogaine.^[118][38]
