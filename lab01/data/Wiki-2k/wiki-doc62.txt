[[31]edit] Fictional character biography

   Dmitri was born in [32]Kuibyshev, Russia (some sources say Moscow). He
   was a KGB operative, who became the fifth Crimson Dynamo when the KGB
   stripped the previous Crimson Dynamo of his armor and gave it to
   Dmitri. Dmitri was sent to work with the [33]Soviet Super-Soldiers,
   joining with teammates [34]Darkstar and [35]Vanguard. On the team's
   first recorded mission, they went to investigate a signal coming from
   the [36]Blue Area of the Moon, and were shot by [37]Rigellians who
   mistook them for their enemies, the [38]Knights of Wundagore. When
   [39]Jack of Hearts and [40]Iron Man arrived to investigate, the Crimson
   Dynamo thought it was they who had attacked and fought the heroes. When
   the Super-Soldiers received a transmission from their superiors, they
   worked alongside Iron Man and [41]S.H.I.E.L.D. to combat the
   Rigellians. The conflict came to an end when one of the Rigellians'
   Recorders relieved the fleet commander of his command.^[42][1]

   Later, the Super-Soldiers invaded the U.S. to kidnap Dr. Daniel
   Ironwood on behalf of the KGB, to help Nikolai Kutzov build an
   anti-matter bomb, and took his daughter Cissy captive as well. They
   were defeated by [43]Alexi Vazhin, [44]Spider-Man, and [45]Bruce
   Banner.

   Colonel [46]Yuri Brevlov added [47]Ursa Major to the Super-Soldiers'
   ranks and sent them to the site of a nuclear detonation by the
   [48]Presence. When Darkstar teleported them to the site, they
   encountered the Hulk and fought him, though he defeated the whole team.
   The Super-Soldiers discovered that Dmitri was a KGB agent, and expelled
   him from the group.^[49][2]

   Dmitri was later employed as defense at the [50]Doppleganger's
   laboratory in Siberia. Wearing a gigantic version of the Crimson Dynamo
   armor, he fought [51]X-Factor, but was defeated.^[52][3]

   When the other Soviet Super-Soldiers quit working for the Russian
   government, they teamed up with the [53]mutant [54]Gremlin, who was
   using the [55]Titanium Man's power armor. Dmitri convinced them to aid
   him on a mission to investigate the crash of [56]Magneto's [57]Asteroid
   M, although the team no longer trusted him due to his ties with the
   KGB. The [58]X-Men and [59]Avengers found Magneto first, and when they
   refused to turn him over, the Super-Soldiers attacked. Although
   Dmitri's armor was badly damaged by [60]Captain Marvel, the Russians
   again pursued the American heroes. When the X-Men and Avengers revealed
   to the Super-Soldiers that the Crimson Dynamo was responsible for the
   crash in the first place, they turned Dmitri in to the
   authorities.^[61][4]

   Later, the Crimson Dynamo and Titanium Man were informed by the Russian
   government of how Iron Man had been attacking people in power-armor.
   Dmitri was committed to serving the government, but the Gremlin refused
   to co-operate, so the government used him as bait. When Iron Man
   finally did catch up with them, he destroyed the Titanium Man armor
   with the Gremlin inside and wrecked the Crimson Dynamo armor.

   The Crimson Dynamo's armor was repaired, and he joined the [62]Supreme
   Soviets, a group of superhumans who were loyal to the Soviet
   government. Meanwhile, the Soviet Super-Soldiers sought asylum from the
   Russian government at Avengers' headquarters. The Crimson Dynamo, along
   with the Supreme Soviets disguised themselves as members of the
   Avengers, and attacked his former teammates brutally, leaving them for
   dead. The three heroes' spirits took on a "Great Beast" energy form and
   attacked Moscow, and the Supreme Soviets tried to stop the creature but
   were absorbed into it. The dying heroes intended to have revenge by
   killing their assassins, but [63]Captain America convinced them to let
   the others live.^[64][5]

   Colonel-General [65]Valentin Shatalov ordered the Crimson Dynamo to
   recover the original [66]Titanium Man from New York City; Bullski was
   on a mission working with members of the [67]Green Liberation Front,
   who had turned on him. The G.L.F. discovered the Crimson Dynamo's
   mission and attacked him, and he reactivated the Titanium Man, who
   slaughtered the G.L.F. members. The scandal over the massacre allowed
   Colonel-General Valentin Shatalov to use his rank to obtain the Crimson
   Dynamo armor from Dmitri Bukharin for his own use. Dmitri became a
   renegade from the KGB.

   By this time, his former teammates were now calling themselves the
   People's Protectorate. Dmitri told them what happened, and they
   accepted him into the new team as Airstrike, and the rest of the
   Supreme Soviets merged with this team as well.

[[68]edit] Powers and abilities

   As the Crimson Dynamo, Dmitri wore a suit of power-armor designed by
   the Soviet government. This armor grants him superhuman strength and
   durability, flight, hand-blasters, missiles, and radio equipment.

   As Airstrike, he wears a different suit of power-armor. It contains
   wrist-blasters, and presumably affords defense and flight capabilities.

[[70]edit] Days of Future Past

   Dmitri appears in the "[71]Days of Future Past" storyline as the owner
   of a war veterans' bar in [72]Moscow.
