   In [17]Catholicism, a dogmatic definition is an extraordinary
   [18]infallible statement published by a [19]pope or an [20]ecumenical
   council concerning a matter of [21]faith or [22]morals, the belief in
   which the [23]Catholic Church requires of all [24]Christians (although
   Christians who are not Catholic do not recognize the Catholic Church's
   authority in such matters).

   It most often refers to the infallible teaching of a truth believed
   bona fina de fide credenda, meaning one defined as explicitly revealed
   in the deposit of faith and demanding supernatural faith in itself on
   the authority of the Word of God: Public Revelation in Scripture and
   Tradition. Popes and ecumenical councils may also extraordinarily
   infallibly define truths to be held "de fide tenenda," that is to say
   discerned as logically implied or intrinsically connected to the
   deposit of faith and guaranteed as infallible by the Holy Spirit, but
   not necessarily specifically and explicitly Revealed and so demanding
   supernatural faith not in themselves specifically, but as part of the
   faith in the Holy Spirit's guarantee of the infallibility and authority
   of the Church in such matters. The difference is technical; such
   teachings upon further discernment may be advanced to the status of "de
   fide credenda," and denial of either makes one a heretic as they are
   both infallible.

   Contrary to the [25]stereotype that Catholics think that everything
   that the pope says is infallible (or that the pope is impeccable,
   unable to sin), dogmatic definitions by popes are in fact very rare.
   Throughout the entire history of the Church, Papal Infallibility has
   only been invoked, at least unambiguously, twice: [26]Ineffabilis Deus,
   the definition by [27]Pope Pius IX in 1854 concerning the
   [28]Immaculate Conception of [29]Mary, and [30]Munificentissimus Deus,
   the definition by [31]Pope Pius XII in 1950 concerning the
   [32]Assumption of Mary. Beyond these two, theologians disagree on
   which, if any, previous papal declarations may be considered as
   possible examples of extraordinary infallible dogmatic definitions on
   the part of a pope.

   Dogmatic definitions by ecumenical councils, on the other hand, are
   significantly more common throughout history, including, for example,
   the Trinitarian and Christological dogmas of the early councils, the
   teachings on Grace, Justification, and the Sacraments by the
   [33]Council of Trent, and most recently the definition of Papal
   Infallibility itself by [34]Vatican I.

   The Church holds her teachings to be infallible beyond merely those
   doctrines that have been dogmatically defined extraordinarily by a pope
   or ecumenical council. The so-called ordinary and universal
   [35]magisterium of the Church is held to be infallible too, and in fact
   the ordinary manifestation of infallibility. The common consensus of
   the bishops throughout the world and over time is held to be infallible
   regardless of whether a Pope or Council has extraordinarily defined the
   teaching. This is to avoid a [36]positivistic notion of Truth and
   belief. Like extraordinary definitions, the ordinary magisterium may
   propose teachings both de fide credenda and de fide tenenda, and the
   latter may advance to the status of the former, and both are held to be
   infallible. [37]John Paul II, for example, clarified that the
   reservation of ordination to males only is infallible by the
   infallibility of the ordinary magisterium, without going so far as
   issuing a separate extraordinary dogmatic definition. Far from meaning
   that Catholics are thus free to question this teaching, it means that
   it is infallible and unchangeable, demands supernatural faith, and one
   who denies it is a heretic. It has been suggested that the reason that
   John Paul did not simply define it extraordinarily was in order to not
   weaken the understanding that the ordinary magisterium is also
   infallible, to remind Catholics that it is not merely the extraordinary
   definitions that are infallible and irreversible as if doctrine were
   positivistic that it holds "only if the pope says so with a particular
   formula".

[[38]edit] Infallibility in non-Catholic churches

   See Only two times has Papal infallibility been invoked in the last two
   hundred years. The first was actually a Papal bull in 1854. This was
   given before the beginning of the First Vatican Council that defined
   the doctrine of Papal Infallibility. The First Vatican Council
   adjourned in 20 October 1870. The second was given using the Papal
   infallibility Doctrine in 1950.
