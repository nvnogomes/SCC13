   EG&G is a U.S. national [9]defense contractor and provider of
   management and technical services. The company was involved in
   contracting services to the [10]United States government during
   [11]World War II, and conducted weapons research and development after
   the war. Its close involvement with some of the U.S. Government's most
   sensitive technologies has led to it being cited in [12]conspiracy
   theories related to [13]Defense Department [14]black projects, most of
   which related to its core competencies in nuclear technologies.

[[20]edit] History

   In 1931 [21]MIT professor [22]Harold Edgerton (a pioneer of [23]high
   speed photography) partnered with his graduate student [24]Kenneth
   Germeshausen as a small technical consulting firm. The two were joined
   by fellow MIT graduate student [25]Herbert Grier in 1934. [26]Bernard
   ("Barney") O'Keefe became the fourth member of their fledgling
   technology group.

   The group's high-speed photography was used to image [27]implosion
   tests during the [28]Manhattan Project. The same skills in precisely
   timed high power pulses of electricity also formed a key enabling
   technology for nuclear weapon triggers. After the war the group
   continued their association with the burgeoning military nuclear
   effort, and formally incorporated Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier,
   Inc. in 1947.

   During the 1950s and 60s EG&G was heavily involved in [29]nuclear tests
   as a major contractor for the [30]Atomic Energy Commission. EG&G made
   extensive use of the [31]Nevada Test Site for weapons development and
   high-technology military testing, including the [32]SR-71 at [33]Groom
   Lake ([34]Area 51)^[35][1]. EG&G has shared operations responsibility
   for the [36]NTS with [37]Livermore Labs, [38]Raytheon Services Nevada,
   Reynolds Electrical and Engineering (REECO) and others. Subsequently
   EG&G expanded its range of services, providing facilities management,
   technical services, security, and pilot training for the U.S. military
   and other government departments. EG&G builds a variety of sensing,
   detection and imaging products including [39]night vision equipment,
   sensors used to detect nuclear material and chemical and biological
   weapons agents, and a variety of acoustic sensors. The company also
   supplies microwave and electronic components to the government,
   security systems, and systems for electronic warfare and mine
   countermeasures.

   During the 1970s and 80s the company, then led by Barney O'Keefe,
   diversified by acquisition into the fields of paper making, scientific,
   marine, environmental and geophysical instrumentation, automotive
   testing, fans and blowers, frequency control devices and other
   components. In the late '80s and early '90s most of these divisions
   were sold, and on [40]May 28, [41]1999, the non-government side of EG&G
   Inc. (formerly [42]NYSE: [43]EGG) purchased the Analytical Instruments
   Division of [44]Perkin-Elmer for US$425 million, also assuming the
   Perkin-Elmer name.^[45][2]^[46][3] ([47]NYSE: [48]PKI) At the time EG&G
   was based in [49]Wellesley, Massachusetts, and made products for
   diverse industries including automotive, medical, aerospace and
   photography.^[50][3]

   In August 2002 the defense and services sector of the company was
   acquired by defense technical services giant [51]URS Corporation. URS'
   EG&G division is headquartered in [52]Gaithersburg, Maryland and
   employs over 11,000 people. During its heyday in the 1980s EG&G
   employed close to 35,000.

   EG&G is also notable as the operator of [53]Janet Airlines, a small
   fleet of [54]Boeing 737/[55]T-43A passenger jets. The aircraft serve
   the [56]Nevada Test Site (most notably [57]Area 51) from their terminal
   at Las Vegas' [58]McCarran International Airport.

   From 1999 to at least 2001, it was wholly-owned by [59]The Carlyle
   Group, see [60]http://www.carlyle.com/Portfolio/item7169.html,

   EG&G Technical Services, Inc. and [73]Lear Siegler Services, Inc.

   government contractors providing operations and maintenance, systems
   engineering and technical assistance, and program management, primarily
   to the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The companies are
   separate legal entities, but share a common management.
