   [15]Eugenius Warming founded ecology as a scientific discipline

   Ecology (from Greek okos, "house"; -, -logia, study of) is the
   [16]scientific study of the distribution and [17]abundance of [18]life
   and the [19]interactions between [20]organisms and their [21]natural
   [22]environment.^[23][1] The environment of an organism includes
   physical properties, which can be described as the sum of local
   [24]abiotic factors such as [25]insolation (sunlight), [26]climate, and
   geology, and biotic [27]ecosystem, which includes other organisms that
   share its [28]habitat.^[29][2]

   The word "ecology" is often used colloquially in such terms as
   [30]social ecology and [31]deep ecology and in common parlance as a
   synonym for the [32]natural environment or [33]environmentalism.
   Likewise "ecologic" or "ecological" is often taken in the sense of
   [34]environmentally friendly.

   The term ecology or oekologie was coined by the German biologist
   [35]Ernst Haeckel in 1866, when he defined it as "the comprehensive
   science of the relationship of the organism to the
   environment."^[36][3] Haeckel did not elaborate on the concept, and the
   first significant textbook on the subject (together with the first
   university course) was written by the [37]Danish [38]botanist,
   [39]Eugenius Warming. For this early work, Warming is often identified
   as the founder of ecology.^[40][4]

[[58]edit] Scope

   A coral reef near the Hawaiian islands is an example of a complex
   marine ecosystem.

   Ecology is usually considered as a branch of biology, the general
   science that studies living organisms. Organisms can be studied at many
   different levels, from [59]proteins and [60]nucleic acids (in
   [61]biochemistry and [62]molecular biology), to [63]cells (in
   [64]cellular biology), to individuals (in [65]botany, [66]zoology, and
   other similar disciplines), and finally at the level of
   [67]populations, communities, and [68]ecosystems, to the [69]biosphere
   as a whole; these latter strata are the primary subjects of ecological
   inquiry. Ecology is a [70]multidisciplinary science. Because of its
   focus on the higher levels of the organization of [71]life on earth and
   on the interrelations between organisms and their [72]environment,
   ecology draws on many other branches of science, especially geology and
   geography, [73]meteorology, [74]pedology, genetics, chemistry, and
   physics. Thus, ecology is considered by some to be a [75]holistic
   science, one that over-arches older disciplines such as biology which
   in this view become sub-disciplines contributing to ecological
   knowledge. In support of viewing ecology as a subject in its own right
   as opposed to a sub-discipline of biology, [76]Robert Ulanowicz stated
   that "The emerging picture of ecosystem behavior does not resemble the
   worldview imparted by an extrapolation of conceptual trends established
   in other sciences."^[77][5]

   Agriculture, fisheries, forestry, medicine, and urban development are
   among human activities that would fall within Krebs' (1972: 4)
   explanation of his definition of ecology: where organisms are found,
   how many occur there, and why.

   Ecological knowledge such as the quantification of [78]biodiversity and
   [79]population dynamics has provided a scientific basis for expressing
   the aims of [80]environmentalism and evaluating its goals and policies.
   Additionally, a [81]holistic view of nature is stressed in both ecology
   and environmentalism.

   Consider the ways an ecologist might approach studying the life of
   honeybees:
     * The behavioral relationship between individuals of a species is
       behavioral ecologyfor example, the study of the queen bee, and how
       she relates to the worker bees and the drones.
     * The organized activity of a species is community ecology; for
       example, the activity of bees assures the [82]pollination of
       [83]flowering plants. Beehives additionally produce honey which is
       consumed by still other species, such as bears.
     * The relationship between the environment and a species is
       environmental ecologyfor example, the consequences of environmental
       change on bee activity. Bees may die out due to environmental
       changes (see [84]pollinator decline). The environment
       simultaneously affects and is a consequence of this activity and is
       thus intertwined with the survival of the species.

[[85]edit] Disciplines

          Main article: [86]Ecology (disciplines)

   Ecology is a broad discipline comprising many sub-disciplines. A
   common, broad classification, moving from lowest to highest complexity,
   where complexity is defined as the number of entities and processes in
   the system under study, is:
     * [87]Ecophysiology examines how the physiological functions of
       organisms influence the way they interact with the environment,
       both biotic and abiotic.
     * [88]Behavioral ecology examines the roles of behavior in enabling
       an animal to adapt to its environment.
     * [89]Population ecology studies the dynamics of populations of a
       single species.
     * [90]Community ecology (or synecology) focuses on the interactions
       between species within an ecological community.
     * [91]Ecosystem ecology studies the flows of energy and matter
       through the biotic and abiotic components of [92]ecosystems.
     * [93]Systems ecology is an interdisciplinary field focusing on the
       study, development, and organization of ecological systems from a
       [94]holistic perspective.
     * [95]Landscape ecology examines processes and relationship in a
       spatially explicit manner, often across multiple ecosystems or very
       large geographic areas.
     * [96]Evolutionary ecology studies ecology in a way that explicitly
       considers the evolutionary histories of species and their
       interactions.
     * [97]Political ecology connects politics and economy to problems of
       environmental control and ecological change.

   Ecology can also be sub-divided according to the species of interest
   into fields such as [98]animal ecology, plant ecology, [99]insect
   ecology, [100]marine ecology, and so on. Another frequent method of
   subdivision is by [101]biome studied, e.g., [102]Arctic ecology (or
   [103]polar ecology), [104]tropical ecology, [105]desert ecology, etc.
   The primary technique used for investigation is often used to subdivide
   the discipline into groups such as [106]chemical ecology, [107]genetic
   ecology, [108]field ecology, [109]statistical ecology, [110]theoretical
   ecology, and so forth. These fields are not mutually exclusive.

[[114]edit] Levels of organization

   Some of the biodiversity of a [115]coral reef.

   Ecology can be studied at a wide range of levels, from large to small
   scale. These levels of ecological organization, as well as an example
   of a question ecologists would ask at each level, include:
     * [116]Biosphere: " What role does concentration of atmospheric
       [117]carbon dioxide play in the regulation of global
       [118]temperature?"
     * [119]Region: "How has geological history influenced regional
       diversity within certain groups of organisms?"
     * [120]Landscape: "How do vegetated corridors affect the rate of
       movement by mammals among isolated fragments?"
     * [121]Ecosystem: "How does fire affect nutrient availability in
       grassland ecosystems?"
     * [122]Community: "How does disturbance influence the number of
       mammal species in African grasslands?"
     * [123]Interactions: "What evolutionary benefit do zebras gain by
       allowing birds to remove parasites?"
     * [124]Population: "What factors control zebra populations?"
     * [125]Individual: "How do zebras regulate internal water balance?"
          + These levels range from broadest to most specific.^[126][6]

[[127]edit] Biosphere

          Main articles: [128]Biosphere, [129]Biodiversity, and
          [130]Unified neutral theory of biodiversity

   For modern ecologists, ecology can be studied at several levels:
   population level (individuals of the same species in the same or
   similar environment), [131]biocoenosis level (or community of species),
   [132]ecosystem level, and [133]biosphere level.

   The outer layer of the planet Earth can be divided into several
   compartments: the [134]hydrosphere (or sphere of water), the
   [135]lithosphere (or sphere of soils and rocks), and the
   [136]atmosphere (or sphere of the air). The [137]biosphere (or sphere
   of life), sometimes described as "the fourth envelope," is all living
   matter on the planet or that portion of the planet occupied by life. It
   reaches well into the other three spheres, although there are no
   permanent inhabitants of the atmosphere. Relative to the volume of the
   Earth, the biosphere is only the very thin surface layer that extends
   from 11,000 meters below sea level to 15,000 meters above.

   It is thought that life first developed in the hydrosphere, at shallow
   depths, in the [138]photic zone. (Recently, though, a competing theory
   has emerged, that life originated around [139]hydrothermal vents in the
   deeper ocean. See [140]Origin of life.) Multicellular organisms then
   appeared and colonized [141]benthic zones. [142]Photosynthetic
   organisms gradually produced the chemically unstable oxygen-rich
   atmosphere that characterizes our planet. Terrestrial life developed
   later, protected from [143]UV rays by the [144]ozone layer.
   Diversification of terrestrial species is thought to be increased by
   the continents [145]drifting apart, or alternately, colliding.
   Biodiversity is expressed at the ecological level (ecosystem),
   population level (intraspecific diversity), species level (specific
   diversity), and genetic level.

   The biosphere contains great quantities of elements such as
   [146]carbon, [147]nitrogen, [148]hydrogen, and oxygen. Other elements,
   such as [149]phosphorus, [150]calcium, and [151]potassium, are also
   essential to life, yet are present in smaller amounts. At the ecosystem
   and biosphere levels, there is a continual recycling of all these
   elements, which alternate between the mineral and organic states.

   Although there is a slight input of geothermal energy, the bulk of the
   functioning of the ecosystem is based on the input of solar energy.
   Plants and photosynthetic microorganisms convert light into chemical
   energy by the process of [152]photosynthesis, which creates
   [153]glucose (a simple sugar) and releases free oxygen. Glucose thus
   becomes the secondary energy source that drives the ecosystem. Some of
   this glucose is used directly by other organisms for energy. Other
   sugar molecules can be converted to molecules such as [154]amino acids.
   Plants use some of this sugar, concentrated in [155]nectar, to entice
   pollinators to aid them in reproduction.

   [156]Cellular respiration is the process by which organisms (like
   mammals) break the glucose back down into its constituents, water and
   [157]carbon dioxide, thus regaining the stored energy the sun
   originally gave to the plants. The proportion of photosynthetic
   activity of plants and other photosynthesizers to the respiration of
   other organisms determines the specific composition of the Earth's
   atmosphere, particularly its oxygen level. [158]Global air currents mix
   the atmosphere and maintain nearly the same balance of elements in
   areas of intense biological activity and areas of slight biological
   activity.

   Water is also exchanged between the hydrosphere, lithosphere,
   atmosphere, and biosphere in regular [159]cycles. The oceans are large
   tanks that store water, ensure thermal and climatic stability, and
   facilitate the transport of chemical elements thanks to large
   [160]oceanic currents.

   For a better understanding of how the biosphere works, and various
   dysfunctions related to human activity, American scientists attempted
   to simulate the biosphere in a small-scale model, called [161]Biosphere
   II.

[[162]edit] Ecosystem

          Main article: [163]Ecosystem

   The [164]Daintree Rainforest in [165]Queensland, Australia is an
   example of a [166]forest ecosystem.

   A central principle of ecology is that each living organism has an
   ongoing and continual relationship with every other element that makes
   up its environment. The sum total of interacting living organisms (the
   [167]biocoenosis) and their non-living environment (the [168]biotope)
   in an area is termed an ecosystem. Studies of ecosystems usually focus
   on the movement of energy and matter through the system.

   Almost all ecosystems run on energy captured from the sun by
   [169]primary producers via [170]photosynthesis. This energy then flows
   through the food chains to [171]primary consumers ([172]herbivores who
   eat and digest the plants), and on to [173]secondary and [174]tertiary
   consumers (either [175]carnivores or [176]omnivores). Energy is lost to
   living organisms when it is used by the organisms to do [177]work, or
   is lost as [178]waste heat.

   Matter is incorporated into living organisms by the primary producers.
   Photosynthetic plants fix carbon from [179]carbon dioxide and nitrogen
   from atmospheric nitrogen or nitrates present in the soil to produce
   amino acids. Much of the carbon and nitrogen contained in ecosystems is
   created by such plants, and is then consumed by secondary and tertiary
   consumers and incorporated into themselves. Nutrients are usually
   returned to the ecosystem via [180]decomposition. The entire movement
   of chemicals in an ecosystem is termed a [181]biogeochemical cycle, and
   includes the [182]carbon and [183]nitrogen cycle.

   Ecosystems of any size can be studied; for example, a rock and the
   plant life growing on it might be considered an ecosystem. This rock
   might be within a plain, with many such rocks, small grass, and grazing
   animals -- also an ecosystem. This plain might be in the [184]tundra,
   which is also an ecosystem (although once they are of this size, they
   are generally termed [185]ecozones or [186]biomes). In fact, the entire
   terrestrial surface of the earth, all the matter which composes it, the
   air that is directly above it, and all the living organisms living
   within it can be considered as one, large ecosystem.

   Ecosystems can be roughly divided into [187]terrestrial ecosystems
   (including [188]forest ecosystems, [189]steppes, [190]savannas, and so
   on), [191]freshwater ecosystems (lakes, ponds and rivers), and
   [192]marine ecosystems, depending on the dominant biotope.

[[193]edit] Dynamics and stability

          Main articles: [194]Biogeochemistry, [195]Homeostasis, and
          [196]Population dynamics

   Much attention has been given to preserving the natural characteristics
   of [197]Hopetoun Falls, Australia, while allowing ample access for
   visitors.

   Ecological factors that affect dynamic change in a population or
   species in a given ecology or [198]environment are usually divided into
   two groups: abiotic and biotic.

   Abiotic factors are geological, geographical, [199]hydrological, and
   climatological parameters. A biotope is an environmentally uniform
   region characterized by a particular set of abiotic ecological factors.
   Specific abiotic factors include:
     * Water, which is at the same time an essential element to life and a
       [200]milieu
     * Air, which provides oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide to living
       species and allows the dissemination of pollen and [201]spores
     * Soil, at the same time a source of nutriment and physical support
          + Soil [202]pH, [203]salinity, nitrogen and phosphorus content,
            ability to retain water, and density are all influential
     * Temperature, which should not exceed certain extremes, even if
       tolerance to heat is significant for some species
     * Light, which provides energy to the ecosystem through
       [204]photosynthesis
     * Natural disasters can also be considered abiotic

   Biocenose, or community, is a group of populations of plants, animals,
   microorganisms. Each population is the result of [205]procreations
   between individuals of the same species and [206]cohabitation in a
   given place and for a given time. When a population consists of an
   insufficient number of individuals, that population is threatened with
   extinction; the extinction of a species can approach when all
   biocenoses composed of individuals of the species are in decline. In
   small populations, [207]consanguinity (inbreeding) can result in
   reduced [208]genetic diversity, which can further weaken the biocenose.

   Biotic ecological factors also influence biocenose viability; these
   factors are considered as either intraspecific or interspecific
   relations.

          Intraspecific relations are those that are established between
          individuals of the same species, forming a population. They are
          relations of [209]cooperation or [210]competition, with division
          of the territory, and sometimes organization in hierarchical
          societies.

   An [211]antlion lies in wait under its pit trap, built in dry dust
   under a building, awaiting unwary insects that fall in. Many pest
   insects are partly or wholly [212]controlled by other insect predators.

          Interspecific relations[213]interactions between different
          speciesare numerous, and usually described according to their
          beneficial, detrimental, or neutral effect (for example,
          [214]mutualism (relation ++) or [215]competition (relation --).
          The most significant relation is the relation of [216]predation
          (to eat or to be eaten), which leads to the essential concepts
          in ecology of [217]food chains (for example, the grass is
          consumed by the herbivore, itself consumed by a carnivore,
          itself consumed by a carnivore of larger size). A high predator
          to prey ratio can have a negative influence on both the predator
          and prey biocenoses in that low availability of food and high
          death rate prior to sexual maturity can decrease (or prevent the
          increase of) populations of each, respectively. Selective
          hunting of species by humans that leads to population decline is
          one example of a high predator to prey ratio in action. Other
          interspecific relations include [218]parasitism, [219]infectious
          disease, and competition for limited resources, which can occur
          when two species share the same [220]ecological niche.

   The existing interactions between the various living beings go along
   with a permanent mixing of mineral and organic substances, absorbed by
   organisms for their growth, their maintenance, and their reproduction,
   to be finally rejected as waste. These permanent recycling of the
   elements (in particular carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen) as well as the
   water are called [221]biogeochemical cycles. They guarantee a durable
   stability of the biosphere (at least when unchecked human influence and
   extreme weather or geological phenomena are left aside). This
   self-regulation, supported by negative [222]feedback controls, ensures
   the perenniality of the ecosystems. It is shown by the very stable
   concentrations of most elements of each compartment. This is referred
   to as [223]homeostasis. The ecosystem also tends to evolve to a state
   of ideal balance, called the [224]climax, which is reached after a
   [225]succession of events (for example a pond can become a [226]peat
   bog).

[[227]edit] Spatial relationships and subdivisions of land

          Main articles: [228]Biome and [229]ecozone

   Ecosystems are not isolated from each other, but are interrelated. For
   example, water may circulate between ecosystems by means of a river or
   ocean current. Water itself, as a liquid medium, even defines
   ecosystems. Some species, such as salmon or freshwater eels, move
   between marine systems and fresh-water systems. These relationships
   between the ecosystems lead to the concept of a biome.

   A [230]biome is a homogeneous ecological formation that exists over a
   large region, such as [231]tundra or [232]steppes. The [233]biosphere
   comprises all of the Earth's biomes -- the entirety of places where
   life is possible -- from the highest mountains to the depths of the
   oceans.

   Biomes correspond rather well to subdivisions distributed along the
   latitudes, from the equator towards the [234]poles, with differences
   based on the physical environment (for example, oceans or mountain
   ranges) and the climate. Their variation is generally related to the
   distribution of species according to their ability to tolerate
   temperature, dryness, or both. For example, one may find
   [235]photosynthetic [236]algae only in the photic part of the ocean
   (where light penetrates), whereas [237]conifers are mostly found in
   mountains.

   Though this is a simplification of a more complicated scheme,
   [238]latitude and [239]altitude approximate a good representation of
   the distribution of [240]biodiversity within the biosphere. Very
   generally, the richness of biodiversity (as well for animal as for
   plant species) is decreasing most rapidly near the [241]equator and
   less rapidly as one approach the poles.

   The biosphere may also be divided into [242]ecozones, which are very
   well defined today and primarily follow the continental borders. The
   ecozones are themselves divided into [243]ecoregions, though there is
   not agreement on their limits.

[[244]edit] Ecosystem productivity

   In an ecosystem, the connections between species are generally related
   to their role in the [245]food chain. There are three categories of
   organisms:
   The [246]leaf is the primary site of [247]photosynthesis in plants.
     * [248]Producers or Autotrophs -- Usually plants or
       [249]cyanobacteria that are capable of [250]photosynthesis but
       could be other organisms such as the bacteria near ocean vents that
       are capable of [251]chemosynthesis.
     * [252]Consumers or Heterotrophs -- Animals, which can be primary
       consumers ([253]herbivorous), or secondary or tertiary consumers
       ([254]carnivorous and [255]omnivores).
     * [256]Decomposers or Detritivores -- [257]Bacteria, [258]fungi, and
       [259]insects which degrade organic matter of all types and restore
       [260]nutrients to the environment. The producers will then consume
       the nutrients, completing the [261]cycle.

   These relations form sequences, in which each individual consumes the
   preceding one and is consumed by the one following, in what are called
   [262]food chains or [263]food networks. In a food network, there will
   be fewer organisms at each level as one follows the links of the
   network up the chain, forming a [264]pyramid.

   These concepts lead to the idea of [265]biomass (the total living
   matter in an ecosystem), [266]primary productivity (the increase in
   organic compounds), and [267]secondary productivity (the living matter
   produced by consumers and the decomposers in a given time).
   An ecological pyramid.

   These last two ideas are key, since they make it possible to evaluate
   the [268]carrying capacity -- the number of organisms that can be
   supported by a given ecosystem. In any food network, the energy
   contained in the level of the producers is not completely transferred
   to the consumers. The higher up the chain, the more energy and
   resources are lost. Thus, from a purely energy and nutrient point of
   view, it is more efficient for humans to be primary consumers (to
   subsist from vegetables, grains, legumes, fruit, etc.) than to be
   secondary consumers (consuming herbivores, omnivores, or their
   products) and still more so than as a tertiary consumer (consuming
   carnivores, omnivores, or their products). An ecosystem is unstable
   when the carrying capacity is overrun.

   The total productivity of ecosystems is sometimes estimated by
   comparing three types of land-based ecosystems and the total of aquatic
   ecosystems. Slightly over half of [269]primary production is estimated
   to occur on land, and the rest in the ocean.
     * The forests (1/3 of the Earth's land area) contain dense biomasses
       and are very productive.
     * Savannas, meadows, and marshes (1/3 of the Earth's land area)
       contain less dense biomasses, but are productive. These ecosystems
       represent the major part of what humans depend on for food.
     * Extreme ecosystems in the areas with more extreme climates --
       deserts and semi-deserts, tundra, alpine meadows, and steppes --
       (1/3 of the Earth's land area) have very sparse biomasses and low
       productivity
     * Finally, the marine and fresh water ecosystems (3/4 of Earth's
       surface) contain very sparse biomasses (apart from the coastal
       zones).

   Ecosystems differ in biomass (grams carbon per square meter) and
   productivity (grams carbon per square meter per day), and direct
   comparisons of biomass and productivity may not be valid. An ecosystem
   such as that found in [270]taiga may be high in biomass, but slow
   growing and thus low in productivity. Ecosystems are often compared on
   the basis of their turnover (production ratio) or turnover time which
   is the reciprocal of turnover.

   Humanity's actions over the last few centuries have seriously reduced
   the amount of the Earth covered by forests ([271]deforestation), and
   have increased [272]agro-ecosystems. In recent decades, an increase in
   the areas occupied by extreme ecosystems has occurred, such as

[[274]edit] Ecological crisis

          Main article: [275]Ecological crisis

   The [276]retreat of [277]Aletsch Glacier in the [278]Swiss Alps
   (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to global warming.

   Generally, an [279]ecological crisis occurs with the loss of
   [280]adaptive capacity when the [281]resilience of an [282]environment
   or of a species or a population evolves in a way unfavourable to coping
   with [283]perturbations that interfere with that ecosystem, landscape
   or species survival (Note: The concept of resilience is not universally
   accepted in ecology, and moreso represents a contingent within the
   field that take a holist view of the environment. There are also many
   ecologists that take a reductionistic perspective and that believe that
   the environment, at base, is indeterministic). It may be that the
   environment quality degrades compared to the species needs, after a
   change in an abiotic [284]ecological factor (for example, an increase
   of temperature, less significant rainfalls)^[[285]citation needed]. It
   may be that the environment becomes unfavourable for the survival of a
   species (or a population) due to an increased pressure of
   [286]predation (for example overfishing). Lastly, it may be that the
   situation becomes unfavourable to the quality of life of the species
   (or the population) due to a rise in the number of individuals
   ([287]overpopulation).

   Ecological crises vary in length and severity, occurring within a few
   months or taking as long as a few million years. They can also be of
   natural or anthropic origin. They may relate to one unique species or
   to many species, as in an [288]Extinction event. Lastly, an ecological
   crisis may be local (as an [289]oil spill) or global (a rise in the sea
   level due to global warming).

   According to its degree of endemism, a local crisis will have more or
   less significant consequences, from the death of many individuals to
   the total extinction of a species. Whatever its origin, disappearance
   of one or several species often will involve a rupture in the food
   chain, further impacting the survival of other species.

   In the case of a global crisis, the consequences can be much more
   significant; some extinction events showed the disappearance of more
   than 90% of existing species at that time. However, it should be noted
   that the disappearance of certain species, such as the dinosaurs, by
   freeing an ecological niche, allowed the development and the
   diversification of the mammals. An ecological crisis thus paradoxically
   favoured biodiversity.

   Sometimes, an ecological crisis can be a specific and reversible
   phenomenon at the ecosystem scale. But more generally, the crises
   impact will last. Indeed, it rather is a connected series of events,
   that occur till a final point. From this stage, no return to the
   previous stable state is possible, and a new stable state will be set
   up gradually (see [290]homeorhesy).

   Lastly, if an ecological crisis can cause extinction, it can also more
   simply reduce the quality of life of the remaining individuals. Thus,
   even if the diversity of the human population is sometimes considered
   threatened (see in particular [291]indigenous people), few people
   envision human disappearance at short span. However, [292]epidemic
   diseases, [293]famines, impact on health of reduction of air quality,
   [294]food crises, reduction of living space, accumulation of toxic or
   non degradable wastes, threats on [295]keystone species (great apes,
   panda, whales) are also factors influencing the well-being of people.

   Due to the increases in technology and a rapidly increasing population,
   humans have more influence on their own environment than any other
   [296]ecosystem engineer.
