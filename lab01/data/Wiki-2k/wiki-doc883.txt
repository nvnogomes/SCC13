   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edith Anna none Somerville (2 May 1858 8 October 1949) was an [8]Irish
   [9]novelist who habitually signed herself as "E. . Somerville". She
   wrote in collaboration with her cousin "Martin Ross" ([10]Violet
   Martin) under the pseudonym, "Somerville and Ross". Together they
   published a series of fourteen stories and novels, the most popular of
   which were The Real Charlotte, and The Experiences of an Irish R. M.,
   published in 1899.

[[17]edit] Life

   She was born on [18]Corfu, where her father was stationed, the eldest
   of eight children.^[19][1] A year later he retired to Drishane,
   [20]County Cork, where Somerville grew up. She received her primary
   education at home, and then at [21]Alexandra College, [22]Dublin, later
   studying art in [23]Paris in 1884 and at the Royal Westminster School
   of Art in [24]London. At home riding and painting were her absorbing
   interests.^[25][1]

   In 1887 she met her cousin Violet Martin, and thus began their literary
   partnership. Their first book, An Irish Cousin, appeared in 1889. By
   the time Violet died in 1915 they had published fourteen books
   together.^[26][1]

   Somerville was stunned by Martin's death. She was in London the
   following year, still recovering from the shock, when the [27]1916
   Insurrection broke out. On 9 May she wrote a letter to the [28]Times,
   blaming the British Government for the state of affairs in
   Ireland.^[29][2] She tended towards Nationalism afterwards, and, an
   adept musician, at parties specialized in Irish tunes and Nationalist
   songs.^[30][3]

   Following Martin's death in 1915, Somerville continued to write as
   "Somerville and Ross", claiming that they were still in contact through
   a spiritualist [31]sances.

   She had exhibitions of her pictures in Dublin and in London between
   1920-38; and was active as an illustrator of children's picture books
   and sporting picture books. Somerville was a devoted sportswoman who,
   in 1903 became master of the West Carbery Foxhounds. She was also
   active in the [32]suffragist movement, corresponding with [33]Dame
   Ethel Smyth.^[34][4]

   She died at age 91 in [35]Castletownshend, [36]County Cork.
