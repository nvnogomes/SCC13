Marquess of Normanby

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Earl of Mulgrave)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   Constantine John Phipps,
   2nd Baron Mulgrave

   Marquess of Normanby is a title that has been created twice, once in
   the [9]Peerage of England and once in the [10]Peerage of the United
   Kingdom. The first creation came in 1694 in favour of John Sheffield,
   3rd Earl of Mulgrave. In 1703 he was further honoured when he was made
   [11]Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. For more information on this
   creation of the marquessate, see the Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.

   The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on [12]25
   June [13]1838, in favour of Constantine Henry Phipps, 2nd Earl of
   Mulgrave. The Phipps family descends from [14]Sir Constantine Phipps,
   [15]Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1710 to 1714. His son William
   Phipps married Lady Catherine Annesley, daughter and heiress of James
   Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey and his wife Lady Catherine Darnley,
   illegitimate daughter of [16]King James II by his mistress
   [17]Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester. Lady Catherine Darnley
   later married the aforementioned [18]John Sheffield, 1st Duke of
   Buckingham and Normanby.

   William Phipps's son Constantine Phipps was in 1767 raised to the
   [19]Peerage of Ireland as Baron Mulgrave, of New Ross in the County of
   Wexford. His son, the second Baron, was a politician but is best
   remembered for his attempted voyage to the [20]North Pole in 1773. In
   1790 he was created Baron Mulgrave, of Mulgrave in the County of York,
   in the [21]Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Mulgrave had no sons and on
   his death in 1792 the barony of 1790 became extinct. However, he was
   succeeded in the Irish barony by his younger brother, the third Baron.
   He was a [22]General in the Army as well as a prominent politician, and
   notably served as [23]Foreign Secretary from 1805 to 1806 and as
   [24]First Lord of the Admiralty from 1807 to 1810. In 1794 the barony
   held by his elder brother was revived when he was made Baron Mulgrave,
   of Mulgrave in the County of York, in the Peerage of Great Britain. In
   1812 Lord Mulgrave was further honoured when he was made Viscount
   Normanby, of Normanby in the County of York, and Earl of Mulgrave. Both
   titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

   His eldest son, the second Earl, was also a noted politician and served
   as [25]Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and as [26]Home Secretary. In 1838 he
   was created Marquess of Normanby, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.
   He was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He was a [27]Liberal
   politician and also served as [28]Governor of New Zealand. His
   grandson, the fourth Marquess, served briefly as a [29]Lord-in-Waiting
   (government whip in the [30]House of Lords) in 1945 and was also
   [31]Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire and of [32]North
   Yorkshire. As of 2007 the titles are held by the latter's eldest son,
   the fifth Marquess, who succeeded in 1994.

   Other members of the family have also gained distinction. The Hon.
   [33]Sir Charles Beaumont Phipps, second son of the first Earl, was a
   prominent court official. [34]Sir Constantine Edmund Henry Phipps, son
   of the Hon. Edmund Phipps, third son of the first Earl, was [35]British
   Ambassador to Belgium from 1900 to 1906, while his son [36]Sir Eric
   Clare Edmund Phipps was [37]British Ambassador to Germany between 1933
   and 1937 and to [38]France between 1937 and 1939. Also, [39]Sir William
   Phipps (or Phips), [40]Governor of Massachusetts, was a member of
   another branch of the family.
