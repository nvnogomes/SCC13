   Alexandrina Council is a [34]local government area covering the north
   east portion of [35]Fleurieu Peninsula in [36]South Australia. The
   Alexandrina Council was formed in 1997 by the amalgamation of the
   former District Council of Strathalbyn, the District Council of Port
   Elliot and Goolwa, and a portion of the District Council of
   Willunga.^[37][2] For this reason, the district is split into five
   [38]wards, which represent smaller subdivisions of the district.

   The district relies on a diverse range of industries including
   [39]agriculture, [40]fishing, [41]forestry, [42]viticulture and
   [43]tourism to supply its [44]economy. Many of the towns encompassed in
   the council are popular tourist towns not far from [45]Adelaide.

[[52]edit] Economy

   The economy of the Alexandrina Council is very diverse, which may be
   attributed to the great diversity of landscapes within its boundaries,
   allowing for diverse [53]rural, [54]fishing and [55]tourism industries
   to occur. The largest part of the economy comes from agriculture, with
   a wide variety of farming practices including [56]dairy, [57]beef and
   [58]sheep farming, with areas around Goolwa and Mount Compass prominent
   in the dairy industry.^[59][3] A number of [60]crops including
   [61]cereals, as well as [62]Lucerne are planted in the district
   Langhorne Creek and Currency Creek are well known for its
   [63]viticulture, producing high quality [64]Sauvignon Blanc,
   [65]Cabernet Sauvignon, [66]Merlot, [67]Shiraz and
   [68]Chardonnay.^[69][4] In the Kuitpo region, [70]forestry is
   prominent, with large tracts of [71]pine present.^[72][5]

   The district borders three distinct bodies of water, the [73]Southern
   Ocean, [74]The Coorong and The Lower [75]Murray River, all of which are
   commercially exploited for a variety of [76]fish and [77]crustaceans.
   The coasts produce [78]shark, [79]mulloway and [80]Australian salmon,
   as well as huge numbers of [81]Goolwa cockles which are exported all
   over South Australia. The Coorong holds large numbers of Salmon,
   Mulloway, Shark, Bream and Mullet, all of which are caught
   commercially.^[82][6] Commercial fishing above the Locks has become
   highly regulated to conserve native fish species but [83]Golden Perch
   and [84]Murray Cod are still caught, and a number of operators have
   found markets for the invasive [85]European Carp.^[86][7]

   The area also has a significant tourism industry, particularly based
   around the [87]Murray River at [88]Goolwa and the beaches of [89]Port
   Elliot and [90]Middleton. The [91]Steamranger Cockle Train operates
   from Goolwa and stops at Port Elliot on the way to [92]Victor Harbor.
