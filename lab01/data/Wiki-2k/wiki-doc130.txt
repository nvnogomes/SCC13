Domain Name System Security Extensions

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are a suite of
   [8]IETF specifications for securing certain kinds of information
   provided by the [9]Domain Name System (DNS) as used on [10]Internet
   Protocol (IP) networks. It is a set of extensions to DNS which provide
   to DNS clients (resolvers):
     * Origin authentication of DNS data
     * Data integrity (but not availability or confidentiality)
     * Authenticated denial of existence

   It is widely believed that securing the DNS is critically important for
   securing the Internet as a whole, but deployment of DNSSEC specifically
   has been hampered by the difficulty of:
    1. Devising a backward-compatible standard that can scale to the size
       of the Internet
    2. Preventing "zone enumeration" (see below) where desired
    3. Deploying DNSSEC implementations across a wide variety of DNS
       servers and resolvers (clients)
    4. Disagreement among key players over who should own the .com (etc)
       root keys
    5. Overcoming the perceived complexity of DNSSEC and DNSSEC deployment

   Some of these problems are in the process of being resolved, and
   deployments in various domains have begun to take place^[[11]citation

[[30]edit] Overview

   IP-based networks, including the [31]Internet, route information
   between computers based on their IP address, a multi-byte number (four
   bytes in [32]IP version 4, sixteen bytes in [33]IP version 6). Directly
   using these numbers would cause many problems, so DNS is a critical
   service of such networks. DNS accepts a domain name (such as
   example.com) and responds with information about that name, such as its
   matching IP address. DNS can also perform reverse look-ups (given an IP
   address, return the corresponding name). DNS is implemented as a
   distributed system, for scalability. (For more information, see
   [34]Domain Name System.) Unfortunately, DNS was not designed to be
   secure.

   There are several distinct classes of threats to the DNS, most of which
   are DNS-related instances of more general problems, but a few of which
   are specific to peculiarities of the DNS protocol. A [35]Request for
   Comments document, [36]RFC 3833, attempts to document some of the known
   threats to the DNS, and, in doing so, attempts to measure to what
   extent DNSSEC is a useful tool in defending against these threats.

   DNSSEC was designed to protect Internet resolvers (clients) from forged
   DNS data, such as that created by [37]DNS cache poisoning. All answers
   in DNSSEC are [38]digitally signed. By checking the [39]digital
   signature, a DNS resolver is able to check if the information is
   identical (correct and complete) to the information on the
   authoritative DNS server. While protecting IP addresses is the
   immediate concern for many users, DNSSEC can protect other information
   such as general-purpose cryptographic certificates stored in DNS.
   [40]RFC 4398 describes how to distribute certificates via DNS,
   including those for email, making it possible to use DNSSEC as a
   world-wide public key infrastructure for email.

   DNSSEC does not provide confidentiality of data, in particular, all
   DNSSEC responses are authenticated but not encrypted. DNSSEC does not
   protect against [41]DoS attacks directly, though it indirectly provides
   some benefit (because signature checking allows the use of potentially
   untrustworthy parties). Other standards (not DNSSEC) are used to secure
   bulk data (such as a zone transfer) sent between DNS servers. As
   documented in IETF [42]RFC 4367, some users and developers make false
   assumptions about DNS names, such as assuming that a company's common
   name plus ".com" is always its domain name. DNSSEC cannot cure false
   assumptions; it can only authenticate that the data is truly from or
   not available from the domain owner.

   The DNSSEC specifications (called DNSSEC-bis) describe the current
   DNSSEC protocol in great detail. See [43]RFC 4033, [44]RFC 4034, and
   [45]RFC 4035. With the publication of these new RFCs (March 2005),
   [46]RFC 2535 has become obsolete.

[[47]edit] History

   DNS is a critical and fundamental Internet service, yet in [48]1990
   [49]Steve Bellovin discovered serious security flaws in it. Research
   into securing it began, and dramatically increased when his paper was
   made public in [50]1995.^[51][1] The initial [52]RFC 2065 was published
   by the IETF in [53]1997, and initial attempts to implement that
   specification led to a revised (and believed fully workable)
   specification in [54]1999 as IETF [55]RFC 2535. Plans were made to
   deploy DNSSEC based on [56]RFC 2535.

   Unfortunately, the IETF [57]RFC 2535 specification had very significant
   problems scaling up to the full Internet; by 2001 it became clear that
   this specification was unusable for large networks. In normal operation
   DNS servers often get out of sync with their parents. This isn't
   usually a problem, but when DNSSEC is enabled, this out-of-sync data
   could have the effect of a serious self-created denial of service. The
   original DNSSEC required a complex six-message protocol and a lot of
   data transfers to perform key changes for a child (DNS child zones had
   to send all of their data up to the parent, have the parent sign each
   record, and then send those signatures back to the child for the child
   to store in a SIG record). Also, public key changes could have absurd
   effects; for example, if the ".com" zone changed its public key, it
   would have to send 22 million records (because it would need to update
   all of the signatures in all of its children). Thus, DNSSEC as defined
   in [58]RFC 2535 could not scale up to the Internet.

   The IETF fundamentally modified DNSSEC, which is called DNSSEC-bis when
   necessary to distinguish it from the original DNSSEC approach of
   [59]RFC 2535. This new version uses "delegation signer (DS) resource
   records" to provide an additional level of indirection at delegation
   points between a parent and child zone. In the new approach, when a
   child's master public key changes, instead of having to have six
   messages for every record in the child, there is one simple message:
   the child sends the new public key to its parent (signed, of course).
   Parents simply store one master public key for each child; this is much
   more practical. This means that a little data is pushed to the parent,
   instead of massive amounts of data being exchanged between the parent
   and children. This does mean that clients have to do a little more work
   when verifying keys. More specifically, verifying a DNS zone's KEY
   RRset requires two signature verification operations instead of the one
   required by [60]RFC 2535 (there is no impact on the number of
   signatures verified for other types of RRsets). Most view this as a
   small price to pay, since it changes DNSSEC so it is more practical to
   deploy.

[[61]edit] Zone enumeration issue, controversy, and NSEC3

   Although the goal of DNSSEC is to increase security, DNSSEC as defined
   in RFCs 4033 through 4035 introduces a new problem that many believe is
   a new security vulnerability: the zone enumeration (aka zone walking)
   issue. DNSSEC forces the exposure of information that by normal DNS
   best practice is kept private. NSEC3 ([62]RFC 5155) was developed to
   address this issue; it was released in March 2008.

[[63]edit] Why DNS zone data is normally kept private

   When the DNS protocol was designed, it was not intended to be a
   repository for hidden information. However, since the DNS does house
   information about the internals of a network related to a given domain,
   many view the contents of their DNS database as private. In particular,
   DNS systems are typically configured so that most users are not allowed
   to retrieve the entire list of names or other information in a zone.
   Such a list would greatly aid attackers, since that list can give them
   important information about what machines exist. Some administrators
   even put system type and configuration information into their DNS
   databases which is even more valuable to an attacker. The widely used
   book DNS and BIND (4th edition) by Albitz and Liu explains it this way:

     Arguably even more important than controlling who can query your
     name server is ensuring that only your real slave name servers can
     transfer zones from your name server. Users on remote hosts... can
     only look up records (e.g., addresses) for domain names they already
     know, one at a time... It's the difference between letting random
     folks call your company's switchboard and ask for John Q. Cubicle's
     phone number [versus] sending them a copy of your corporate phone
     directory.^[64][2]

   In addition, the information from an enumerated zone can be used as a
   key for multiple [65]WHOIS queries; this would reveal registrant data
   which many registries are under strict legal obligations to protect
   under various contracts.

   It is unclear whether DNSSEC is legal to deploy at all in many
   countries, unless such lists can be kept private. [66]DENIC has stated
   that DNSSEC's zone enumeration issue violates Germany's Federal Data
   Protection Act, and other European countries have similar privacy laws
   forbidding the public release of certain kinds of information.

[[67]edit] DNSSEC reveals zone data

   Unfortunately, DNSSEC's original design required that the entire list
   of zone names be revealed to all. As stated in [68]RFC 4033,

     DNSSEC introduces the ability for a hostile party to enumerate all
     the names in a zone by following the NSEC chain. NSEC RRs assert
     which names do not exist in a zone by linking from existing name to
     existing name along a canonical ordering of all the names within a
     zone. Thus, an attacker can query these NSEC RRs in sequence to
     obtain all the names in a zone. Although this is not an attack on
     the DNS itself, it could allow an attacker to map network hosts or
     other resources by enumerating the contents of a zone.

   There is an "obvious" solution, called a [69]split-horizon DNS, which
   is how DNS without DNSSEC is sometimes deployed but this approach does
   not work well with DNSSEC. In the "split-horizon DNS" approach, the DNS
   server denies the existence of names to some clients, and provides
   correct information to other clients. However, since DNSSEC information
   is cryptographically signed as authoritative, an attacker could request
   the signed "does not exist" record, then retransmit the record to cause
   a denial of service. DNSSEC fundamentally changes DNS so it can provide
   authoritative information; thus, it does not work well with methods
   based on providing false information to some users.

   The reason DNSSEC introduced this problem is because it must be able to
   report when a name is not found. Most believe DNS servers supporting
   DNSSEC must be able to sign that not-found report otherwise a not-found
   report could be easily spoofed. Yet for security reasons the signing
   key should not be online. As a result, DNSSEC was designed to report a
   signed message that reports that a given range of names does not exist,
   which can be signed ahead-of-time offline. Unfortunately, this
   information is enough for an attacker to gain much more information
   than would have been available to them otherwise it is enough to enable
   an attacker to quickly gather all the names in a zone, and then through
   targeted queries on the names to reconstruct all or most of a zone's
   data.

   As noted earlier, DNSSEC could be used as the basis for a worldwide
   [70]public key infrastructure for email addresses, by using DNS to
   serve email certificates and DNSSEC to validate them. However, this
   DNSSEC issue makes this unlikely for most organizations, at least if
   used directly. As [71]RFC 4398 states, "If an organization chooses to
   issue certificates for its employees, placing CERT RRs in the DNS by
   owner name, and if DNSSEC (with NSEC) is in use, it is possible for
   someone to enumerate all employees of the organization. This is usually
   not considered desirable, for the same reason that enterprise phone
   listings are not often publicly published and are even marked
   confidential."

[[72]edit] Response and NSEC3

   Many of the participants on the IETF DNS Extensions working group
   originally stated that zone enumeration was not a significant problem,
   arguing that the DNS data wasor should bepublic. However, registrars
   and many large organizations told the working group members that DNSSEC
   as currently defined was unacceptable, and that they would not or
   legally could not deploy it.

   After deliberation, an extension was developed: "DNSSEC Hashed
   Authenticated Denial of Existence" (informally called "NSEC3"). In this
   approach, DNSSEC-aware servers can choose to send an "NSEC3" record
   instead of an NSEC record when a record is not found. The NSEC3 record
   is signed, but instead of including the name directly (which would
   enable zone enumeration), the NSEC3 record includes a cryptographically
   hashed value of the name. The NSEC3 record includes both a hash after a
   number of iterations and an optional salt. Salt, where used, increases
   the number of pre-computed dictionaries that an attacker using a
   pre-computed dictionary attack would need to create, increasing
   iteration values raise the computational cost of computing a
   dictionary. In March 2008, NSEC3 was formally defined in [73]RFC 5155.

   [74]VeriSign was running an NSEC3 DNSSEC Pilot to provide others with
   operational experience with NSEC3 at the top-level-domain level and an
   independent implementation of the authoritative server component. This
   pilot provided a DNSSEC signed version of .com and .net using the NSEC3
   record. The pilot is now defunct.

[[75]edit] Deployment

   The Internet is considered a critical infrastructure by many, yet it
   was originally based on the fundamentally insecure DNS. Thus, there is
   strong incentive to secure DNS, and deploying DNSSEC is generally
   considered to be a critical part of that effort. For example, the U.S.
   National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace specifically identified the need
   to secure DNS.^[76][3] Widescale deployment of DNSSEC could resolve
   many other security problems as well, such as secure key distribution
   for e-mail addresses.

   However, the DNSSEC specification has been challenging to develop.
   NSEC3, one of its critical pieces, was only formally defined in an RFC
   in March 2008, and it is not yet widely deployed.

   In addition, DNSSEC deployment in large-scale networks is also
   challenging. DNSSEC can be deployed at any level of a DNS hierarchy,
   but it must be widely available in a zone before many others will adopt
   it. DNS servers must be updated with software that supports DNSSEC, and
   DNSSEC data must be created and added to the DNS zone data. A
   TCP/IP-using client must have their DNS resolver (client) updated
   before it can use DNSSEC's capabilities. What is more, any resolver
   must have, or have a way to acquire, at least one public key that it
   can trust before it can start using DNSSEC. Ozment and Schechter
   observe that DNSSEC (and other technologies) has a "bootstrap problem":
   users typically only deploy a technology if they receive an immediate
   benefit, but if a minimal level of deployment is required before any
   users receive a benefit greater than their costs, it risks remaining
   undeployed.

   To address these challenges, significant effort is ongoing to deploy
   DNSSEC, because the Internet is so vital to so many organizations.

[[77]edit] Tools

   DNSSEC deployment requires software on the server and client side. Some
   of the tools that support DNSSEC include:
     * [78]BIND, the most popular DNS name server. Version 9.3 implemented
       the newer DNSSEC-bis (DS records) although it did not support NSEC3
       records. BIND 9.6 implements full support for NSEC3
       records^[79][4]; an alpha version of BIND 9.6 became available in
       October 2008^[80][5].
     * [81]Drill is a DNSSEC-enabled [82]dig-like tool bundled with
       [83]ldns.
     * [84]Drill extension for Firefox adds to [85]Mozilla Firefox the
       ability to determine if a domain can be verified using DNSSEC.
     * [86]DNSSEC-Tools is a [87]SourceForge project aimed at providing
       easy to use tools for helping all types of administrators and users
       make use of DNSSEC. It offers tools for administrators of
       [88]Authoritative Zones, [89]Authoritative Server, and
       [90]Recursive Servers as well as a library and tools for
       [91]Application Developers and existing patches for extending
       [92]common applications.
     * [93]Zone Key Tool is a software designed to ease the maintenance of
       DNSSEC aware zones. It's primarily designed for environments with a
       small to medium number of zones and provides a full automatic zone
       signing key rollover as well as automatic resigning of the zone.
     * [94]Unbound is a DNS name server that was written from the ground
       up to be designed around DNSSEC concepts.
     * DNSSEC support is being introduced in [95]Windows 7 and [96]Windows
       Server 2008 R2, and may be introduced in Windows Server 2008
       Service Pack 2 as well.^[97][6]
     * [98]mysqlBind The GPL OSS for DNS ASPs now supports DNSSEC.

[[99]edit] Early deployments

   Early adopters include [100]Brazil ([101].br), [102]Bulgaria
   ([103].bg), [104]Czech Republic ([105].cz), [106]Puerto Rico ([107].pr)
   and [108]Sweden ([109].se) who use DNSSEC for their [110]country code
   top-level domains,^[111][7], the [112]Public Interest Registry which
   registers domains in the .org top-level domain,^[113][7] [114]RIPE
   NCC,who have signed all the reverse (in-addr.arpa) that are delegated
   to it from IANA ^[115][8], and [116]VeriSign. TDC was the first ISP to
   implement this feature in Sweden.

   IANA has been publicly testing a sample signed root at
   [117]https://ns.iana.org/dnssec/status.html since June 2007.

   VeriSign was running a pilot project to allow .com and .net domains to
   register themselves to do DNSSEC NSEC3 experiments, as noted above.

   A wide variety of pilot projects and experiments are and have been
   performed. [118]dnssec.net maintains a list of such projects. There is
   also a Google Map of [119]World Wide DNSSEC Deployment.

[[120]edit] Deployment at the DNS root

   Many are interested in deploying DNSSEC at the root level. If deployed
   widely at the root level, DNSSEC could support distribution of public
   keys associated with any arbitrary domain name, countering many spam
   and spoof attacks. Having a few DNS root-level DNSSEC public keys would
   greatly simplify the deployment of DNSSEC resolvers, since those few
   keys could be the basis for any other key. However, root level
   deployment may be delayed for a variety of reasons.

   Thierry Moreau reports that as of [121]May 22, [122]2006, the
   technology is nearly ready.^[[123]citation needed] Thierry reports that
   the major technological problems stalling deployment are:
    1. The zone enumeration privacy issue (noted above).
    2. The trust anchor key rollover issue.
    3. Further testing is desired to strengthen the confidence that DNSSEC
       is adequate (especially given the failures of earlier versions).

   However, political issues are likely to cause trouble and delay
   deployment:
     * Other countries are concerned about U.S. control over the Internet,
       and may reject any centralized keying for this reason.
     * It is unclear how [124]ICANN would handle delegation of names to
       those top-level domains with whom they have no formal agreement.
       For example, Canada's .ca [125]TLD administration, CIRA
       ([126]Canadian Internet Registration Authority), has withdrawn
       ICANN support.^[127][9]
     * Will some governments try to ban DNSSEC-backed encryption key
       distribution?

   ICANN has described its DNS root zone signing as simply to "determine
   timetable, coordination requirements and costs for full
   deployment"^[128][10] instead of actual deployment, suggesting that it
   may be a long time before DNSSEC is deployed at the root (global) level
   of DNS.

   The [129]Public Interest Registry announced in July, 2008 that it will
   begin using DNSSEC in a then-unspecified deployment timetable. It
   further detailed on September 26, 2008, that the first phase, involving
   large registrars it has a strong working relationship with ("friends
   and family") will be the first to be able to sign their domains,
   beginning "early 2009".^[130][11] In September, ICANN and VeriSign each
   published implementation proposals^[131][12] and in October, the
   [132]National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a part
   of the U.S. Department of Commerce, asked the public for
   comments.^[133][13]

[[134]edit] DNSSEC Deployment Initiative

   The Science and Technology Directorate of the [135]U.S. Department of
   Homeland Security (DHS) sponsors the "DNSSEC Deployment Initiative".
   This initiative encourages "all sectors to voluntarily adopt security
   measures that will improve security of the Internet's naming
   infrastructure, as part of a global, cooperative effort that involves
   many nations and organizations in the public and private sectors." DHS
   also funds efforts to mature DNSSEC and get it deployed inside the U.S.
   federal government.

   It was reported^[136][14] that on [137]March 30, [138]2007, the
   [139]U.S. Department of Homeland Security proposed "to have the key to
   sign the DNS root zone solidly in the hands of the US government."
   However no U.S. Government officials were present in the meeting room
   and the comment that sparked the article was made by another party. DHS
   later commented^[140][15] on why they believe others jumped to the
   false conclusion that the U.S. Government had made such a proposal: "
   The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is funding the development of
   a technical plan for implementing DNSSec, and last October distributed
   an initial draft of it to a long list of international experts for
   comments. The draft lays out a series of options for who could be the
   holder, or "operator," of the Root Zone Key, essentially boiling down
   to a governmental agency or a contractor. "Nowhere in the document do
   we make any proposal about the identity of the Root Key Operator," said
   Maughan, the cyber-security research and development manager for
   Homeland Security."

[[141]edit] DNSSEC deployment in the U.S. federal government

   The [142]National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   published NIST Special Publication 800-81 Secure Domain Name System
   (DNS) Deployment Guide on [143]May 16, [144]2006, with guidance on how
   to deploy DNSSEC. NIST intended to release new DNSSEC Federal
   Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements in NIST
   SP800-53-R1, referencing this deployment guide. U.S. agencies would
   then have had one year after final publication of NIST SP800-53-R1 to
   meet these new FISMA requirements.^[145][16] However, at the time NSEC3
   had not been completed. NIST had suggested using split domains, a
   technique that is known to be possible but is difficult to deploy
   correctly, and has the security weaknesses noted above.

   On 2008-08-22, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a
   memorandum requiring U.S. Federal Agencies to deploy DNSSEC across .gov
   sites; the .gov root must be signed by January 2009, and all subdomains
   under .gov must be signed by December 2009 [146][1]. While the memo
   focuses on .gov sites, the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency says
   it intends to meet OMB DNSSEC requirements in the .mil (U.S. military)
   domain as well. NetworkWorld's Carolyn Duffy Marsan stated that DNSSEC
   "hasn't been widely deployed because it suffers from a classic
   chicken-and-egg dilemma... with the OMB mandate, it appears the egg is
   cracking." [147][2]
