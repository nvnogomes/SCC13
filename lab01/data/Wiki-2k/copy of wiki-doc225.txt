   Doraemon ( Doraemon ^[151]?) is a [152]Japanese [153]manga series
   created by [154]Fujiko F. Fujio (the pen name of [155]Hiroshi Fujimoto)
   which later became an [156]anime series and [157]Asian [158]franchise.
   The series is about a [159]robotic cat named Doraemon, who [160]travels
   back in time from the 22nd century to aid a schoolboy, Nobita Nobi (
   ,Nobi Nobita^[161]?).

   In March 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon as the
   nation's first "anime ambassador."^[162][2] Ministry spokesman
   explained the novel decision as an attempt to help people in other
   countries to understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their
   interest in [163]Japanese culture."^[164][3] The Foreign Ministry
   action confirms that Doraemon has come to be considered a Japanese
   cultural icon. In 2002, the anime character was acclaimed as an Asian
   Hero in a special feature survey conducted by [165]Time Asia
   magazine^[166][4].

   The series first appeared in December 1969, when it was published
   simultaneously in six different magazines. In total, 1,344 stories were
   created in the original series, which are published by [167]Shogakukan
   under the Tentmushi ( ^[168]?) manga brand, extending to forty-five
   volumes. The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in
   Toyama, Japan. Fujio was born in Toyama.

   A majority of Doraemon episodes are comedies with moral lessons
   regarding values such as integrity, perseverance, courage, family and
   respect for elders. Several noteworthy environmental issues are often
   visited, including homeless animals, [169]endangered species,
   [170]deforestation, and [171]pollution. Topics such as [172]dinosaurs,
   the [173]flat earth theory, [174]wormhole traveling, [175]Gulliver's
   Travels, and the [176]history of Japan are often covered.

   Doraemon was awarded the first [177]Shogakukan Manga Award for
   [178]children's manga in 1982,^[179][5] and the first [180]Osamu Tezuka
   Culture Award in 1997.

[[200]edit] History

   In December 1969, the Doraemon manga appeared simultaneously in six
   different children's monthly magazines. The magazines were titled by
   the year of children's studies, which included Yoiko (good children),
   Ychien (nursery school), and Shogaku Ichinensei (first grade of primary
   school) to Shogaku Yonnensei (fourth grade of primary school). By 1973,
   the series began to appear in two more magazines, Shogaku Gonensei
   (fifth grade of primary school) and Shogaku Rokunensei (sixth grade of
   primary school). The stories featured in each of the magazines were
   different, meaning the author was originally creating more than six
   stories each month. In 1977, [201]CoroCoro Comic was launched as a
   magazine of Doraemon. Original manga based on the Doraemon movies were
   also released in CoroCoro Comic. The stories which are preserved under
   the Tentmushi brand are the stories found in these magazines.

   Since the debut of Doraemon in 1969, the stories have been selectively
   collected into forty-five books published from 1974 to 1996, which had
   a circulation of over 80 million in 1992. In addition, Doraemon has
   appeared in a variety of manga series by Shgakukan. In 2005, Shgakukan
   published a series of five more manga volumes under the title Doraemon+
   (Doraemon Plus), which were not found in the forty-five Tentmushi pipi
   volumes. Many other series have since been produced, some not from
   official supplies.

[[202]edit] Plot summary

   The first appearance of Doraemon, who came via the time machine.

   Doraemon is sent back in time by Nobita Nobi's great-great grandson
   Sewashi to improve Nobita's circumstances so that his descendants may
   enjoy a better future. In the original timeline, Nobita experienced
   nothing but misery and misfortune throughout his life. As a result of
   this, Nobita's failures in school and subsequently, his career, have
   left his family line beset with financial problems. In order to alter
   history and better the Nobi family's fortunes, Sewashi sent him a robot
   called Doraemon.

   Doraemon has a large pocket from which he produces many gadgets from
   the future. The pocket is called yojigen-pocket, or 4 dimension pocket.

   Although he can hear perfectly well, Doraemon has no ears: his robotic
   ears were eaten by a mouse, giving him a series-long [203]phobia of the
   creatures.

   The stories are formulaic, usually focused on the everyday struggles of
   fourth grader Nobita, the protagonist of the story. In a typical
   chapter, Nobita comes home crying about a problem he faces in school
   and/or the local neighborhood. After hearing him out, Doraemon always
   offers helpful advice to his problem(s), but that's never enough for
   Nobita, who is consistently looking for the "quick, easy" way out
   (which offers insight to the viewers as to why Nobita's life turned out
   the way it did). Finally, after Nobita's pleading and/or goading,
   Doraemon produces a futuristic gadget out of his aforementioned pouch
   to help Nobita fix his problem, enact revenge, or flaunt to his
   friends.

   Nobita usually goes too far, despite Doraemon's best intentions and
   warnings, and gets into deeper trouble than before. Sometimes, Nobita's
   friends (usually Suneo or Jaian) steal the gadgets and end up misusing
   them. However, by the end of the story, there is usually retribution to
   the characters who end up misusing them, and a moral is taught.

[[204]edit] Series finale rumors

   There are three current and often quoted [205]urban legends that
   started spreading in late 1980s of an ending to the Doraemon series.
     * The first and the most optimistic ending was made public by Nobuo
       Sato several years ago. Doraemon's battery power ran out, and
       Nobita was given a choice between replacing the battery inside a
       frozen Doraemon, which would cause it to reset and lose all memory,
       or await a competent robotics technician who would be able to
       resurrect the cat-robot one day. Nobita swore that very day to work
       hard in school, graduate with honours, and become that robotics
       technician. He successfully resurrected Doraemon in the future as a
       robotics professor, became successful as an [206]AI developer, and
       thus lived happily ever after, thus relieving his progeny of the
       financial burdens that caused Doraemon to be sent to his space-time
       in the first place. A [207]djin manga for this ending was made by a
       "Tajima T Yasue" in 2005, and it sold 13,000 copies before
       Shogakukan halted its publication. Tajima apologized to Shogakukan
       in 2007 and paid an undisclosed amount of money for
       [208]settlement.^[209][6].

     * The second, more pessimistic ending suggests that Nobita Nobi is
       suffering from [210]autism and that all the characters (including
       Doraemon) are simply his [211]delusion. The idea that Nobita was a
       sick and dying little boy who imagined the entire series on his
       sickbed to help him ease his pain and depression no doubt angered
       quite a lot of fans. Many Japanese fans staged a protest outside
       the headquarters of the publisher of the series after learning
       about this suggestion. The publisher had to issue a public
       statement that this is not true. (This ending actually correlates
       to the ending for the series [212]St. Elsewhere, which ended in
       1988.)

     * The third ending suggests that Nobita fell and hit his head on a
       rock. He fell into a deep coma, and eventually into a
       semi-vegetative state. To raise money for an operation to save
       Nobita, Doraemon sold all the tools and devices in his
       four-dimensional pocket. However, the operation failed. Doraemon
       sold all his tools except for one used as a last resort. He used it
       to enable Nobita to go wherever he wanted, whichever time or era he
       wished to go. In the end, the very place Nobita wanted to go was
       [213]heaven.

   The plausibility of these issues was discussed [214]here and it was
   concluded that there is no ending to Doraemon. ^[215][7]

   There are three official endings to Doraemon that were made. Doraemon
   was discontinued in two media because readers were advancing in grades
   and an ending was believed to be needed. These two are not reprinted.
     * In the March 1971 issue of the magazine Shogaku 4-nensei ^[216][8]:
       Due to the fact that visitors from the future were causing too much
       trouble, the government in the 22nd Century passed a bill to ban
       time-travelling altogether, meaning Doraemon would have to return
       to his time era. He leaves Nobita.

     * In the March 1972 issue of the magazine Shogaku 4-nensei: Doraemon,
       for some reason, had to go back to the future but fakes a
       mechanical problem so that Nobita would let him go. Nobita believes
       him and promises to wait until Doraemon gets well. Realizing that
       Nobita can handle his departure, Doraemon tells the truth and
       Nobita accepts. Doraemon returns to the future.

   The third ending was actually meant to be the official ending due to
   low TV ratings and the [217]Fujiko Fujio duo was busy with other works.
   But Doraemon did not leave their minds and restarted from next month's
   issue. In 1981, this episode was made into anime (called "Doraemon
   Comes Back"), and in 1998, this was released as an anime movie.
     * In the March 1973 issue of the magazine Shogaku 4-nensei, Nobita
       again returns home after losing a fight against Gian. Doraemon then
       explains that he has to return. Nobita tries to have Doraemon stay
       but after talking it over with his parents, he accepts Doraemon's
       departure. They take a last walk in the park. After they split up,
       Nobita encounters Jaian and gets into a fight again. After a long
       duel with Nobita trying to win at all costs so that Doraemon can
       leave without worries, Gian gave up (which gave Nobita the win)
       because no matter what, Nobita refuses to stay down. Doraemon finds
       Nobita passed out with a bloody mouth and takes him home. Sitting
       beside sleeping Nobita and after a moment of thought, Doraemon
       returns to the future. (It is also found at the last chapter of the
       manga Book 6).

     * The animated version is completely similar but lengthened. Nobita
       finds a box the shape of Doraemon in his drawer. The next day,
       which happens to be April Fool's Day, Nobita is jeered at by Suneo
       and Jaian, the latter tricking him about Doraemon's return. He
       happily runs home and asked his mother whether Doraemon came back
       and finds out the truth. Nobita couldn't stand it and opens the
       box. Inside of it was a bottle of liquid. He hears Doraemon's voice
       explaining that the potion is called Uso 800 (Lies 800) it is used
       to make all untruths the drinker says true. Nobita uses it to play
       a few tricks on Jaian and Suneo, like first taking cover then say
       that the weather sure is good, which becomes a lie and it started
       to rain heavily before he said it is raining heavily and the rain
       stopped. Jian and Suneo was scared away after a few tricks and when
       Nobita mentioned what is happening. Nobita was very happy at first
       but quickly loses interest in the absence of Doraemon. As he walks
       home, due to his earlier questioning if Doraemon returned or not,
       his mother asked him if he could find Doraemon, he unwittingly
       said, in great disappointment, the truth about Doraemon never
       coming back, just like what Doraemon told Nobita before his
       departure. Since the potion was still in effect, when he arrives
       his room he finds Doraemon there, and they have a happy reunion,
       but due to the effects of the potion, all his greets and joyful
       words have to be spoken in the opposite way like I am so unhappy
       that we can never be together again.. The extended ending from the
       animated series was eventually adapted to the first story of Book 7
       in the manga series, with a few changes (i.e. Instead of hearing
       Doraemon's voice explaining the use of the potion, he finds a card
       inside the box describing the use of the potion).

   When the [218]Fujiko Fujio duo broke up in 1987, the very idea of an
   official ending to the series was never discussed. Since Fujiko F. died
   in 1996 before any decisions were reached, any "endings" of Doraemon
   are [219]fan fiction. However, it is apparent from many episodes and
   movies where Nobita travels to the future that in the end he does marry
   Shizuka, leads a happy life and separates with Doraemon, although
   Nobita and his friends fondly remember him. ^[220][9] life

[[221]edit] Characters

          Main article: [222]List of Doraemon characters

   The only main female character is Shizuka Minamoto ( ,Minamoto
   Shizuka^[223]?), who serves as a semi-romantic [224]girlfriend of
   Nobita, but otherwise a supporting, minor character. Nobita's main
   human friends include Gian, a known bully, and Suneo, a gloating
   spoiled wealthy kid. There are many recurring supporting characters,
   such as Dekisugi, Nobita's parents, his school teacher, his descendants
   from the future, and Doraemon's sister, Dorami.

[[227]edit] Dgu

          Main article: [228]List of Doraemon's Dgu

   Doraemon can take out various devices known as dgu ( ,lit. tool^[229]?)
   from his fourth-dimensional pocket. Some of the gadgets are based on
   real Japanese household devices with fanciful twists, but most are
   completely [230]science fiction (although some may be based on folklore
   or religious stories).

   Thousands of dgu have been featured in Doraemon. Some^[[231]who?] have
   placed the number of dgu at approximately 4,500.

[[232]edit] Other appearances

   Doraemon is a cultural phenomenon in Japan and can be seen in many
   places. For example, Doraemon is used as a promotional character by Art
   Hikkoshi Center ( ,to hikkoshi sent^[233]?), by a removals company, and
   by Cocos, a restaurant chain. Doraemon also appears in appeals for
   charity, the "Doraemon Fund". Doraemon toys and novelties are also
   often found in Japan, with literally thousands of items for sale.

   Doraemon, Nobita, and the other characters also appear in various
   educational manga. Doraemon is also mentioned in several anime and
   manga by other [234]mangakas.

   Doraemon is referenced in the current Blue Man Group show running in
   Tokyo. The Blue Men play a short snippet of the show's theme song, and
   one dons Doraemon's beanie.

   The Japanese guitar company, [235]ESP, makes a [236]Doraemon shaped
   guitar.

   There are nearly 50 Japanese-only video games ranging from Action
   Adventure, to RPG games, that began with the Emerson's [237]Arcadia
   2001 system. For a complete list of these games see [238]List of
   Doraemon media.

   The music video for the single "From a distance" off of the "bicycles
   and tricycles" album by ambient house act, [239]The Orb revolves around
   doraemon.

[[240]edit] Popularity

   Doraemon is a term of common knowledge in Japan. Newspapers also
   regularly make references to Doraemon and his pocket as a something
   with the ability to satisfy all wishes. Other characters in the series
   are also referenced frequently on TV shows with similar looking casts.
   Some magazines have used the analogy that America is the Takeshi of the
   world and Japan is his little brother Suneo.

   Doraemon was awarded the first [241]Shogakukan Manga Award for
   children's manga in 1982, and the first [242]Osamu Tezuka Culture Award
   in 1997.

[[243]edit] Anime

[[244]edit] Television series

   After a brief and unpopular animated series in 1973 by [245]Nippon
   Television, Doraemon remained fairly exclusive in manga form until 1979
   when a newly formed animation studio, [246]Shin-Ei Animation (Now owned
   by [247]TV Asahi) produced an anime series of Doraemon. This series
   became incredibly popular, and ended with 1,049 episodes on [248]March
   25, [249]2005.

   Celebrating Doraemon's anniversary, a new Doraemon series produced by
   [250]Studio Pierrot began airing on TV Asahi on [251]April 15,
   [252]2005 with new [253]voice actors and staff, and updated character
   designs.

[[256]edit] Feature films

          Main article: [257]List of Doraemon media

   In 1980, [258]Toho released the first of a series of annual feature
   length [259]animated films based on the lengthly special volumes
   published annually. The films are more action-adventure oriented and
   unlike the anime and manga, they have more of a [260]shnen demographic,
   taking the familiar characters of Doraemon and placing them in a
   variety of exotic and perilous settings. Nobita and his friends have
   visited the age of the [261]dinosaurs, the far reaches of the
   [262]galaxy, the heart of darkest Africa (where they encountered a race
   of sentient bipedal dogs), the depths of the ocean, and a world of
   [263]magic. Some of the films are based on [264]legends such as
   [265]Atlantis, and on [266]literary works such as [267]Journey to the
   West and [268]Arabian Nights. Some films also have serious themes,
   especially on environmental topics and the use of technology.

   The most recent Doraemon film is [269]The New Record of Nobita:
   Spaceblazer, slated for a 2009 release.

[[270]edit] Voice actors

   From 1979 to April 2005, the same five voice actors provided the main
   voices in Doraemon. However, they retired in April 2005 partially due
   to the 25th anniversary of the Doraemon television series. On
   [271]March 13, [272]2005, [273]TV Asahi announced the new voice actors
   for the five main characters:^[274][10]

[[498]edit] Significance

   On [499]22 April [500]2002, on the special issue of Asian Hero in TIME
   Magazine, Doraemon was selected as one of the 22 Asian Heroes. Being
   the only cartoon character selected, Doraemon was described as "The
   Cuddliest Hero in Asia".

   In 2005, the [501]Japan Society of New York selected Doraemon as a
   culturally significant work of Japanese [502]otaku pop-culture in its
   exhibit Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture, curated
   by renowned artist [503]Takashi Murakami. In Murakami's analysis, he
   states that Doraemon's formulaic plotlines typified the "wish
   fulfilment" mentality of 1970s Japan, where the electronics revolution
   glamorized the idea that one could solve their problems with machines
   and gadgets rather than hard work or individual
   intelligence.^[[504]citation needed]

   In 2008, the [505]Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan) appointed
   Doraemon to be as the first anime cultural ambassador[506][3][507][4].

   Despite having no official appearance in the [508]United States,
   Doraemon was influenced by a number of shows on the US-based TV
   network, [509]Nickelodeon. It is also slated to be the
   predecessor-of-sorts to [510]Butch Hartman's animated TV series,
   [511]The Fairly OddParents (which airs on the above-mentioned channel),
   and has the same plot and style of humor. Both series have also met
   with high popularity worldwide.

   In many ways, Doraemon was the first of its kind. It has been
   considered to be the prototype of the modern [512]slapstick cartoon
   series for children such as the above-mentioned The Fairly OddParents,
   [513]SpongeBob SquarePants (another US-made show made by Nickelodeon),
   and Fujiko Fujio's own bleak [514]Kiteretsu Daihyakka.
