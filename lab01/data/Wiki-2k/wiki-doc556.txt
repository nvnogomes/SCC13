   The Dutch famine of 1944 (known as hongerwinter ("Hunger winter") in
   Dutch) was a [9]famine that took place in [10]the Netherlands during
   the winter of 1944-1945, near the end of [11]World War II. A total of
   18,000 people died during the famine.^[12][1]

[[18]edit] Causes and history

   Near the end of World War II, food supplies became increasingly scarce
   in the Netherlands. After the landing of the Allied Forces on
   [19]D-Day, conditions grew worse in the [20]Nazi occupied Netherlands.
   The [21]Allies were able to liberate the southern part of the country,
   but their liberation efforts came to a halt when [22]Operation Market
   Garden, their attempt to gain control of the bridge across the
   [23]Rhine at [24]Arnhem, failed. After the national railways complied
   with the exiled Dutch government's appeal for a railway strike starting
   September 1944, to further the Allied liberation efforts, the German
   administration retaliated by placing an embargo on all food transports
   to the western Netherlands.
   Operation Manna - Many Thanks spelt-out in tulips, Holland, May 1945.

   By the time the embargo was partially lifted in early November 1944,
   allowing restricted food transports over water, the unusually early and
   harsh winter had already set in. The canals froze over and became
   impassable for barges. Food stocks in the cities in the western
   Netherlands rapidly ran out. The adult rations in cities such as
   [25]Amsterdam had dropped to below 1000 [26]kilocalories (4,200
   [27]kilojoules) a day by the end of November 1944 and to 580
   kilocalories in the West by the end of February 1945.^[28][2] Over this
   winter, later infamously known as the Hongerwinter ("Hunger winter"), a
   number of factors combined to cause starvation of the Dutch people: the
   winter itself was unusually harsh and the retreating German army
   destroyed locks and bridges to flood the country and impede the Allied
   advance. As the Netherlands became one of the main western
   battlefields, the widespread dislocation and destruction of the war
   ruined much of its agricultural land and made the transport of existing
   food stocks difficult.
   A letter of commemoration given to a grocer whose shop served as a Red
   Cross point giving out the "Swedish bread"

   In search of food people would walk for tens of kilometers to trade
   valuables for food at farms. [29]Tulip bulbs and [30]sugarbeets were
   commonly consumed. Furniture and houses were dismantled to provide fuel
   for heating. From September 1944 until early 1945 approximately the
   deaths of 10,000 Dutch people were attributed to malnutrition as the
   primary cause, many more as a contributing factor.^[31][2] The Dutch
   Famine ended with the liberation of the western Netherlands in May
   1945. Shortly before that, some relief had come from the 'Swedish
   bread', which was actually baked in the Netherlands but made from flour
   shipped in from [32]Sweden. Shortly after these droppings, the German
   occupiers allowed coordinated air droppings of food by the [33]Royal
   Air Force over German-occupied Dutch territory in [34]Operation Manna.
   The two events are often confused, even resulting in the commemoration
   of bread being dropped from airplanes, something that never happened.

[[35]edit] Scientific legacy

   This famine was unique as it took place in a modern, developed and
   literate country, albeit suffering under the privations of occupation
   and war. The well documented experience has allowed scientists to
   measure the effects of famine on human health.

   The Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study, carried out by the departments of
   Clinical [36]Epidemiology and [37]Biostatistics, [38]Gynecology and
   [39]Obstetrics and Internal Medicine of the Academic Medical Centre in
   Amsterdam, in collaboration with the MRC Environmental Epidemiology
   Unit of the [40]University of Southampton in Britain, found that the
   children of pregnant women exposed to famine were more susceptible to
   [41]diabetes, [42]obesity, cardiovascular disease, [43]microalbuminuria
   and other health problems.^[44][3]

   Moreover, the children of the women who were pregnant during the famine
   were smaller, as expected. However, surprisingly, when these children
   grew up and had children those children were also smaller than average.

   This data suggested that the famine experienced by the mothers caused
   some kind of [47]epigenetic changes that were passed down to the next
   generation.

   The discovery of the cause of [48]Coeliac disease may also be partly
   attributed to the Dutch famine. With wheat in very short supply there
   was an improvement of a children's ward of Coeliac patients. Stories
   tell of the first precious supplies of bread being given specifically
   to the (no longer) sick children, prompting an immediate relapse. Thus
   in the 1940s the Dutch [49]paediatrician Dr [50]Willem Dicke^[51][4]
   was able to corroborate his previously researched hypothesis that wheat
   intake was aggravating [52]Coeliac disease.^[53][5] Later Dicke went on
   to prove his theory.

   [54]Audrey Hepburn spent her childhood in the Netherlands during the
   famine. She suffered [55]anemia, respiratory illnesses and [56]edema as
   a result, and her [57]clinical depression later in life has been
   attributed to malnutrition.^[58][6]

   Subsequent research on the children who were affected in the second
   trimester of their mother's pregnancy, found an increased incidence of
   [59]schizophrenia in these children.^[60][7] Also increased among them
   were the rates of schizotypal personality and neurological
   defects.^[61][8]
