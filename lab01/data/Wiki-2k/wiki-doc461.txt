   Though the annual meeting of this group is denominated the The General
   Association of The Baptists, they are most widely known as the Duck
   River and Kindred Associations of Baptists. Other names associated with
   these churches are the Baptist Church of Christ, The Baptists, and
   [35]Separate Baptists (though they are not directly related to the
   [36]Separate Baptists in Christ). The primary location of the churches
   is middle [37]Tennessee and northern [38]Alabama. Members from this
   association form the largest body of [39]Baptists in [40]Moore County,
   Tennessee.

[[46]edit] History

   The history of the The General Association of The Baptists begins with
   the formation of the Duck River Association in 1826. The earliest
   church in the region was constituted circa 1790 by Kentucky ministers
   Ambrose Dudley and John Taylor. The Elk River Association was formed in
   south-central Tennessee in 1806, in the fertile valley region formed by
   the Elk and Duck Rivers. As most of the Baptists of middle Tennessee,
   the churches of the Elk River Association were strongly [47]Calvinistic
   in theology. Early in the 19th century, [48]Alexander Campbell became
   connected with the Baptists for a time, and began to preach
   [49]Arminian doctrine among them. Some Baptists of the region found
   this modification of theology appealing, and began to preach against
   limited atonement and unconditional election, declaring that Christ
   died for all mankind. The new sentiment became so strong in the Elk
   River Association that it led to division, and the Duck River
   Association of Separate Baptists was formed. The original name appears
   to have been "Duck River Baptist Association of Christ." An outspoken
   leader of the division was Elder William Keele. Others were soon
   embroiled in dispute over the new ideas, and other associations divided
   or had members withdraw from them. The majority of the Concord
   association held the more moderate Arminian position and the
   Calvinistic minority withdrew in 1827, creating two Concord
   associations. Some ministers and churches would complete their journey
   and move into the Campbell-Stone [50]restoration movement. The Duck
   River Association would maintain a Baptist course. In the following
   years, several things developed among Tennessee Baptists, including the
   Baptist State Convention in 1833, the Union University of Murfreesboro,
   and the Baptist Publication and Sunday School Society. Discussion on
   whether to support these new endeavours caused friction that split the
   Duck River Association in 1843. Those who supported these new measures
   continue as the Duck River Association of Missionary Baptists and are
   affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention and the [51]Southern
   Baptist Convention. A mind of independence, coupled with opposition to
   the Calvinistic stance of the three organizations, would keep the Duck
   River Association of Separate Baptists from supporting them. According
   to the 1844 minutes of the missionary group, the dissenters could not
   "unite with you while you retain your Calvinistic doctrine."

   The Duck River Baptists stayed their independent course and sought
   fellowship with like-minded Baptists. Through the years they developed
   correspondence with other Baptist associations - Mount Zion Association
   in 1835, Indian Creek in 1840, Union in 1848, Mount Moriah in 1851,
   Mount Pleasant circa 1860, East Union in 1890, Ebenezer and Mount Olive
   in 1891, Liberty in 1894, New Liberty in 1925, and Mount Pleasant No. 2
   in 1965. Many of these fellowships are still maintained. In October
   1939, delegates from Duck River, Mount Zion, Union, Mount Pleasant,
   Liberty, New Liberty and Ebenezer Associations, and the Pleasant Hill
   church of Kentucky, met at Garrison Fork Church, [52]Bedford County,
   Tennessee, and organized the The General Association of The Baptists.
   The stated purpose of this association is to "perpetuate a closer union
   and communion among us and to preserve and maintain a correspondence
   with each other." In 1936 there were 52 churches with 4564 members
   [Religious Bodies, 1936, Vol. II, Part 1].

[[53]edit] Faith and practice

   These "Duck River" churches are considered one of the "primitivistic"
   sects among Baptists. They are moderately Calvinistic, retaining the
   teachings of total depravity and eternal security, while asserting that
   Jesus Christ tasted death for every man. Most of the churches have
   Sunday Schools, but no organized support of missionary or benevolent
   institutions. In addition to [54]baptism and the [55]Lord's supper,
   they observe the rite of [56]feet washing as an ordinance. Services are
   informal; preaching is [57]extemporaneous. Most of the churches use
   musical instruments, though some do not, especially the northern
   Alabama churches which are heavily influenced by the [58]Sacred Harp
   style of southern folk music.

[[59]edit] Status

   The General Association of The Baptist is currently made up of seven
   associations - Duck River Association of Baptists (TN), Mt. Zion
   Association of Baptist (TN), Mt. Pleasant Association of Baptists ["No.
   1"] (AL), Mt. Pleasant Association [No. 2] of The Baptists (AL), New
   Liberty Association of United Baptists of the Primitive Order (TN),
   East Union Association of The Baptist (TN), Union Association of The
   Baptist (TN) - and one independent church - Pleasant Hill Regular
   Baptist Church of [60]Marion, Kentucky. In 2002, these represented a
   total membership of 10,393 in 97 churches.

   In addition to participation in the General Association, the local
   associations maintain correspondence with one another at their annual
   meetings. Each association is free to correspond with other like-minded
   associations that are not participating in the General Association,
   though there is no such correspondence at this time. In recent years
   there has been some interchange with the Town Creek Association of
   [61]United Baptists (AL), and a failed attempt to achieve
   correspondence with the East Washington Association of [62]Regular
   Baptists (AR).
