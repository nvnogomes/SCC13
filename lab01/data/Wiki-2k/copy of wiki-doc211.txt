   Calabria

   Calabrian wine is [9]Italian wine from the [10]Calabria region of
   southern [11]Italy. Over 90% of the region's wine production is red
   wine, with a large portion made from the [12]Gaglioppo grape. Calabria
   has 12 [13]Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions but only
   4% of the yearly production is classified as DOC wine. The region is
   one of Italy's most rural and least industrialized with [14]per capita
   income less than half of the national average.^[15][1] Following
   [16]World War II, many of Calabria's inhabitants [17]immigrated to the
   [18]United States and [19]Argentina. Those left behind have been slow
   to developed a vibrant wine industry with only the red wines of [20]Cir
   garnering much international attention. Today Calabrian wines are
   mostly produced to high [21]alcohol levels and sold to
   [22]co-operatives who transfer the wines to the northern Italian
   [23]wine regions to use as blending component. There are no
   [24]Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) regions but
   12 [25]Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) designations.^[26][2]

[[34]edit] History

   [35]Pierre Puget's 1682 sculpture of Milo of Croton at the [36]Louvre.

   The region of Calabria was first cultivated by the [37]ancient Greeks.
   The Greek athlete [38]Milo of Croton was from this region and was
   reported to drink 10 [39]liters (2.6 [40]gallons) of Cir wine each day.
   Tradition has that the wine is still made in the same way today as it
   was in Milo's time.^[41][3] During the 1st century AD, [42]Pliny the
   Elder included Calabrian wine in his listings of quality Italian
   wines.^[43][4]

[[44]edit] Climate and geography

   Calabria is located at the "toe" of the [45]Italian peninsula and is
   characterized by its [46]Mediterranean climate. To the north is the
   [47]Apennine Mountains forming the border with [48]Basilicata. The
   [49]Ionian Sea forms the eastern and southern borders followed by the
   [50]Strait of Messina (separating Calabria from [51]Sicily) and
   [52]Tyrrhenian Sea forming the western border. The winter time
   conditions in the interior are cold and harsh, with the climate near
   the coast being very hot and dry throughout most of the year. The
   majority of the region's wine production takes place in the central
   areas of the eastern and western coastlines.^[53][2]

[[54]edit] Cir

   The Cir wine region is located in the eastern [55]foothills of the
   [56]La Sila region and extends to the Ionian coast. The region's
   classico (or [57]heartland) is centered on the [58]comuni of Cir and
   [59]Cir Marina in the [60]province of Crotone. The soil of this area is
   predominantly [61]calcareous [62]marl with some [63]clay and [64]sand
   deposits. The wines of the regions are predominantly red containing at
   least 95% of the [65]Gaglioppo grape and up to 5% of the white
   [66]Greco bianco and [67]Trebbiano grapes permitted. [68]Ross and white
   wines from at least 90% Greco bianco and up to 10% Trebbiano are also
   made in Cir but in very limited quantities. While a common [69]synonym
   of Trebbiano is Greco, the grape is separate and distinct from the
   Calabrian wine grape Greco bianco. The designation of Cir classico will
   only appear on red wines. Red Cir is typically very [70]tannic and
   [71]full bodied with strong fruit presences. It is often meant to be
   consumed 3-4 years after [72]vintage but can take more time to soften
   the tannins.^[73][2] It is said that Cir was offered to winners of the
   ancient Olympics ^[74][5].

[[75]edit] Other wine regions

   Provinces of Calabria

   Of the remaining 11 DOC regions, [76]Melissa and [77]Isola di Capo
   Rizzuto are located near Cir along the Ionian coast. In the far
   southern [78]province of Reggio Calabria are the [79]Bianco and
   [80]Bivongi regions. The western wine regions are located in the
   [81]provinces of Catanzaro and [82]Cosenza. They include the DOCs of
   [83]Donnici, [84]Lamezia Terme, [85]Pollino, [86]San Vito di Luzzi,
   [87]Savuto, [88]Scavigna and [89]Verbicaro.^[90][2]
     * Bianco- The DOC of Greco di Bianco is one of the few predominant
       white wine regions in Calabria. The area produces most [91]sweet
       wine from the Greco Bianco grape that have alcohol contents of at
       least 17%. The wines are typically produced as [92]straw wines with
       the grapes being partially dried prior to [93]pressing and
       [94]fermentation. Greco di Bianco is characterized by a deep
       [95]amber color and aromas of [96]citrus and [97]herbs.^[98][2]
     * Bivongi-The DOC of Bivongi is one of Calabria's newest DOCs and
       produces red and ros wines from blends of Gaglioppo, [99]Greco
       Nero, [100]Nocera, [101]Castiglione and [102]Calabrese. The few
       white wines made in this region are dry wines made from a blend of
       Greco Bianco, [103]Guardavalle, [104]Mantonico Bianco,
       [105]Malvasia Bianca and [106]Ansonica as well as up to 30% of
       other available white [107]grape varieties.^[108][2]
     * Donnici- The Domnici DOC is located south of [109]Cosenza on the
       wester slopes of the La Sila [110]plateau. The production is mainly
       red wine made from Gaglioppo with some blending of Greco Nero and
       Mantonico Nero.^[111][2]
     * Isola di Capo Rizzuto- The DOC of Sant'Anna di Isola di Capo
       Rizzuto is located south of commune of Melissa. The region was once
       an [112]island but overtime the [113]marshland around it filled in
       and connected the region to the mainland. The DOC produces dry red
       and ros wines from Gaglioppo, Nocera, [114]Nerello Mascalese (and
       the related Nerello Cappuccio), and up to 35% of added Malvasia and
       Greco Bianco.^[115][2]
     * Lamezia Terme- The DOC of Lamezia is located on the plains and hill
       side regions around the [116]Gulf of Sant'Eufemia near the
       [117]Sant'Eufemia d'Aspromonte along the Tyrrhenian Sea. The region
       is very warm, allowing the grapes to fully ripen and develop body
       and alcohol levels. The region produces red and ros wines from
       Gaglioppo, Nerello Mascalese, Nerello Cappuccio, Greco Nero,
       [118]Magliocco and [119]Marsigliana. The white wines from the
       region are made from Greco Bianco, Malvasia Bianca and
       Trebbiano.^[120][2]
     * Melissa-The Melissa DOC is located south of Cir and produces wines
       of similar style, though not with the same international reputation
       of quality. The red wine grapes of the region are the Gaglioppo and
       Greco Nera with some blending of the white wine grapes Greco
       Bianco, Malvasia Bianca and Trebbiano.^[121][2]
     * Pollino- The Pollino DOC is named for the nearby mountain range
       that forms part of the Apennines. Located near the border with
       Basilicata, the region produces pale, cherry red wines that need
       2-3 years to develop. The wines are made primarily with Gaglioppo
       and Greco Nero with up to 20% of white grape varieties permitted in
       the blend.^[122][2]
     * San Vito di Luzzi- The DOC of San Vito di Luzzi is located in the
       [123]hamlet of San Vito near the commune of [124]Luzzi. The red and

       white wine varieties.^[126][2]
     * Savuto- The Savuto DOC is located south of the Donnici region in
       mountainous terrain that stretches to the coast. The vineyards
       located closer to the interior are cooler than other parts of
       Calabria, producing wines with lower alcohol levels. The red and
       ros wines from this region are produced with Gaglioppo, Greco Nero,
       Nerello Cappuccio, Magliocco, Sangiovese and up to 25% of the white
       wine grapes Malvasia Bianca and [127]Pecorello.^[128][2]
     * Scavigna- The Scavigna DOC is located south of Savuto on the
       western coast of Calabria. The dry red and ros wines from this
       region are made with at least 60% Gaglioppo and Nerello Cappuccio
       with a blend of other local red wine varieties. The white wines are
       blend of Trebbiano, [129]Chardonnay, Greco Bianco and Malvasia
       Bianca.^[130][2]

       Pollino foothills, west of Pollino DOC region and extends to the
       Tyrrhenian coast. The dry dry red and ros wines from this region
       are made from Gaglioppo and Greco Nero with a small amount of the
       white wine grapes Greco Bianco, Malvasia Bianca and [131]Guarnaccia
       Bianca blended in. Those same white grapes also produces the
       limited amount of Verbicaro Bianco.^[132][2]
