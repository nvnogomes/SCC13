   A Cynocephalus. From the [9]Nuremberg Chronicle ([10]1493).

          (disambiguation).

   The condition of cynocephaly, having the head of a [12]dog or of a
   [13]jackal is a widely attested legendary phenomenon existing in many
   different forms and contexts. The word is taken from Latin cynocephalus
   "dog-head", which derives from [14]Greek: .

[[28]edit] Ancient Greece and Egypt

   Cynocephaly was familiar to the [29]Ancient Greeks from representations
   of the Egyptian god [30]Hapy, the son of [31]Horus. There was also an
   Egyptian baboon god in the Early Dynastic period. The Greek word
   ([32]Greek: ) "dog-head" also identified a sacred [33]Egyptian
   [34]baboon with the face of a dog.^[35][1]

   Reports of dog-headed races can also be traced back to Greek Antiquity.
   In the fifth century BC, the Greek physician [36]Ctesias wrote a
   detailed report on the existence of Cynocephali in India.^[37][2].
   Similarly, the Greek traveller [38]Megasthenes claims to know about
   dog-headed people in India who live in the mountains, communicate
   through barking, wear the skins of wild animals and live off
   hunting.^[39][3]

[[40]edit] Medieval East

   Cynocephali also figure in Christian world-views. A legend that placed
   [41]St. Andrew and [42]St. Bartholomew among the [43]Parthians
   presented the case of "Abominable," the citizen of the "city of
   cannibals... whose face was like unto that of a dog." After receiving
   baptism, however, he was released from his doggish aspect.^[44][4]
   Cynocephalus St. Christopher

[[45]edit] Saint Christopher

   In the [46]Eastern Orthodox Church, certain icons covertly identify
   [47]Saint Christopher with the head of a dog. The background to the
   dog-headed Christopher is laid in the reign of the Emperor
   [48]Diocletian, when a man named Reprebus, Rebrebus or Reprobus (the
   "reprobate" or "scoundrel") was captured in combat against tribes
   dwelling to the west of [49]Egypt in [50]Cyrenaica. To the unit of
   soldiers, according to the [51]hagiographic narrative, was assigned the
   name numerus Marmaritarum or "Unit of the Marmaritae", which suggests
   an otherwise-unidentified "Marmaritae" (perhaps the same as the
   Marmaricae [52]Berber tribe of [53]Cyrenaica). He was reported to be of
   enormous size, with the head of a dog instead of a man, apparently a
   characteristic of the Marmaritae.

   The German bishop and poet [54]Walter of Speyer portrayed St.
   Christopher as a giant of a cynocephalic species in the land of the
   Chananeans (the "canines" of [55]Canaan in the New Testament) who ate
   human flesh and barked. Eventually, Christopher met the Christ child,
   regretted his former behavior, and received baptism. He, too, was
   rewarded with a human appearance, whereupon he devoted his life to
   Christian service and became an [56]athlete of God, one of the
   [57]soldier-saints.^[58][5]

[[60]edit] Late Antiquity

   The "cynocephali" offered such an evocative image of the magic and
   brutality deemed characteristic of bizarre people of distant places,
   that it kept returning in medieval literature. A number of late antique
   and medieval scholars reported on the Cynocephalae, sometimes with the
   aplomb of anthropologists:
     * [61]Augustine
     * [62]Isidore of Seville

[[63]edit] Medieval West

     * [64]Paul the Deacon: "They pretend that they have in their camps
       Cynocephali, that is, men with dogs' heads. They spread the rumor
       among the enemy that these men wage war obstinately, drink human
       blood and quaff their own gore if they cannot reach the foe."
       ^[65][6]
     * The ninth-century Frankish theologian [66]Ratramnus wrote a letter,
       the Epistola de Cynocephalis, on whether the Cynocephali should be
       considered human.^[67][7]
     * [68]Adam of Bremen,
     * Quoting St. Jerome, [69]Thomas of Cantimpr corroborated the
       existence of Cynocephali, in his Liber de Monstruosis Hominibus
       Orientis, xiv, ("Book of Monstrous men of the [70]Orient").
     * The thirteenth-century encyclopedist [71]Vincent of Beauvais
       acquainted his patron St. [72]Louis IX of France with "an animal
       with the head of the dog but with all other members of human
       appearance... Though he behaves like a man... and, when peaceful,
       he is tender like a man, when furious, he becomes cruel and
       retaliates on humankind" (Speculum naturale, 31:126).

     * In Anglo-Saxon England, the Old English word wulfes heafod wolfs
       head was a technical term for an outlaw, who could be killed as if
       he were a wolf. The so-called [73]Leges Edwardi Confessoris,
       written in c 1140, however, offered a somewhat literal
       interpretation: [6.2a] For from the day of his outlawry he bears a
       wolfs head, which is called wluesheued by the English. [6.2b] And
       this sentence is the same for all outlaws.

   ^[74][8]

[[75]edit] High and late medieval travel literature

   Medieval travellers [76]Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and [77]Marco Polo
   both mention cynocephali. Giovanni writes of the armies of [78]Ogedei
   Khan who encounter a race of dogheads who live north of the Dalai-Nor
   (Northern Ocean), or [79]Lake Baikal ^[80][9]. Polo's Travels mention
   the dog-headed barbarians on the island of Angamanain, or the
   [81]Andaman Islands. For Polo, although these people grow spices, they
   are none the less cruel and "are all just like big mastiff dogs"
   ^[82][10].

   According to [83]Henri Cordier, the source of all the fables of the
   dog-headed barbarians, whether European, Arabic, or Chinese, can be
   found in the [84]Alexander Romance.^[85][11]

[[86]edit] China

   Additionally, in the [87]Chinese record History of the [88]Liang
   Dynasty ([89]Liang Shu), the [90]Buddhist missionary Hui-Sheng
   describes an island of dog-headed men to the east of [91]Fusang, a
   nation he visited variously identified as [92]Japan or the
   [93]Americas. While the '[94]History of Northern Dynasties' of Li
   Yanshou, a T'Ang Dynasty historian, also mentions the 'dog kingdom'.

[[95]edit] Modern appearances

   The use of dog-headed, human-bodied characters is still very strong in
   modern literature. In the domain of [96]comics publishing in [97]North
   America and in [98]Europe many works feature an "all-cynocephalic" cast
   or use the heads of dogs and other animals together for social comment
   or other purposes. For instance, in the [99]Pulitzer Prize winning
   graphic novel [100]Maus by [101]Art Spiegelman, [102]Jews have human
   bodies and the heads of mice while characters with their roots in the
   United States have human bodies and the heads of dogs, Germans have the
   heads of cats, and the French have the heads of frogs. Dog-headed
   creatures based on the ancient accounts appear in many modern
   [103]role-playing games, beginning with the [104]Gnolls of
   [105]Dungeons & Dragons.

[[109]edit] Other dog-headed creatures in legend

     * The Chinese mythology of [110]Fu Xi included variations where he
       had a dogs head, or he and his sister [111]Nu Wa had ugly faces.
     * The [112]Egyptian god [113]Anubis.
     * In the [114]USA there are tales of dog-headed creatures, including
       the Dogman of [115]Michigan, and the wolf-like [116]Beast of Bray
       Road of [117]Wisconsin, which terrorised a neighbourhood in the
       early 1990s.

       Mandeville.
