   A virtual Easter egg is an intentional [39]hidden message, [40]in-joke
   or feature in an object such as a [41]movie, [42]book, [43]CD, [44]DVD,
   [45]computer program, [46]web page or [47]video game. The term draws a
   parallel with the custom of the [48]Easter egg hunt observed in many
   [49]Western nations, but actually is derived by the practice of the
   last Russian imperial family's tradition of giving elaborately jeweled
   egg-shaped creations by [50]Faberg which usually contained hidden gifts
   themselves.^[51][1]

   This practice is similar in some respects to hidden signature motifs
   such as [52]Diego Rivera including himself in his murals, [53]Alfred
   Hitchcock's legendary [54]cameo appearances, and various "[55]Hidden
   Mickeys" that can be found throughout [56]Disneyland. An early example
   of these kind of "Easter eggs" is [57]Al Hirschfeld's "Nina".

   [58]Atari's [59]Adventure, released in 1979, contained what was thought
   to be the first video game "Easter egg", the name of the programmer
   ([60]Warren Robinett). However, evidence of earlier Easter eggs has
   since surfaced. Several cartridges for the [61]Fairchild Channel F
   include previously unknown Easter eggs, programmed by Michael Glass and
   Brad Reid-Selth, that are believed to predate Robinett's
   work.^[62][2]^[63][3]

[[74]edit] Computer-related Easter eggs

[[75]edit] Software-based

   Easter eggs are messages, videos, graphics, sound effects, or an
   unusual change in program behavior that sometimes occur in a software
   program in response to some undocumented set of commands, mouse clicks,
   keystrokes or other stimuli intended as a joke or to display program
   credits.

   They are often located in the "About" box of a software. For example,
   two easter eggs exist in the "About" box of Adobe Photoshop 7: an
   alternative "Liquid Sky" splash screen and the ability to speed up
   credits to view funny quotations.^[[76]citation needed]

   An early use of the term Easter egg was to describe a message hidden in
   the [77]object code of a program as a joke, intended to be found by
   persons disassembling or browsing the code.^[[78]citation needed]

   Easter eggs found in some [79]Unix [80]operating systems caused them to
   respond to the command "[81]make love" with "not war?" and "why" with
   "why not" (a reference to [82]The Prisoner in [83]Berkeley Unix 1977).
   The TOPS-10 operating system (for the DEC PDP-10 computer) had the
   "make love" hack before 1971; it included a short, thoughtful pause
   before the response. This same behavior occurred on the [84]RSTS/E
   operating system where the command "make" was used to invoke the
   [85]TECO editor, and TECO would also provide this response.
   [86]Screenshot of [87]Stickies (version 1.0.4 for [88]Mac OS 9) Easter
   egg. The Easter Egg is shown by typing Antler! and then, typing
   [89]Return

   The largest Easter egg is purported to be in the Atari 400/800 version
   of [90]Pitfall II: Lost Caverns, which contains an entire game that was
   more complex and challenging than the original Pitfall
   II.^[[91]citation needed]

   Many [92]personal computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in
   [93]ROM, including lists of the developers' names, political
   exhortations, snatches of music, and (in one case) images of the entire
   development team. Easter eggs in the 1997 version of [94]Microsoft
   Office include a hidden [95]flight simulator^[96][4]^[97][5] in
   [98]Microsoft Excel and a [99]pinball game^[100][6] in [101]Word (see
   [102]Easter eggs in Microsoft products).

   The [103]Palm operating system has elaborately hidden animations and
   other surprises.^[[104]citation needed] The Debian GNU/Linux package
   tool [105]apt-get has an Easter egg involving an [106]ASCII cow when
   variants on "apt-get moo" are typed into the shell.^[[107]citation
   needed]

   An Easter Egg is found on all^[[108]citation needed] Microsoft Windows
   Operating Systems prior to XP. In the 3D Text [109]screen saver,
   entering the text "volcano" will display the names of all the known
   volcanoes that exist in the world. Microsoft removed this Easter Egg in
   [110]XP but added others. One which continues till Windows XP is to
   simultaneously hold the [111]Alt, [112]shift, and the number 2 keys in
   the [113]Solitaire game to produce a forced win.^[114][7]

   An early version of Microsoft Excel contained a hidden [115]Doom-like
   action game called "The Hall of Tortured Souls".^[[116]citation needed]
   Windows 3.1 has a hidden developer credits page, which can be accessed
   by following a sequence of right-clicking and entering code words which
   is passed around by word-of-mouth.^[[117]citation needed]

   The tradition of easter eggs remains strong,^[[118]citation needed]
   including in more recent system software. For example, every version of
   [119]HP Integrity Virtual Machines added new easter eggs, including the
   ability to translate the output of guest operating systems in
   "Gnomish", a "legacy mode" paying tribute to discontinued HP products,
   or a hidden hpvmtunes command that is supposed to be similar to
   [120]iTunes.^[[121]citation needed] These easter eggs were never
   removed, because they all have been engineered to have an actual
   purpose. The legacy mode, for example, can be used to intercept system
   errors, and the hpvmtunes command can be used to collect and analyze
   performance data.^[[122]citation needed]

   Several computer based lighting control desks are known to have Easter
   Egg games built in. For instance, the Zero88 FatFrog lighting desk has
   a copy of the Frogger game installed. This is accessible by having an
   external monitor and keyboard plugged in, and hitting the F1 and F3
   keys simultaneously.^[[123]citation needed]

[[124]edit] Non-software

   While computer-related Easter eggs are often found in [125]software,
   occasionally they exist in [126]hardware or [127]firmware of certain
   devices. On some [128]PCs, the [129]BIOS [130]ROM contains Easter eggs.
   Notable examples include several early [131]Apple Macintosh models
   which had pictures of the development team in the ROM (accessible by
   pressing the programmer's switch and jumping to a specific memory
   address, or other equally obscure means), and some errant 1993 AMI
   [132]BIOS that on [133]13 November proceeded to play "Happy Birthday"
   via the PC speaker over and over again instead of booting. Similarly,
   the [134]Radio Shack [135]Color Computer 3's ROM contained code which
   would display the likenesses of three [136]Microware developers on a
   <ctrl><alt><reset> keypress sequence - a hard reset which would discard
   any information currently in the dynamic memory.^[137][8]

   Perhaps the most famous example of a hardware Easter egg is in the
   [138]HP ScanJet 5P, where the device will play the [139]Ode to Joy or
   [140]Fr Elise by varying the [141]stepper motor speed if users power
   the device up with the scan button depressed. This is achieved through
   software intervention.^[[142]citation needed]

   Another Easter egg is found in the [143]Kurzweil K2x musical keyboard
   series ([144]K2500, [145]K2600 and others): if users type "Pong" while
   in search mode they can play the game [146]Pong.^[[147]citation needed]

   The EEPROM of Nagra smart cards for the [148]Dish Network
   [149]satellite television system contain the phrase "NipPEr Is a buTt
   liCkeR". Nipper was a hacker who broke old security routines on the
   cards, and this text is included as a fallback to old security
   routines, where the phrase was hashed against an input text to verify
   the card.^[[150]citation needed]

   Several [151]oscilloscopes have contained Easter eggs. One example is
   the HP 54622D, known to have an [152]Asteroids clone (and even to save
   high scores in [153]NV-RAM).^[154][9]

[[155]edit] Chip and PCB-based Easter eggs

          Main article: [156]Chip art

   Many [157]integrated circuit (chip) designers have included [158]hidden
   artwork, including assorted images, phrases, developer initials, logos,
   and so on. This artwork, like the rest of the chip, is reproduced in
   each copy by [159]lithography and [160]etching. These are visible only
   when the chip package is opened and examined under magnification, so
   they are, in a sense, more of an "[161]inside joke" than most of the
   Easter eggs included in software.^[[162]citation needed]

   Originally, the Easter eggs served a useful purpose as well. Not unlike
   [163]cartographers who may insert [164]trap streets or nonexistent
   [165]landscape features as a [166]copyright infringement detection aid,
   IC designers may also build non-functional circuits on their chips to
   help them catch infringers. Easter eggs, however benign, if directly
   copied by the [167]defendant, could be used in [168]mask work
   infringement litigation. Changes to the copyright laws (in the USA, the
   [169]Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, and similar laws in
   other countries) now grant automatic exclusive rights to [170]mask
   works, and the Easter egg no longer serves any practical use.

   [171]Western Digital's [172]MyBook Pro has several words on the metal
   band that wraps around 3 sides in [173]Morse Code.^[174][10] The code
   reads:
PERSONALRELIABLEINNOVATIVESIMPLE
INNOVATIVEPERSONALDESIGNRELIABLE
INNOVATIVEDESIGNPERSONALDESIGN
SIMPLEINNOVATIVE

   Most [175]Bungie product boxes have anagrams on the
   bottom.^[[176]citation needed]

   The [177]Commodore [178]Amiga models 500, 600 and 1200 each featured
   Easter eggs, in the form of titles of songs by [179]The B-52's etched
   on the [180]motherboards. The 500 says "[181]Rock Lobster", the 600
   says "[182]June Bug", and the 1200 says "[183]Channel Z". The
   [184]Amiga OS software includes a variety of hidden messages as
   well.^[185][11]

   Several models of [186]S3 Trio 64v+ graphics cards have lyrics of songs
   by [187]The Beatles printed faintly along the edge of the
   card.^[[188]citation needed]

   The circuit board under the bottom most plate of HP LaserJet 1100
   printer has the following text printed on it: "This Product is
   Dedicated in Memory of our Good Friend Ming-Zen Kuo".^[[189]citation
   needed]

[[190]edit] Easter eggs on DVDs

   Easter eggs are also found on movie [191]DVDs. In some cases, an extra
   click to the right or left, or going up in the menu instead of going
   down to select a choice will bring up a hidden feature, including
   [192]concept art, humorous [193]outtakes, or [194]deleted
   scenes.^[195][12]

[[196]edit] Security concerns

   Because of the increase in [197]malware, many companies and government
   offices forbid the use of software containing Easter eggs for security
   reasons. With the rise of [198]cybercrime and the prevalence of the
   Easter egg's "cousin", the [199]logic bomb, there is now concern that
   if the programmer could slip in undocumented code, then the software
   cannot be trusted. This is of particular concern in offices where
   personal or confidential information is stored, making it sensitive to
   theft and [200]ransom. For this reason, many developers have stopped
   the practice of adding Easter eggs to their software. Microsoft, who
   has in the past created some of the largest and most elaborate Easter
   eggs such as the ones in [201]Microsoft Office, no longer allows Easter
   eggs in their software as part of their [202]Trustworthy Computing
   initiative.^[203][13]

[[204]edit] In fiction

   A DVD easter egg is a plot point in "[205]Blink", a 2007 episode of the
   science fiction series [206]Doctor Who. Appropriately enough, the
   actual video footage used for the easter egg is included as an easter
   egg with the episode on its DVD box set release.^[207][14]
