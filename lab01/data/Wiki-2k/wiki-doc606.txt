   Benzoic Acid Crystals

   Benzoic acid, C[7]H[6]O[2] (or C[6]H[5]COOH), is a colorless
   crystalline solid and the simplest [69]aromatic [70]carboxylic acid.
   The name derived from [71]gum benzoin, which was for a long time the
   only source for benzoic acid. This weak acid and its salts are used as
   a food preservative. Benzoic acid is an important precursor for the
   synthesis of many other organic substances.

[[92]edit] History

   Benzoic acid was discovered in the 16th century. The [93]dry
   distillation of [94]gum benzoin first described by [95]Nostradamus
   (1556), and subsequently by [96]Alexius Pedemontanus (1560) and
   [97]Blaise de Vigenre (1596).^[98][2]

   [99]Justus von Liebig and [100]Friedrich Whler determined the structure
   of benzoic acid in 1832.^[101][3] They also investigated how
   [102]hippuric acid is related to benzoic acid.

   In 1875 Salkowski discovered the [103]antifungal abilities of benzoic
   acid, which was used for a long time in the preservation of
   benzoate-containing [104]cloudberry fruits.^[105][4]

[[106]edit] Production

[[107]edit] Industrial preparations

   Benzoic acid is produced commercially by partial oxidation of
   [108]toluene with [109]oxygen. The process is catalyzed by [110]cobalt
   or [111]manganese [112]naphthenates. The process uses cheap raw
   materials, proceeds in high yield, and is considered environmentally
   green.

   [113]toluene oxidation

   U.S. production capacity is estimated to be 126,000 [114]tonnes per
   year (139,000 tons), much of which is consumed domestically to prepare
   other industrial chemicals.

[[115]edit] Laboratory synthesis

   Benzoic acid is cheap and readily available, so the laboratory
   synthesis of benzoic acid is mainly practiced for its pedagogical
   value. It is a common undergraduate preparation.

   For all syntheses, benzoic acid can be purified by recrystallization
   from water because of its high solubility in hot water and poor
   solubility in cold water. The avoidance of organic solvents for the
   recrystallization makes this experiment particularly safe. Other
   possible recrystallization solvents include [116]acetic acid
   ([117]anhydrous or aqueous), [118]benzene, petroleum ether, and a
   mixture of ethanol and water.^[119][5]

[[120]edit] By hydrolysis

   Like any other [121]nitrile or [122]amide, [123]benzonitrile and
   [124]benzamide can be hydrolyzed to benzoic acid or its conjugate base
   in acid or basic conditions.

[[125]edit] From benzaldehyde

   The base-induced [126]disproportionation of [127]benzaldehyde, the
   [128]Cannizzaro reaction, affords equal amounts of benzoate and
   [129]benzyl alcohol; the latter can be removed by [130]distillation.

[[131]edit] From bromobenzene

   [132]Bromobenzene can be converted to benzoic acid by "carbonation" of
   the intermediate [133]phenylmagnesium bromide:^[134][6]

          C[6]H[5]MgBr + CO[2] C[6]H[5]CO[2]MgBr
          C[6]H[5]CO[2]MgBr + HCl C[6]H[5]CO[2]H + MgBrCl

[[135]edit] From benzyl alcohol

   [136]Benzyl alcohol is refluxed with potassium permanganate or other
   oxidizing reagents in water. The mixture is hot filtered to remove
   manganese dioxide and then allowed to cool to afford benzoic acid.

[[137]edit] Historical preparations

   The first industrial process involved the reaction of
   [138]benzotrichloride (trichloromethyl benzene) with [139]calcium
   hydroxide in water, using [140]iron or [141]iron salts as
   [142]catalyst. The resulting [143]calcium benzoate is converted to
   benzoic acid with [144]hydrochloric acid. The product contains
   significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this
   reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry
   distillation of gum benzoin. Food-grade benzoic acid is now produced
   synthetically.^[145][7]

   [146]Alkyl substituted [147]benzene derivatives give benzoic acid with
   the stoichiometric oxidants [148]potassium permanganate, [149]chromium
   trioxide, [150]nitric acid.

[[151]edit] Uses

[[152]edit] Food preservative

   Benzoic acid and its salts are used as a food [153]preservative,
   represented by the [154]E-numbers [155]E210, [156]E211, [157]E212, and
   [158]E213. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of [159]mold,
   [160]yeast^[161][8] and some [162]bacteria. It is either added directly
   or created from reactions with its [163]sodium, [164]potassium, or
   [165]calcium salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic
   acid in to the cell. If the intracellular [166]pH changes to 5 or
   lower, the [167]anaerobic fermentation of [168]glucose through
   [169]phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic
   acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food.^[170][9]
   Acidic food and beverage like [171]fruit juice ([172]citric acid),
   sparkling drinks ([173]carbon dioxide), [174]soft drinks
   ([175]phosphoric acid), [176]pickles ([177]vinegar) or other acidified
   food are preserved with benzoic acid and benzoates.

   Typical levels of use for benzoic acid as a preservative in food are
   between 0.05 0.1%. Foods in which benzoic acid may be used and maximum
   levels for its application are laid down in international food
   law.^[178][10]^[179][11]

   Concern has been expressed that benzoic acid and its salts may react
   with [180]ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in some soft drinks, forming small
   quantities of [181]benzene.^[182][12]

          See also: [183]Benzene in soft drinks

[[184]edit] Feedstock

   Benzoic acid is used to make a large number of chemicals, important
   examples of which are:
     * [185]Benzoyl chloride, C[6]H[5]C(O)Cl, is obtained by treatment of
       benzoic with [186]thionyl chloride, [187]phosgene or one of the
       [188]chlorides of phosphorus. C[6]H[5]C(O)Cl is an important
       starting material for several benzoic acid derivates like
       [189]benzyl benzoate, which is used in [190]artificial flavours and
       [191]insect repellents.
     * Benzoate [192]plasticizers, such as the glycol-, diethylengylcol-,
       and triethyleneglycol esters, are obtained by
       [193]transesterification of [194]methyl benzoate with the
       corresponding [195]diol. Alternatively these species arise by
       treatment of benzoylchloride with the diol. These plasticizers are
       used similarly to those derived from terephthalic acid ester.
     * [196]Phenol, C[6]H[5]OH, is obtained by oxidative
       [197]decarboxylation at 300-400C. The temperature required can be
       lowered to 200C by the addition of catalytic amounts of
       [198]copper(II) salts. The phenol can be converted to
       [199]cyclohexanol, which is a starting material for [200]nylon
       synthesis.

[[201]edit] Medicinal

   Benzoic acid is a constituent of [202]Whitfield's Ointment which is
   used for the treatment of fungal skin diseases such as tinea,
   [203]ringworm, and [204]athlete's foot. ^[205][13] ^[206][14]

[[207]edit] Biology and health effects

   Benzoic acid occurs naturally free and bound as benzoic acid esters in
   many plant and animal species. Appreciable amounts have been found in
   most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several [208]Vaccinium
   species (e.g., [209]cranberry, V. vitis idaea; [210]bilberry, V.
   macrocarpon) contain as much as 300-1300 mg free benzoic acid per kg
   fruit. Benzoic acid is also formed in [211]apples after infection with
   the fungus [212]Nectria galligena. Among animals, benzoic acid has been
   identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in
   viscera and muscles of the [213]ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) as well as in
   gland secretions of male [214]muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) or Asian bull
   elephants ([215]Elephas maximus).^[216][15]

   [217]Gum benzoin contains up to 20% of benzoic acid and 40% benzoic
   acid esters.^[218][16]

   Benzoic acid is present as part of [219]hippuric acid
   (N-Benzoylglycine) in [220]urine of [221]mammals, especially
   [222]herbivores (Gr. hippos = horse; ouron = urine). Humans produce
   about 0.44 g/L [223]hippuric acid per day in their urine, and if the
   person is exposed to [224]toluene or benzoic acid it can rise above
   that level.^[225][17]

   For humans, the WHO's International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS)
   suggests a provisional tolerable intake would be 5 mg/kg body weight
   per day.^[226][15] [227]Cats have a significantly lower tolerance
   against benzoic acid and its [228]salts than [229]rats and [230]mice.
   Lethal dose for cats can be as low as 300 mg/kg body weight.^[231][18]
   The oral [232]LD[50] for [233]rats is 3040 mg/kg, for [234]mice [235]it
   is 1940-2263 mg/kg.^[236][15]

[[237]edit] Chemistry

   Reactions of benzoic acid can occur at either the [238]aromatic ring or
   the [239]carboxyl group:

[[240]edit] Aromatic ring

   [241]benzoic acid aromatic ring reactions

   [242]Electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction will take place
   mainly in 3-position to the [243]electron-withdrawing [244]carboxylic
   group; i.e. benzoic acid is [245]meta directing.

   The second substitution reaction (on the right) is slower because the
   first nitro group is deactivating.^[246][19] Conversely, if an
   activating group (electron-donating) was introduced (e.g., alkyl), a
   second substitution reaction would occur more readily than the first
   and the disubstituted product might not accumulate to a significant
   extent.

[[247]edit] Carboxyl group

   All the reactions mentioned for [248]carboxylic acids are also possible
   for benzoic acid.
     * Benzoic acid [249]esters are the product of the acid catalysed
       reaction with [250]alcohols.
     * Benzoic acid [251]amides are more easily available by using
       activated acid derivatives (such as [252]benzoyl chloride) or by
       coupling reagents used in [253]peptide synthesis like [254]DCC and
       [255]DMAP.
     * The more active benzoic [256]anhydride is formed by dehydration
       using [257]acetic anhydride or [258]phosphorus pentoxide.
     * Highly reactive acid derivatives such as [259]acid halides are
       easily obtained by mixing with [260]halogenation agents like
       [261]phosphorus chlorides or [262]thionyl chloride.
     * [263]Orthoesters can be obtained by the reaction of [264]alcohols
       under acidic water free conditions with [265]benzonitrile.
     * Reduction to [266]benzaldehyde and [267]benzyl alcohol is possible
       using [268]DIBAL-H, [269]LiAlH[4] or [270]sodium borohydride.
     * The copper catalysed [271]decarboxylation of [272]benzoate to
       benzene may be effected by heating in [273]quinoline. Also,
       Hunsdiecker decarboxylation can be achieved by forming the silver
       salt and heating.
