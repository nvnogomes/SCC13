   tienne-Gaspard Robert
   Born 1763
   [9]Lige, [10]Belgium
   Died 1837
   [11]Paris, [12]France
   Nationality [13]Belgian
   Other names Robertson
   Occupation [14]Stage magician, [15]physicist and [16]balloonist

   tienne-Gaspard Robert (17631837), often known by the stage name of
   "Robertson", was a prominent [17]Belgian [18]stage magician and
   influential developer of [19]phantasmagoria. He was described by
   [20]Charles Dickens as "an honourable and well-educated
   showman".^[21][1] Alongside his pioneering work on projection
   techniques for his shows Robert was also a physics lecturer and a keen
   [22]balloonist at a time of great development in aviation.

[[31]edit] Early work

   Born in [32]Lige Robert studied at [33]Leuven and became a professor of
   [34]physics specialising in [35]optics. He was an avid painter and
   intended to move to France to pursue a career in art. He moved to Paris
   in the 1790s and maintained a living as a painter and draughtsman.
   While there he attended lectures in [36]natural science at the
   [37]Collge de France as well as those by [38]Jacques Charles, a fellow
   scientist and important figure in ballooning history.^[39][1]

   In 1796, during the [40]French Revolution and three years after the
   declaration of war between France and Great Britain, Robert met with
   the French government and proposed a method of burning the invading
   ships of the British [41]Royal Navy. Based on the myth of the
   [42]mirrors of Archimedes he wanted to employ enormous [43]mirrors to
   direct intense amounts of sunlight onto the approaching vessels. The
   government turned down his suggestion.^[44][1]^[45][2]^[46][3]

   Robert experimented with various areas of physics, giving public
   demonstrations about his research into [47]galvanism and optics in the
   1790s and early 1800s.^[48][3]

[[49]edit] Phantasmagoria

   Robert attended a new form of [50]illusion performance in 1793 in the
   form of a magic lantern show by [51]Paul de Philipsthal. Philipsthal
   was one of the earliest known performers of such shows and, with his
   understanding of optics, Robert realised the potential of what would
   become "[52]phantasmagoria". His skills in painting would also prove to
   be a significant asset in the development of his new-found
   obsession.^[53][1]

[[54]edit] Fantoscope

   Robert read the works of 17th-century scholar [55]Athanasius Kircher
   and was particularly interested in the [56]magic lantern, an early form
   of [57]slide projector. He created his own version of the device with
   several improvements, adding adjustable lenses and a moveable carriage
   system that would allow the operator to change the size of the
   projected image. He also made it possible to project several different
   images at once using more than one painted glass slider. The resultant
   display had a very ghostly effect especially when in a smoky
   atmosphere. Through this the operator had the ability to manipulate
   images projected from an unseen location.^[58][4] In 1799, after
   further refining the system, he received a patent for his "magic
   lantern on wheels", naming it the Fantoscope.

[[59]edit] Shows

     I am only satisfied if my spectators, shivering and shuddering, raise
          their hands or cover their eyes out of fear of ghosts and devils
                                                      dashing towards them

                                            tienne-Gaspard Robert ^[60][3]

   Robert developed a phantasmagoria show based around his projection
   system and the use of other effects and techniques. Robert scripted
   scenes that involved actors and [61]ventriloquism alongside his
   projections, creating a convincing impression of the appearance of
   ghosts.^[62][5] Robert used several projection devices in a variety of
   ways, including [63]rear projection and projection onto large pieces of
   wax-coated [64]gauze (giving the image a more translucent
   appearance).^[65][2] He also used smoke and mirrors to further disguise
   the mechanisms behind his show. His painting skills allowed him to
   create accurate depictions of famous French heroes such as
   [66]Jean-Paul Marat, [67]Voltaire, and [68]Jean-Jacques
   Rousseau.^[69][1]^[70][3]

   Robert appeared at the Pavillon de l'Echiquier on [71]23 January
   [72]1798 and performed his first show.^[73][1] His charisma and the
   never-before-seen visual effects left the audience convinced that they
   had seen real ghosts, with many left terrified by the performance.

   After being investigated by the authorities, Robert's show was shut
   down in Paris. He moved to [74]Bordeaux and continued to perform,
   before returning to Paris a few weeks later. It was during this trip to
   Bordeaux that Robert first experience balloon flight as a passenger -
   an experience that would have a massive influence on his life. On his
   return to Paris Robert discovered that two of his former assistants had
   continued the performances without him. He refined his show, making it
   more elaborate and inventive and started performing in a more permanent
   location from [75]3 January [76]1799.^[77][1] The Gothic surroundings
   of the crumbling Convent des Capucines near the [78]Place Vendme gave
   Robert the ideal eerie home for his show.^[79][5]

   The shows began with the audience being shown [80]optical illusions and
   [81]trompe-l'il effects on their way to the showroom. Inside the
   candlelit room the audience would be seated as audio effects emulate
   the sound of wind and thunder and an unseen [82]glass harmonica plays
   unsettling music. Robert would then enter the room and start a
   monologue about death and the afterlife. He then began the show in
   earnest, creating smoky mix of [83]sulphuric acid and [84]aqua fortis
   before projecting his [85]ghostly apparitions.^[86][3]^[87][4]

   The shows were performed at the Convent des Capucines for four
   years,^[88][1] and Robert went on to take the show around the world,
   visiting Russia, Spain, and the United States among others.^[89][5]
   During his travels he dedicated a lot of his time to
   ballooning.^[90][1]

[[91]edit] Balloon flight

   Robert was a keen balloonist who designed and flew balloons in
   different countries around the world. On [92]18 July [93]1803 in
   Hamburg he set an altitude record in a [94]montgolfire.^[95][1] He
   spent many flights investigating [96]meteorological activity.^[97][6]

   Robert's two hydrogen-balloon flights in Hamburg and a third in St.
   Petersburg were claimed to be "scientific" by himself. In fact, he did
   numerous observations: Observations of barometer and thermometer, on
   shapes and altitudes of cloud formations, the behaviour of parachutes
   at different altitudes, the evaporation of [98]Ether, the electrical
   properties of different materials and the air, behavior of a magnetic
   needle, the boiling point of Water at great altitudes, sound
   propagation, influence of the high altitudes on animals ([99]Pigeons
   and [100]Butterflies), strength of solar radiation, the solar spectrum,
   gravity properties, chemical composition of the air and pressure of the
   air.

   Nevertheless, close examination of the results shows, that many of them
   contradict with laws of physics, which were already known at the time
   of the flights. Prof. L.W. Gilbert discussed the results published by
   Robert in his [101]Annalen der Physik^[102][7]. and showed, why Robert
   was wrong. For example Robert claimed, that a [103]spring scale with
   attached weights showed a lower weight at altitude as compared to the
   ground. Such an effect is existing, but only becomes apparent at
   altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet.

   In 1806 an audience of 50,000, including the royal family, gathered at
   [104]Rosenborg Castle in [105]Copenhagen to see Robert and his balloon.
   Robert flew all the way to [106]Roskilde - a remarkable feat for the
   time. The event made a lasting impression on [107]Hans Christian rsted,
   an influential Danish physicist who went on to write a series of poems
   about the flight.^[108][6]

[[109]edit] Other details

   Robert officially opened the third [110]Jardin de Tivoli, Paris on
   [111]14 May [112]1826. He died in Paris in 1837 and is buried at
   [113]Pre Lachaise Cemetery.^[114][8]
