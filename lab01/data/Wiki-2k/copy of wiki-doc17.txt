Distributed database

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Distributed data base)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   A distributed database is a [9]database that is under the control of a
   central [10]database management system (DBMS) in which [11]storage
   devices are not all attached to a common [12]CPU. It may be stored in
   multiple computers located in the same physical location, or may be
   dispersed over a [13]network of interconnected computers.

   Collections of data (eg. in a database) can be distributed across
   multiple physical locations. A distributed database is distributed into
   separate [14]partitions/fragments. Each partition/fragment of a
   distributed database may be replicated (ie. [15]redundant fail-overs,
   [16]RAID like).

   Besides distributed database replication and fragmentation, there are
   many other distributed database design technologies. For example, local
   autonomy, synchronous and asynchronous distributed database
   technologies. These technologies' implementation can and does depend on
   the needs of the business and the sensitivity/confidentiality of the
   data to be stored in the database, and hence the price the business is
   willing to spend on ensuring data security, consistency and integrity.

[[24]edit] Basic architecture

   A database Users access the distributed database through:

   Local applications
          applications which do not require data from other sites.

   Global applications
          applications which do require data from other sites.

   a distributed database does not share main memory or disks.

[[25]edit] Important considerations

   Care with a distributed database must be taken to ensure the following:
     * The distribution is transparent users must be able to interact with
       the system as if it were one [26]logical system. This applies to
       the system's performance, and methods of access among other things.
     * Transactions are transparent each transaction must maintain
       database integrity across multiple databases. Transactions must
       also be divided into subtransactions, each subtransaction affecting
       one database system...

[[27]edit] Advantages of distributed databases

     * Reflects organizational structure database fragments are located in
       the departments they relate to.
     * Local autonomy a department can control the data about them (as
       they are the ones familiar with it.)
     * Improved availability a fault in one database system will only
       affect one fragment, instead of the entire database.
     * Improved performance data is located near the site of greatest
       demand, and the database systems themselves are parallelized,
       allowing load on the databases to be balanced among servers. (A
       high load on one module of the database won't affect other modules
       of the database in a distributed database.)
     * Economics it costs less to create a network of smaller computers
       with the power of a single large computer.
     * Modularity systems can be modified, added and removed from the
       distributed database without affecting other modules (systems).

[[28]edit] Disadvantages of distributed databases

     * Complexity extra work must be done by the [29]DBAs to ensure that
       the distributed nature of the system is transparent. Extra work
       must also be done to maintain multiple disparate systems, instead
       of one big one. Extra database design work must also be done to
       account for the disconnected nature of the database for example,
       joins become prohibitively expensive when performed across multiple
       systems.
     * Economics increased complexity and a more extensive infrastructure
       means extra labour costs.
     * Security remote database fragments must be secured, and they are
       not centralized so the remote sites must be secured as well. The
       infrastructure must also be secured (e.g., by encrypting the
       network links between remote sites).
     * Difficult to maintain integrity in a distributed database,
       enforcing integrity over a network may require too much of the
       network's resources to be feasible.
     * Inexperience distributed databases are difficult to work with, and
       as a young field there is not much readily available experience on
       proper practice.
     * Lack of standards there are no tools or methodologies yet to help
       users convert a centralized DBMS into a distributed DBMS.
     * Database design more complex besides of the normal difficulties,
       the design of a distributed database has to consider fragmentation
       of data, allocation of fragments to specific sites and data
       replication.
