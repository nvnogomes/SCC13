   He is one of approximately [34]two dozen Uyghur captives accused of
   membership in the [35]Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement.^[36][7]

   Documents released in response to the writ of habeas corpus [37]Hassan
   Anvar v. George W. Bush contained a December 30, 2004 memo which
   provided one-paragraph biographies of 22 Uyghur captives, and asserted
   they were all caught at an "ETIM training camp".^[38][2]

   The brief biography of Nag Mohammed stated:

          Nag Mohammed is a 26-year-old Chinese citizen who is an ethnic
          Uighur from the Xinjiang province of China. Mohammed was last
          interviewed in mid 2003. He had disciplinary action on 27 May
          2003 for spitting, throwing water and body fluids on a guard.
          Mohammed has had no discipline during this calendar year.
          Mohammed has been suspected as being a probable member of the
          East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM). He is suspected of
          having received training in an ETIM training camp in
          Afghanistan.

[[49]edit] Combatant Status Review

   CSRT notice read to a Guantanamo captive.

   Initially the Bush administration asserted they could withhold the
   protections of the [50]Geneva Conventions from captives in the [51]War
   on Terror, while critics argued the Conventions obligated the United
   States to conduct [52]competent tribunals to determine the status of
   prisoners. Subsequently the Department of Defense instituted
   [53]Combatant Status Review Tribunals, to determine whether the
   captives met the new definition of an "[54]enemy combatant".
   The trailer where CSRTs were convened.

   From July 2004 through March 2005, a CSRT was convened to make a
   determination whether each captive had been correctly classified as an
   "enemy combatant". Nag Mohammed was among the one-third of prisoners
   for whom there was no indication they chose to participate in their
   tribunals.^[55][8]

   A [56]Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal, listing
   the alleged facts that led to his detainment. His memo accused him of
   the following:^[57][9]^[58][3]

          a. The detainee supported the [59]Taliban against the United
          States and its coalition partners:

         1. In late September 2000, the detainee traveled from
            [60]Turkistan, through [61]Kyrgyzstan and [62]Pakistan, to
            [63]Kabul, [64]Afghanistan for an [65]Eastern Turkestan
            Islamic Movement (ETIM) meeting.
         2. The detainee was a member of the ETIM.
         3. ETIM is listed on the [66]Secretary of State's [67]Terrorist
            Exclusion list.
         4. The detainee was closely associated with [68]Hassan Maksum,
            a.k.a. Mahsum.^[69][10]
         5. Hassan Maksum^[70][10] is the leader of the ETIM.
         6. The detainee was given instruction on an [71]AK-47 at the
            [72]Kartisi, Afghanistan [73]guesthouse.
         7. The detainee was arrested near [74]Mazar-e-Sharif [[75]sic],
            Afghanistan by [76]Northern Alliance troops in November 2001.
         8. The detainee participated in the Mazar-e-Sharif [[77]sic]
            prison uprising.

   [84]Allegations against the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, from Nag
   Mohammed, captive 102's Tribunal

   Neg Mohammed's original [85]Personal Representative, a [86]Major in the
   [87]United States Air Force, met with him twice, on [88]12 November
   [89]2004 and [90]16 November [91]2004. He had originally planned to
   attend his Tribunal. However, during the second meeting, he became
   visibly shaken when he was presented with a Recorder exhibit that
   asserted detailed ties between the ETIM and al Qaida and Osama bin
   Laden. He acknowledged that he was associated with the ETIM, but he
   adamantly denied knowing it was linked to terrorism.

   Neg Mohammed changed his mind about attending his Tribunal.

   His Personal Representative, referring to the Recorder's document tying
   the ETIM to al Qaida, wrote:

     "PR is attempting to ascertain the source of said document, which is
     a paragraph, typed in MS Word."

   His Personal Representative thought he was going to speak on behalf of
   Nag Mohammed. But, when the Tribunal convened on [92]November 22,
   [93]2004, he or she had been replaced with a new officer, who had not
   met with the captive. The notes the original Personal Representative
   had prepared included:
   *Para 3a1 -- 3a3: Detainee asked when the Eastern Turkestan Islamic
   Movement (ETIM) was identified as a terrorist organization and that he
   had no knowledge of this fact.
   *Para 3a4 -- 3a5: Detainee stated that he was not "closely associated
   with Hassan Maksum and that he had only saw him ########## on one
   occasion.
   *Para 3a6: Regarding "given instruction on an AK-47," detainee stated
   that he did not get instruction on an AK-47 and that he only saw an
   AK-47. He further stated that there is a big difference in being given
   instruction and only seeing the rifle.
   *Para 3a7 -- 3a8:

   Yes he was arrested near Mazar-e-Sharif; however detainee stated that
   he did not participate in the MES prison uprising. In fact, detainee
   was in an inside room when the chaos erupted on the outside. He asked
   if the US was claiming that he participated just because he was present
   at the prison. Detainee denied any participation in the prison
   uprising.
   *General
   COMMENTS:

   Detainee stated that he had no intentions of fighting against the US
   government or its allies, nor did he fight against or kill any
   Americans. He claimed that he did not support the Taliban against the
   US and its coalition partners (para 3a). He found the allegations
   disturbing and denied having any knowledge of ETIM being on the
   Terrorist Exclusiopn list.

   [100]Excerpt from the Terrorist Organization Guide, devoted to the
   Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM)

   Nag Mohammed's Tribunal convened on two occasions, [101]November 22,
   [102]2004 and [103]November 23, [104]2004.^[105][11]

   The [106]Unclassified Summary of basis for Tribunal Decision noted:

     "...After the Tribunal read all of the classified exhibits, the
     Tribunal requested additional information and recessed in order to
     allow the Recorder to gather that information..."

   Nag Mohammed's status was confirmed by [107]Tribunal panel
   21.^[108][11]

[[109]edit] Nag Mohammed v. George W. Bush

   A [110]writ of habeas corpus, [111]Nag Mohammed v. George W. Bush, was
   submitted on Nag Mohammed's behalf.^[112][11] In response, on [113]19
   September [114]2005 the Department of Defense released 30 pages of
   unclassified documents related to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

[[115]edit] Administrative Review Board

   Hearing room for annual ARB reviews^[116][12]

   Captives whose [117]CSRT labelled them "enemy combatants" were
   scheduled for annual [118]Administrative Review Board hearings. These
   hearings were designed to judge whether the captive still posed a
   threat if repatriated to their home country.

   In September 2007 the Department of Defense released all the
   [119]Summary of Evidence memos prepared for the Administrative Review
   Boards convened in 2005 or 2006.^[120][13]^[121][14] There was no
   record that an ARB had been convened to review his detention.

[[122]edit] Determined not to be an enemy combatant after all

   The [123]Department of Justice announced on 30 September 2008 that Nag
   Mohammed, and the sixteen other Uyghurs who remained in Guantanamo,
   would no longer be treated as enemy combatants.^[124][15]

[[125]edit] Military Commissions Act

   The [126]Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo
   captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system,
   so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed.^[127][16]

[[128]edit] Boumediene v. Bush

   On [129]June 12, [130]2008 the [131]United States Supreme Court ruled,
   in [132]Boumediene v. Bush, that the [133]Military Commissions Act
   could not remove the right for [134]Guantanamo captives to access the
   US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas
   petitions were eligible to be re-instated.

[[135]edit] Denial of transfer to the USA

   [136]US District Court Judge [137]Ricardo Urbina had scheduled the
   session where the Executive Branch would file the evidence that
   justified classifying the remaining Uyghurs as "enemy combatants" for 7
   October 2008. On 30 September 2008 [138]Gregory G. Katsas, the United
   States' [139]Assistant Attorney General "notice of status" stated that
   the seventeen remaining Uyghur captives would no longer be treated as
   enemy combatants.

   Lawyers for the Uyghurs pointed out that some of the Uyghurs remained
   in solitary confinement in [140]Camp 6. And the Department of Defense
   agreed that since the men were no longer to be treated as enemy
   combatants they would all be transferred to [141]Camp Iguana.

   On 7 October 2008, when the Department of Justice did not file the
   evidence justifying classifying the Uyghurs as enemy combatants, he
   issued an order requiring the Department of Defense to bring the
   Uyghurs to his court on 10 October 2008.

   On 8 October 2008 the Department of Justice filed an Emergency Motion.
   A three judge panel of Judges in the Washington Court of Appeals
   granted the Executive Branch a brief respite from complying with Judge
   Urbina's order. The panel schedule its hearing of the Executive
   Branch's justification for 20 October 2008.

   On 16 October 2008 the Department of Justice filed its justification
   for restriction
