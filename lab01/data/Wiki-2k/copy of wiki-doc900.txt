[[46]edit] Early life and family

   Towns was born in [47]Chadbourn, North Carolina and earned his
   bachelor's degree from [48]North Carolina A&T State University and a
   master's degree in social work from [49]Adelphi University.

   Towns' varied professional background includes work as an administrator
   at [50]Beth Israel Medical Center, a professor at New York's [51]Medgar
   Evers College and [52]Fordham University and a public school teacher,
   teaching orientation and mobility to [53]blind students. He is also a
   veteran of the [54]United States Army and an ordained [55]Baptist
   [56]minister.

   Towns is married to the former Gwendolyn Forbes and they reside in the
   Cypress Hills section of [57]Brooklyn. They have two children,
   [58]Darryl Towns (who serves in the [59]New York State Assembly) and
   Deidra, five grandchildren; and serve as surrogate parents to his
   nephews Jason and Jereme.

[[60]edit] House of Representatives

   In the House, Rep. Towns is Chairman of the [61]Oversight and
   Government Reform Committee. He also serves on the [62]Energy and
   Commerce Committee and is a member of the [63]Congressional Black
   Caucus. On January 7, 2009, Towns legislation to require information on
   Presidential donors kicked off the new session of the 111th
   Congress.[64][1]

   Rep. Towns' past accomplishments include, co-sponsoring or enacting
   several pieces of federal legislation, including the "Student Right To
   Know Act," which mandated the reporting of the rate of graduation among
   student athletes, creating the Telecommunications Development Fund,
   which provides capital for minority business initiatives, and the
   development of a federal program for poison control centers. [65][2]

   He has put particular emphasis on arguing in behalf of underserved
   Brooklyn communities, and has won recognition from several
   organizations for his efforts. The National Audubon Society has honored
   him for his efforts in fighting to secure federal funds for the
   restoration of Prospect Park, and Towns fought to have EPA testing in
   the aftermath of the September 11th attacks include neighborhoods
   outside of the borough of [66]Manhattan.

   In the past, Towns has been targeted by various Democratic Party
   constituencies, including factions led by his political rival [67]Al
   Sharpton, and national and local labor unions, who resent his support
   for passage of the [68]Central American Free Trade Agreement, which
   passed the House of Representatives by a razor-thin margin. In
   addition, he has been heavily criticized for taking money from telecom
   PACs and opposing [69]net neutrality.

   Gwen Towns

   In 2006, Towns faced Democratic primary challenges from [71]Charles
   Barron-a controversial member of the New York City Council and staunch
   Sharpton ally-and Roger Green, a former member of the New York State
   Assembly, who has been convicted of stealing $3,000 in taxpayer
   dollars. ^[72][1] He would go on to defeat both candidates by a
   plurality margin in the Democratic primary. As in past elections, Towns
   easily defeated his Republican and Conservative party opponents in the
   2006 general election, receiving 92% of the vote.

   [73]Kevin Powell, a [74]hip hop activist, writer, and former cast
   member on the [75]MTV [76]Reality TV show [77]The Real World, who opted
   out of challenging Towns for the 2006 Democratic nomination^[78][2]
   challenged him in 2008 instead. Towns was criticized by Powell mainly
   for supporting [79]Hillary Clinton over [80]Barack Obama in the
   Democratic presidential primaries, with some constituents saying that
   "he is out of touch". Towns defeated Powell handily in the September 9
   primary election.^[81][3]

[[83]edit] Criticism by India

   He was severely criticized by [84]India for requesting the [85]White
   House "declare India a terrorist state" because of "the pattern of
   Indian terrorism against its minorities." Towns also published a "list
   of attacks on Christians" trying to bolster his views. The [86]White
   House dismissed the allegation saying there is absolutely "no credible
   evidence" of any government involvement in the massacre.[87][3]
