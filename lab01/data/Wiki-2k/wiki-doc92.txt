      Characters from the 1986 comic book limited series [14]Watchmen.
    Clockwise from top left: Ozymandias, the second Silk Spectre, Doctor
        Manhattan, the second Nite Owl, Rorschach, and the Comedian.

   Watchmen is a twelve-issue [15]comic book [16]limited series created by
   [17]Alan Moore, [18]Dave Gibbons, and [19]John Higgins, and was
   initially published by [20]DC Comics in 1986 and 1987. The series
   focuses on six main characters: The Comedian, Doctor Manhattan, Nite
   Owl, Ozymandias, Rorschach, and Silk Spectre. These characters are
   primarily based on superhero properties DC had acquired from
   [21]Charlton Comics in the early 1980s. [22]Watchmen writer Alan Moore
   created the main characters to present four or five "radically opposing
   ways" to perceive the world, and to give readers of the story the
   privilege of determining which one was most morally
   comprehensible.^[23][1]

[[34]edit] Main characters

[[35]edit] The Comedian

   The Comedian is Edward Blake, who began his vigilante career in the
   1940s as a young man. Over the years, he became a patriotic hero for
   the United States. The Comedian was based on the Charlton Comics
   character [36]Peacemaker, with elements of the [37]Marvel Comics spy
   character [38]Nick Fury added. Moore and Gibbons saw The Comedian as "a
   kind of [39]Gordon Liddy character, only a much bigger, tougher
   guy".^[40][2]

   Already deceased when the story begins, his murder is what sets the
   plot in motion. The character appears throughout the story in
   flashbacks and aspects of his personality are revealed by other
   characters.^[41][3] Richard Reynolds described The Comedian as
   "ruthless, cynical, and nihilistic, and yet capable of deeper insights
   than the others into the role of the costumed hero".^[42][3] He and Dr.
   Manhattan are the only two government-sanctioned superheroes after the
   Keene Act banning superheroes is passed. Although he attempted to rape
   the first Silk Spectre in the 1940s, issue nine reveals that years
   later he fathered her daughter Laurie.

[[43]edit] Doctor Manhattan

   Scientist Jon Osterman was transformed into a blue-skinned superpowered
   being after he was caught in an "Intrinsic Field subtractor" in 1959.
   Afterwards, he became a superhero contracted by the United States
   government, who gave him the name Doctor Manhattan. He is the only
   character in the story who possesses obvious superpowers.^[44][4] As a
   result, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a
   strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which has increased tensions
   between the two nations at the start of the series.^[45][3]

   Doctor Manhattan was based upon Charlton's [46]Captain Atom, who in
   Moore's original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear
   threat. However, the writer found he could do more with Manhattan as a
   "kind of a quantum super-hero" than he could have with Captain
   Atom.^[47][2] In opposition to other superheroes that lacked scientific
   exploration of their origins, Moore sought to delve into [48]nuclear
   physics and [49]quantum physics in constructing the character of Dr.
   Manhattan. The writer believed that a character living in a quantum
   universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective, which would
   influence the character's perception of human affairs. Moore also
   wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like [50]Spock from
   [51]Star Trek, so he sought for Dr. Manhattan to retain "human habits"
   and to grow away from them and humanity in general.^[52][1] Gibbons had
   created the blue character [53]Rogue Trooper, and explained he reused
   the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it resembles skin tonally,
   but has a different hue. Moore incorporated the color into the story,
   and Gibbons noted the rest of the comic's color scheme made Manhattan
   more unique.^[54][5] Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would
   allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude, which
   partially influenced how they portrayed the character.^[55][6] Gibbons
   wanted to be tasteful in depicting Manhattan's nudity, selecting
   carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him
   "understated" genitals like a classical sculpture so the reader would
   not initially notice it.^[56][7]

[[57]edit] Nite Owl (Dan Dreiberg)

   Dan Dreiberg has an interest in [58]ornithology. He becomes the second
   Nite Owl and talks often with the first one, Hollis Mason. He is
   friends with Rorschach and partnered with him in order to take down
   Underboss in the early 1960s. Dan is forced into retirement by the
   government. At the beginning of Watchmen, he initially doesn't believe
   in Rorschach's "mask killer" theory. After the Comedian is murdered,
   Manhattan exiled, Rorschach arrested, and Ozymandias (Adrian Veidt)
   [59]shot at, he takes this theory seriously and rescues Rorschach from
   prison. He and Rorschach then break into Ozymandias' office, where Dan
   correctly guesses the password and finds that Veidt was behind the
   pyramid deliveries company that ordered his assassination attempt.

   He and Rorschach fly to Antarctica in his Owl Ship. There, he finds out
   that Veidt planned to create a fake alien threat to stop nuclear war
   between the United States and the USSR. He, Manhattan, and Silk Spectre
   agree to keep quiet about the true nature of the alien. He later
   marries Laurie Juspeczyk and takes on a new identity at the end of the
   novel.

   The character of Nite Owl (Dan Dreiberg) is inspired primarily by the
   [60]Blue Beetle, and also displays similarities to [61]Batman. Zack
   Snyder described Dan as someone who, as Nite Owl, is complete, and is
   lost in retirement until he finds purpose.

[[62]edit] Ozymandias

   Adrian Veidt was formerly the superhero Ozymandias, drawing inspiration
   from his hero [63]Alexander the Great. At the start of Watchmen he has
   retired to devote his attention to the running of his own enterprises.
   Ozymandias was directly based on [64]Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt, whom
   Moore had admired for using his full brain capacity as well as
   possessing full physical and mental control.^[65][2] Veidt is believed
   to be one of the smartest men on the planet, and is often accompanied
   by his genetically-engineered pet Bubastis. Richard Reynolds noted that
   by taking initiative to "help the world", Veidt displays a trait
   normally attributed to villains in superhero stories, and in a sense he
   is the "villain" of the series.^[66][8] Gibbons noted "One of the worst
   of his sins [is] kind of looking down on the rest of humanity, scorning
   the rest of humanity."^[67][9] He was recently placed at #10 on the
   [68]Forbes Fictional 15.^[69][10]

[[70]edit] Rorschach

          Main article: [71]Rorschach (comics)

   At the beginning of the novel, Rorschach is the only illegal vigilante
   still active. He discovers that homicide victim Edward Blake was the
   government-sponsored vigilante the Comedian, and he believes that
   someone is killing costumed heroes. In the course of the novel Doctor
   Manhattan exiles himself to Mars, someone attempts to assassinate
   Ozymandias (Adrian Veidt), and Rorschach is arrested by the police.
   Rorschach's friend Nite Owl springs him from jail and they head to
   Veidt's base in Antarctica, where they find that Veidt planned to unite
   the world by creating a fake alien threat. The other vigilantes present
   agree to keep silent, but Rorschach refuses to compromise and is
   vaporized by Doctor Manhattan.

   The character of Rorschach is primarily inspired by [72]The Question
   and [73]Mr. A, both characters created by [74]Steve Ditko.

[[75]edit] Silk Spectre (Laurie Juspeczyk)

   Laurie Juspeczyk, the second Silk Spectre, is the daughter of the
   Comedian and Sally Jupiter, the first Silk Spectre. Laurie's mother
   apparently wanted her to follow in her footsteps and so she fought
   crime for ten years before the Keene Act banned vigilantes. Unlike the
   other protagonists, Silk Spectre was not based on a particular Charlton
   character. Moore felt he needed a female hero in the cast and drew
   inspiration from comic book heroines such as [76]Black Canary and
   [77]Phantom Lady.^[78][2]

   Laurie is kept on retainer by the government because of her
   relationship with Doctor Manhattan and lives on a government base at
   the beginning of the comic. When Doctor Manhattan leaves Earth, the
   government kicks her off the base and suspends her expense account so
   she moves in with Nite Owl and her and Dan start a romantic
   relationship. At the end of the eighth issue, Doctor Manhattan appears
   and takes her to Mars to convince him to save the world. On Mars, she
   realizes that the Comedian was her father. After the final encounter
   with Veidt at the end of the series, she assumes the identity of Mrs.
   Hollis.

       [86]Lieutenant and one of the more active proponents of the
       Minutemen, a group of superheroes formed in the 1940s; he suggested
       that a collaboration of forces would be the most effective way to
       fight crime. He is briefly mentioned as having been decapitated in
       a car accident in 1974. Involved in a relationship with Hooded
       Justice.
     * Hooded Justice: the first masked vigilante, who disappeared under
       mysterious circumstances. His real identity is never revealed but
       is suggested to be a circus strongman named Rolf Muller. Involved
       in a relationship with Captain Metropolis.
     * Moloch the Mystic (real name Edgar William Jacobi): a former
       supervillain who was jailed for a time. He is dying of cancer.
