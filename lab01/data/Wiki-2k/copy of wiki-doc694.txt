[[73]edit] Family and early life

   Grey was the eldest of the seven children of Colonel George Henry Grey
   and Harriet Jane Pearson, daughter of Charles Pearson. His grandfather
   [74]Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet, of Fallodon, was also a prominent
   Liberal politician, while his great-grandfather [75]Sir George Grey,
   1st Baronet, of [76]Fallodon, was the second son of [77]Charles Grey,
   1st Earl Grey, and the younger brother of Prime Minister [78]Charles
   Grey, 2nd Earl Grey.

   Grey attended [79]Temple Grove school from 1873 until 1876. Whilst at
   the school Grey's father died unexpectedly in December 1874 and his
   grandfather assumed responsibility for his education sending him to
   [80]Winchester College in 1876 where his head of house was [81]William
   Palmer who had been at Temple Grove. Grey would later have official
   relations with Palmer when, as Lord Selborne, he served as [82]High
   Commissioner in South Africa.

   Grey went up to [83]Balliol College, Oxford in 1880 to read [84]Greats.
   Apparently an indolent student he was tutored by [85]Mandell Creighton
   during the vacations and managed a second in [86]Mods. Grey
   subsequently became even more idle using his time to become university
   champion at [87]real tennis. In 1882 his grandfather died and he became
   Sir Edward Grey inheriting an estate of about 2,000 acres (8.1 km^2)
   and a private income.

   Returning to [88]Oxford in the autumn of 1883, Grey switched to
   studying [89]jurisprudence in the belief that it would be an easier
   option but by January 1884 he had been [90]sent down but allowed to
   return to sit his [91]finals. Grey returned in the summer and achieved
   a [92]third.

   Grey left university with no clear career plan and in the summer of
   1884 he asked a neighbour [93]Lord Northbrook at the time [94]First
   Lord of the Admiralty to find him serious and unpaid employment.
   Northbrook recommended him as a private secretary to his kinsman
   [95]Sir Evelyn Baring the [96]British consul general to Egypt who was
   attending a conference in London.

   Grey had shown no particular interest in politics whilst at university
   but by the summer of 1884 Northbrook found him very keen on politics
   and after the Egyptian conference had ended found him a position as an
   unpaid assistant private secretary to [97]Hugh Childers the
   [98]Chancellor of the Exchequer.

   Grey was selected as the [99]Liberal Party candidate for
   [100]Berwick-upon-Tweed where his [101]Conservative opponent was the
   sitting member [102]Earl Percy. Grey interrupted his campaign in
   October 1885 to marry Dorothy Widdrington whom he had met the previous
   winter.

[[103]edit] Early political career

   At 23, Grey was returned as [104]the youngest MP in the new House.

[[105]edit] Junior office (August 1892-June 1895)

   Grey retained his seat in the [106]1892 election with a majority of
   only 442 votes and to his surprise was made Parliamentary
   [107]Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by [108]Gladstone
   (albeit after his son [109]Herbert had refused the post) under
   [110]Lord Rosebery. Grey would lated claim that at this point he had
   had no special training, nor paid special attention to foreign
   affairs.^[111][1]

   Grey would later date his first suspicions of future Anglo-German
   disagreements to his early days in office after Germany sought
   commercial concessions from Britain in the [112]Ottoman Empire in
   return for support for the British position in Egypt. It was the abrupt
   and rough peremtoriness of the German action that gave me an unpleasant
   impression not, he added, that the German position was at all
   unreasonable, rather that the method... was not that of a
   friend.^[113][2] With hindsight, he argued in his memoirs, the whole
   policy of the years from 1886 to 1904 [might] be criticized as having
   played into the hands of Germany.^[114][3]

[[115]edit] 1895 statement on French expansion in Africa

   Prior to the Foreign Office vote on 28 March 1895 Grey asked [116]Lord
   Kimberley (he had replaced Rosebery as Foreign Secretary when he became
   Prime Minister in 1895) for direction as to how he should answer any
   question about French activities in West Africa. According to Grey,
   Kimberley suggested pretty firm language^[117][4]. In fact West Africa
   was not mentioned but when pressed on possible French activities in the
   Nile Valley Grey stated that a French expedition would be an unfriendly
   act and would be so viewed by England^[118][5] According to Grey the
   subsequent row both in Paris and in Cabinet was made worse by the
   failure of [119]Hansard to record that his statement referred
   explicitly to the Nile Valley and not to Africa in general.^[120][6]
   The statement was made before the dispatch of the [121]Marchand
   expedition (indeed he believed it might have actually provoked it) and
   as Grey admits did much to damage future Anglo-French
   relations.^[122][7]

   The Liberal Party lost a key vote in the House of Commons on [123]21
   June [124]1895 and Grey was amongst the majority in his party that
   preferred a dissolution to continuing. He seems to have left office
   with few regrets noting I shall never be in office again and the days
   of my stay in the House of Commons are probably numbered. We [he and
   his wife] are both very glad and relieved....^[125][8] The Liberals
   were heavily defeated in the subsequent [126]General Election although
   Grey added 300 votes to his own majority.^[127][9]

[[128]edit] Foreign Secretary

   Grey was appointed [129]Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, taking
   office on [130]10 December [131]1905, and was then easily returned in
   the [132]1906 election. He was to hold office for 11 years to the day,
   the longest continuous tenure in this office.

[[133]edit] Anglo-Russian Entente 1907

          See also: [134]Anglo-Russian Entente

   As early as 13 December 1905 Grey had assured the Russian Ambassador
   [135]Count Alexander Benckendorff that he supported the idea of an
   agreement with Russia.^[136][10] Negotiations began soon after the
   arrival of [137]Sir Arthur Nicolson the new [138]British Ambassador in
   June 1906. In contrast with the previous [139]Conservative government
   that had seen Russia as a potential threat to the [140]empire, Grey's
   intention was to re-establish Russia as a factor in European
   politics^[141][11] on the side of France and Great Britain in order to
   maintain a [142]balance of power in Europe^[143][12]

[[144]edit] Bosnian Crisis 1908

          See also: [145]Bosnian crisis

[[146]edit] Agadir Crisis 1911

   Grey did not welcome the prospect of a renewed [147]crisis over
   Morocco: he worried that it might either lead to a re-opening of the
   issues covered by the [148]Treaty of Algeciras or that it might drive
   [149]Spain into alliance with [150]Germany. Initially Grey tried to
   restrain both France and Spain but by the Spring of 1911 he had failed
   on both counts. Grey believed that whether he liked it or not his hands
   were tied by the terms of the [151]Entente cordiale.

   The despatch of the German gunboat [152]Panther to [153]Agadir served
   to strengthen French resolve and, because he was determined to both
   protect the agreement with France and also to block German attempts at
   expansion around the [154]Mediterranean, it pushed Grey closer to
   France. Grey however tried to calm the situation merely commenting on
   the abrupt nature of the German intervention and insisting that Britain
   must participate in any discussions about the future of Morocco.

   In [155]cabinet on 4 July Grey accepted that the UK would oppose any
   German port in the region, any new fortified port anywhere on the
   Moroccan coast and that Britain must continue to enjoy an 'open-door'
   for its trade with Morocco. Grey at this point was resisting efforts by
   the [156]Foreign Office to support French intransigence. By the time a
   second cabinet was held on 21 July Grey had adopted a tougher position
   suggesting that he propose to Germany that a multi-national conference
   be held and that were Germany to refuse to participate we should take
   steps to assert and protect British interests.^[157][13]

[[158]edit] July Crisis

   Although his activist foreign policy, which relied increasingly on the
   Entente with France and Russia, came under criticism from the radicals
   within his own party, he maintained his position because of the support
   of the [159]Conservatives for his "non-partisan" foreign policy.

   In 1914, Grey played a key role in the [160]July Crisis leading to the
   outbreak of [161]World War I. His attempts to mediate the dispute
   between [162]Austria-Hungary and [163]Serbia by a "Stop in
   [164]Belgrade" came to nothing, owing to the tepid German response. He
   also failed to clearly communicate to Germany that a breach of the
   treaty not merely to respect but to protect the neutrality of Belgium
   of which both Britain and Germany were signatories would cause Britain
   to declare war against Germany. When he finally did make such
   communication German forces were already massed at the Belgian border
   and [165]Helmuth von Moltke convinced [166]Kaiser Wilhelm II it was too
   late to change the plan of attack. Thus when [167]Germany declared war
   on [168]France (3 August) and broke the treaty by invading [169]Belgium
   (4 August), the British Cabinet voted almost unanimously to declare war
   on [170]August 4, [171]1914.

[[172]edit] World War I

   Following the declaration of [173]World War I Grey found that British
   foreign policy was constrained by mainly military events that were
   outside his control.

[[174]edit] Italian entry into the war 1915

          See also: [175]Italy in World War I

[[176]edit] Relations with the USA

   During the war Grey, along with the Marquess of Crewe was also
   instrumental in forcing an initially reluctant ambassador Cecil-Spring
   Rice to raise the issue of the [177]Hindu-German Conspiracy to the
   American Government that ultimately led to the unfolding of the entire
   plot.

[[178]edit] Asiatic Turkey

   In the early years of the war, Grey negotiated several important secret
   treaties, promising [179]Russia the [180]Turkish [181]Straits.
   Lord Grey.

   He maintained his position as Foreign Secretary when the Conservatives
   came into the government to form a coalition in May 1915, but when the
   Asquith Coalition collapsed in December of the following year and
   [182]David Lloyd George became Prime Minister, Grey went into
   opposition.

   In an attempt to reduce his workload he left the [183]House of Commons
   for the [184]House of Lords in July 1916. becoming Viscount Grey of
   Fallodon', a title which would become extinct with his death.

[[185]edit] Ambassador to the USA

[[186]edit] Liberal Leader in the House of Lords

   Grey continued to be active in politics despite his near blindness,
   serving as Liberal Leader in the Lords from 1923 until his resignation
   on the grounds that he was unable to attend on a regular basis shortly
   before the [187]1924 election. He was a member of the [188]Coefficients
   dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [189]Fabian
   campaigners [190]Sidney and [191]Beatrice Webb.

[[192]edit] Private life

[[193]edit] Sporting achievements

   Grey represented his College at [194]football and was also an excellent
   [195]tennis player being [196]Oxford champion in 1883 (and winning the
   varsity competition the same year) and won the [197]British
   championship in 1889, 1891, 1895, 1896 and 1898. He was runner-up in
   1892, 1893 and 1894 years in which he held office.^[198][14]

   Grey was a life-long [199]fisherman publishing a book on his exploits
   in 1899.^[200][15]

   Grey was an avid [201]ornithologist one of the best known photographs
   of him shows him with a Robin perched on his hat.

[[202]edit] Assessment

   He is probably best remembered for a remark he supposedly made to a
   friend one evening just before the outbreak of the First World War, as
   he watched the lights being lit on the street below his office: "The
   lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in
   our lifetime."^[203][16]
