   The durian (pronounced [20]/drin/)^[21][1] is the [22]fruit of trees
   from the [23]genus Durio belonging to the [24]Malvaceae
   [25]family^[26][2]^[27][3] (some taxonomists place Durio in a distinct
   family Durionaceae). Widely known and revered in [28]Southeast Asia as
   the "King of Fruits", the fruit is distinctive for its large size,
   unique [29]odour, and formidable [30]thorn-covered [31]husk. The fruit
   can grow up to 30 centimetres (12 in) long and 15 centimetres (6 in) in
   diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7 lb). Its
   shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to
   brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species.

   The edible flesh emits a distinctive odour, strong and penetrating even
   when the husk is intact. Regarded by some as fragrant, others as
   overpowering and offensive, the smell evokes reactions from deep
   appreciation to intense disgust. The odour has led to the fruit's
   banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in Southeast
   Asia.

   The durian, native to [32]Brunei, [33]Indonesia and [34]Malaysia, has
   been known to the Western world for about 600 years. The British
   [35]naturalist [36]Alfred Russel Wallace famously described its flesh
   as "a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds" in the 19th century.
   The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and is used to
   flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet edibles in Southeast Asian
   cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked. The name durian
   comes from the [37]Malay word duri (thorn) with [38]suffix -an.

   There are 30 recognised Durio species, at least nine of which produce
   edible fruit. Durio zibethinus is the only species available in the
   international market: other species are sold in their local regions.
   There are hundreds of durian [39]cultivars; most of them have a common
   name and a code number starting with "D". Many consumers express
   preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the
   market.

[[53]edit] Species

   For the complete list of known species of Durio, see [54]List of Durio
   species.
   Durian tree, compared to human height

   Durian [55]trees are relatively large, growing to 2550 metres
   (80165 ft) in height depending on the species.^[56][4] The leaves are
   [57]evergreen, elliptic to oblong and 1018 centimetres (47 in) long.
   The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large
   branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx
   ([58]sepals) and five (rarely four or six) [59]petals. Durian trees
   have one or two flowering and fruiting periods per year, though the
   timing varies depending on the species, cultivars, and localities. A
   typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian
   fruit can hang from any branch and matures roughly three months after
   [60]pollination. The fruit can grow up to 30 centimetres (12 in) long
   and 15 centimetres (6 in) in diameter, and typically weighs one to
   three kilograms (2 to 7 lb).^[61][4] Its shape ranges from oblong to
   round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow
   to red, depending on the species.^[62][4] Among the thirty known
   species of Durio, nine of them have been identified as producing edible
   fruits: D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. grandiflorus, D. graveolens,
   [63]D. kutejensis, D. lowianus, D. macrantha, D. oxleyanus and D.
   testudinarum.^[64][5] However, there are many species for which the
   fruit has never been collected or properly examined, so other species
   with edible fruit may exist.^[65][4]
   Durian flowers are usually closed during the daytime.

   The name durian comes from the [66]Malay word duri (thorn) together
   with the [67]suffix -an (for building a noun in Malay).^[68][6]^[69][7]
   D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated on a large
   scale and available outside of its native region. Since this species is
   open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and
   odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree [70]phenology. In the species
   name, zibethinus refers to the Indian [71]civet, [72]Viverra zibetha.
   There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by
   [73]Linnaeus, refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the
   fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like
   the civet.^[74][8]

   Durian flowers are large and feathery with copious [75]nectar, and give
   off a heavy, sour and buttery odour. These features are typical of
   flowers pollinated by certain species of [76]bats that eat nectar and
   [77]pollen.^[78][9] According to research conducted in Malaysia in the
   1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats
   ([79]Eonycteris spelaea).^[80][4] However, a 1996 study indicated two
   species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by
   [81]spiderhunters ([82]Nectariniidae) and another species, D.
   kutejensis, was pollinated by [83]giant honey bees and birds as well as
   bats.^[84][10]

[[85]edit] Cultivars

   Different cultivars of durian often have distinct colours. D101 (right)
   has rich yellow flesh, clearly distinguishable from an unrelated
   variety (left).

   Over the centuries, numerous durian [86]cultivars propagated by
   vegetative [87]clones have arisen in southeast Asia. They used to be
   grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality
   fruit, but are now propagated by [88]layering, [89]marcotting, or more
   commonly, by [90]grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or
   U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected [91]rootstocks.
   Different cultivars can be distinguished to some extent by variations
   in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines.^[92][4] Durian
   consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch
   higher prices in the market.^[93][11]

   Most cultivars have a common name and a code number starting with "D".
   For example, some popular clones are Kop (D99 [94]Thai: , [95]kp),
   Chanee (D123, [96]Thai: , [97]ni), Berserah or Green Durian or Tuan Mek
   Hijau (D145 [98]Thai: , [99]trian kaw), Kan Yao (D158, [100]Thai: ,
   [101]kn jaw), Mon Thong (D159, [102]Thai: , [103]mn t), Kradum Thong
   ([104]Thai: , [105]krdum t), and with no common name, D24 and D169.
   Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars
   of D. zibethinus exist in [106]Thailand. Chanee is the most preferred
   rootstock due to its resistance to infection by [107]Phytophthora
   palmivora. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, only four are currently
   in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Kradum Thong, Mon Thong,
   and Kan Yao.^[108][4] There are more than 100 registered cultivars in
   [109]Malaysia^[110][12] and many superior cultivars have been
   identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian
   Agriculture, Horticulture and Agrotourism Show. In [111]Vietnam, the
   same process has been done through competitions held by the Southern
   Fruit Research Institute.

   In recent times, Songpol Somsri, a Thai government scientist, crossbred
   more than ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No. 1, a
   cultivar without the characteristic odour, which is awaiting final
   approval from the local Ministry of Agriculture.^[112][13] Another
   hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour about three days after the
   fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies
   consumers who prefer the pungent odour.^[113][13]

[[114]edit] Cultivation and availability

   The durian is native to [115]Indonesia, [116]Malaysia and [117]Brunei.
   There is some debate as to whether the durian is native to the
   [118]Philippines, or was introduced.^[119][4] The durian is grown in
   other areas with a similar climate; it is strictly [120]tropical and
   stops growing when mean daily temperatures drop below 22 C
   (72 F).^[121][5]

   The centre of [122]ecological diversity for durians is the island of
   [123]Borneo, where the fruit of the edible species of Durio including
   D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. graveolens, D. kutejensis, D. oxleyanus
   and D. testudinarum are sold in local markets. In Brunei, D. zibethinus
   is not grown because consumers prefer other species such as D.
   graveolens, D. kutejensis and D. oxleyanus. These species are commonly
   distributed in Brunei, and together with other species like D.
   testudinarum and D. dulcis, represent rich [124]genetic
   diversity.^[125][14]

   USA market

   Although the durian is not native to [127]Thailand, the country is
   currently one of the major exporters of durians, growing
   781,000 [128]tonnes (769,000 [129]LT; 861,000 [130]ST) of the world's
   total harvest of 1,400,000 tonnes (1,380,000 LT; 1,540,000 ST) in 1999,
   of which it exported 111,000 tonnes (109,000 LT; 122,000 ST).^[131][15]
   Malaysia and Indonesia follow, both producing about 265,000 tonnes
   (261,000 LT; 292,000 ST) each. Of this, Malaysia exported 35,000 tonnes
   (34,000 LT; 39,000 ST) in 1999.^[132][15] [133]Chantaburi in Thailand
   each year holds the World Durian Festival in early May. This single
   province is responsible for half of the durian production of
   Thailand.^[134][16]^[135][17] In the Philippines, the centre of durian
   production is the [136]Davao Region. The [137]Kadayawan Festival is an
   annual celebration featuring the durian in [138]Davao City. Other
   places where durians are grown include [139]Cambodia, [140]Laos,
   [141]Vietnam, [142]Myanmar, [143]India, [144]Sri Lanka, the [145]West
   Indies, [146]Florida, [147]Hawaii, [148]Papua New Guinea, the
   [149]Polynesian Islands, [150]Madagascar, southern China (Hainan
   Island), [151]northern Australia, and [152]Pulau Ubin island in
   [153]Singapore.

   Durian was introduced into Australia in the early 1960s and clonal
   material was first introduced in 1975. Over thirty clones of D.
   zibethinus and six Durio species have been subsequently introduced into
   Australia.^[154][18] China is the major importer, purchasing
   65,000 tonnes (64,000 LT; 72,000 ST) in 1999, followed by Singapore
   with 40,000 tonnes (39,000 LT; 44,000 ST) and Taiwan with 5,000 tonnes
   (4,900 LT; 5,500 ST). In the same year, the United States imported
   2,000 tonnes (2,000 LT; 2,200 ST), mostly frozen, and the [155]European
   Community imported 500 tonnes (490 LT; 550 ST).^[156][15]

   The durian is a seasonal fruit, unlike some other non-seasonal tropical
   fruits such as the [157]papaya which are available throughout the year.
   In Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, the season for durians is
   typically from June to August, which coincides with that of the
   [158]mangosteen.^[159][4] Prices of durians are relatively high as
   compared with other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong
   demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24, Sultan, and Mao Shan
   Wang has resulted in typical retail prices of between [160]S$8 to S$15
   ([161]US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit.^[162][11] With an
   average weight of about 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb), a durian fruit would
   therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15).^[163][11] The edible
   portion of the fruit, known as the [164]aril and usually referred to as
   the "flesh" or "pulp", only accounts for about 15-30% of the mass of
   the entire fruit.^[165][4] Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless
   quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) in a single purchase
   of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family
   members.^[166][11]

   In season durians can be found in mainstream [167]Japanese supermarkets
   while, in the West, they are sold mainly by Asian markets.

[[168]edit] Flavour and odour

   Sign forbidding durians on Singapore's [169]Mass Rapid Transit

   The unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to
   express diverse and passionate views ranging from deep appreciation to
   intense disgust. Writing in 1856, the British [170]naturalist
   [171]Alfred Russel Wallace provides a much-quoted description of the
   flavour of the durian:
   The five cells are silky-white within, and are filled with a mass of
   firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing about three seeds each. This pulp
   is the edible part, and its consistence and flavour are indescribable.
   A rich custard highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general
   idea of it, but there are occasional wafts of flavour that call to mind
   cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine, and other incongruous dishes.
   Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing
   else possesses, but which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acid nor
   sweet nor juicy; yet it wants neither of these qualities, for it is in
   itself perfect. It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and the more
   you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact, to eat
   Durians is a new sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience.
   ... as producing a food of the most exquisite flavour it is
   unsurpassed.^[172][19]

   While Wallace cautions that "the smell of the ripe fruit is certainly
   at first disagreeable", later descriptions by westerners are more
   graphic. British novelist [173]Anthony Burgess writes that eating
   durian is "like eating sweet raspberry [174]blancmange in the
   lavatory."^[175][20] Chef [176]Andrew Zimmern compares the taste to
   "completely rotten, mushy onions."^[177][21] [178]Anthony Bourdain,
   while a lover of durian, relates his encounter with the fruit as thus:
   "Its taste can only be described as...indescribable, something you will
   either love or despise. ...Your breath will smell as if you'd been
   French-kissing your dead grandmother."^[179][22] Travel and food writer
   [180]Richard Sterling says:
   ... its odor is best described as pig-shit, turpentine and onions,
   garnished with a gym sock. It can be smelled from yards away. Despite
   its great local popularity, the raw fruit is forbidden from some
   establishments such as hotels, subways and airports, including public
   transportation in Southeast Asia.^[181][23]
   [182]Hydrogen sulphide, one of the chemical compounds that may be
   responsible for the characteristic odour of durian

   Other comparisons have been made with the [183]civet, [184]sewage,
   stale vomit, [185]skunk spray and used surgical swabs.^[186][24] The
   wide range of descriptions for the odour of durian may have a great
   deal to do with the variability of durian odour itself. Durians from
   different species or clones can have significantly different aromas;
   for example, red durian (D. dulcis) has a deep [187]caramel flavour
   with a [188]turpentine odour while red-fleshed durian (D. graveolens)
   emits a fragrance of roasted [189]almonds.^[190][25] Among the
   varieties of D. zibethinus, Thai varieties are sweeter in flavour and
   less odourous than Malay ones.^[191][4] The degree of ripeness has an
   effect on the flavour as well.^[192][4] Three scientific analyses of
   the composition of durian aroma from 1972, 1980, and 1995 each found a
   mix of volatile compounds including [193]esters, [194]ketones, and
   different [195]sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be
   primarily responsible for the distinctive odour.^[196][4]

   This strong odour can be detected half a mile away by animals, thus
   luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a
   variety of animals, including [197]squirrels, [198]mouse deer,
   [199]pigs, [200]orangutan, [201]elephants, and even carnivorous
   [202]tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of
   the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit
   and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed
   being dispersed as a result.^[203][26] The thorny, armoured covering of
   the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely
   to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.^[204][27]

[[205]edit] Ripeness and selection

   A customer in Malaysia sniffs durian before purchasing it.

   According to [206]Larousse Gastronomique, the durian fruit is ready to
   eat when its husk begins to crack.^[207][28] However, the ideal stage
   of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast
   Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be
   collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars
   of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to
   ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in [208]southern Thailand
   prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within
   the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. In
   [209]northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be as soft
   and pungent in aroma as possible. In Malaysia and Singapore, most
   consumers prefer the fruit to be quite ripe and may even risk allowing
   the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open.
   In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly
   alcoholic,^[210][24] the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly
   complex.

   The various preferences regarding ripeness among consumers make it hard
   to issue general statements about choosing a "good" durian. A durian
   that falls off the tree continues to ripen for two to four days, but
   after five or six days most would consider it overripe and
   unpalatable.^[211][29] The usual advice for a durian consumer choosing
   a whole fruit in the market is to examine the quality of the [212]stem
   or stalk which loses moisture as it ages: a big, solid stem is a sign
   of freshness.^[213][30] Reportedly, unscrupulous merchants wrap, paint,
   or remove the stalks altogether. Another frequent piece of advice is to
   shake the fruit and listen for the sound of the seeds moving within,
   indicating the durian is very ripe and the pulp has dried out a
   bit.^[214][30]

[[215]edit] History

   Colquios dos Simples e Drogas da India (1563)

   The durian has been known and consumed in southeastern Asia since
   [216]prehistoric times, but has only been known to the western world
   for about 600 years. The earliest known European reference to the
   durian is the record of [217]Niccol Da Conti, who travelled to
   southeastern Asia in the 15th century.^[218][4] The [219]Portuguese
   physician [220]Garcia de Orta described durians in [221]Colquios dos
   Simples e Drogas da India published in 1563. In 1741, Herbarium
   Amboinense by the German botanist [222]Georg Eberhard Rumphius was
   published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians
   for over a century. The genus Durio has a complex [223]taxonomy that
   has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was
   created by Rumphius.^[224][5] During the early stages of its
   taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the
   [225]soursop (Annona muricata), for both of these species had thorny
   green fruit.^[226][4] It is also interesting to note the Malay name for
   the soursop is durian Belanda, meaning Dutch durian.^[227][31] In the
   18th century, [228]Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to
   belong to [229]Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse
   chestnut.
   Durio zibethinus. [230]Chromolithograph by Hoola Van Nooten, circa 1863

   D. zibethinus was introduced into [231]Ceylon by the Portuguese in the
   16th century and was reintroduced many times later. It has been planted
   in the Americas but confined to [232]botanical gardens. The first
   seedlings were sent from the [233]Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to
   [234]Auguste Saint-Arroman of [235]Dominica in 1884.^[236][32]

   In southeast Asia the durian has been cultivated for centuries at the
   village level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially
   in south-eastern Asia since the mid-20th century.^[237][4] In My Tropic
   Isle, [238]Australian author and [239]naturalist [240]Edmund James
   Banfield tells how, in the early 20th century, a friend in Singapore
   sent him a durian seed, which he planted and cared for on his tropical
   island off the north coast of [241]Queensland.^[242][33]

   In 1949, the British botanist [243]E. J. H. Corner published The Durian
   Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His theory was that
   [244]endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in
   their stomach) arose before any other method of [245]seed dispersal,
   and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest
   practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular the red durian
   exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants.

   Since the early 1990s, the domestic and international demand for durian
   in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([246]ASEAN) region has
   increased significantly, partly due to the increasing affluence in
   Asia.^[247][4]

[[248]edit] Uses

[[249]edit] Culinary

   A durian-flavoured [250]Yule log

   Durian fruit is used to flavour a wide variety of sweet edibles such as
   traditional Malay candy, [251]ice kachang, [252]dodol, rose biscuits,
   and, with a touch of modern innovation, [253]ice cream,
   [254]milkshakes, [255]mooncakes, [256]Yule logs and [257]cappuccino.
   Pulut Durian is [258]glutinous rice steamed with [259]coconut milk and
   served with ripened durian. In [260]Sabah, red durian is fried with
   onions and chilli and served as a side dish.^[261][34] Red-fleshed
   durian is traditionally added to sayur, an Indonesian soup made from
   fresh water fish.^[262][35] Ikan brengkes is fish cooked in a
   durian-based sauce, traditional in [263]Sumatra.^[264][36] Tempoyak
   refers to [265]fermented durian, usually made from lower quality durian
   that is unsuitable for direct consumption.^[266][37] Tempoyak can be
   eaten either cooked or uncooked, is normally eaten with rice, and can
   also be used for making [267]curry. Sambal Tempoyak is a [268]Sumatran
   dish made from the fermented durian fruit, coconut milk, and a
   collection of spicy ingredients known as [269]sambal.

   In Thailand, blocks of durian paste are sold in the markets, though
   much of the paste is [270]adulterated with [271]pumpkin.^[272][29]
   Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines,
   where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both
   sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with
   salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which
   are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled,
   roasted or fried in [273]coconut oil, with a texture that is similar to
   [274]taro or [275]yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin
   and cooked with sugar as a confectionery. Uncooked durian seeds are
   toxic due to [276]cyclopropene [277]fatty acids and should not be
   ingested.^[278][38] Young leaves and [279]shoots of the durian are
   occasionally cooked as [280]greens. Sometimes the ash of the burned
   [281]rind is added to special cakes.^[282][29] The petals of durian
   flowers are eaten in the [283]Batak provinces of Indonesia, while in
   the [284]Moluccas islands the husk of the durian fruit is used as fuel
   to [285]smoke fish. The nectar and pollen of the durian flower that
   honeybees collect is an important [286]honey source, but the
   characteristics of the honey are unknown.^[287][39]

   Durian fruit contains a high amount of [298]sugar,^[299][27]
   [300]vitamin C, [301]potassium, and the [302]serotonergic amino acid
   [303]tryptophan,^[304][41] and is a good source of [305]carbohydrates,
   [306]proteins, and [307]fats.^[308][35]^[309][32] It is recommended as
   a good source of raw fats by several [310]raw food
   advocates,^[311][42]^[312][43] while others classify it as a
   [313]high-glycemic or high-fat food, recommending to minimise its
   consumption.^[314][44]^[315][45]

   In Malaysia, a [316]decoction of the leaves and roots used to be
   prescribed as an [317]antipyretic. The leaf juice is applied on the
   head of a fever patient.^[318][29] The most complete description of the
   medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay
   prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930. It instructs the
   reader to boil the roots of [319]Hibiscus rosa-sinensis with the roots
   of Durio zibethinus, [320]Nephelium longan, Nephelium mutabile and
   [321]Artocarpus integrifolia, and drink the decoction or use it as a
   [322]poultice.^[323][46]

   In the 1920s, Durian Fruit Products, Inc., of New York City launched a
   product called "Dur-India" as a health food supplement, selling at
   [324]US$9 for a dozen bottles, each containing 63 tablets. The tablets
   allegedly contained durian and a species of the genus [325]Allium from
   India and [326]vitamin E. The company promoted the supplement saying
   that it provides "more concentrated healthful energy in food form than
   any other product the world affords".^[327][29]

[[328]edit] Customs and beliefs

   Southeast Asian folk beliefs, as well as [329]traditional Chinese
   medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable
   to cause [330]excessive sweating.^[331][47] The traditional method to
   counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit
   after the pulp has been consumed and drink it.^[332][24] An alternative
   method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with [333]mangosteen,
   which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or
   people with [334]high blood pressure are traditionally advised not to
   consume durian.^[335][13]^[336][48]

   Another common local belief is that the durian is harmful when eaten
   with [337]coffee^[338][24] or alcoholic beverages.^[339][4] The latter
   belief can be traced back at least to the 18th century when Rumphius
   stated that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it
   will cause indigestion and [340]bad breath. In 1929, J. D. Gimlette
   wrote in his Malay Poisons and Charm Cures that the durian fruit must
   not be eaten with [341]brandy. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his
   Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea that "a
   feeling of morbidity" often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon
   after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of
   this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions.^[342][4]

   The [343]Javanese believe durian to have [344]aphrodisiac qualities,
   and impose a set of rules on what may or may not be consumed with it or
   shortly thereafter.^[345][24] A saying in [346]Indonesian, durian jatuh
   sarung naik, meaning "the durians fall and the [347]sarongs come up",
   refers to this belief.^[348][49] The warnings against the supposed
   lecherous quality of this fruit soon spread to the Westthe
   [349]Swedenborgian philosopher [350]Herman Vetterling commented on
   so-called "erotic properties" of the durian in the early 20th
   century.^[351][50]
   Durian fruit is armed with sharp thorns, fully capable of drawing
   blood.

   A durian falling on a person's head can cause serious injuries because
   it is heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant
   height. Wearing a [352]hardhat is recommended when collecting the
   fruit. [353]Alfred Russel Wallace writes that death rarely ensues from
   it, because the copious [354]effusion of blood prevents the
   inflammation which might otherwise take place.^[355][19] A common
   saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling
   because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when
   people may be hurt.^[356][51] A saying in Indonesian, ketibaan durian
   runtuh, which translates to "getting a fallen durian", means receiving
   an unexpected luck or fortune.^[357][52] Nevertheless, signs warning
   people not to linger under durian trees are found in
   Indonesia.^[358][53]

   A naturally spineless variety of durian growing wild in [359]Davao,
   Philippines, was discovered in the 1960s; fruits borne from these seeds
   also lacked spines.^[360][4] Since the bases of the scales develop into
   spines as the fruit matures, sometimes spineless durians are produced
   artificially by scraping scales off immature fruits.^[361][4]

[[362]edit] Cultural influence

   Singapore's [363]Esplanade building, nicknamed "The Durian"

   The durian is commonly known as the "King of the Fruits",^[364][35] a
   label that can be attributed to its formidable look and overpowering
   odour.^[365][54]
   Monument to durian at the [366]Davao International Airport

   In its native southeastern Asia, however, the durian is an everyday
   food and portrayed in the local media in accordance with the different
   cultural perception it has in the region. The durian symbolised the
   subjective nature of ugliness and beauty in [367]Hong Kong director
   [368]Fruit Chan's [369]2000 film [370]Durian Durian (, Liulian piao
   piao), and was a nickname for the reckless but lovable protagonist of
   the eponymous Singaporean TV comedy Durian King played by [371]Adrian
   Pang.^[372][55] Likewise, the oddly shaped [373]Esplanade building in
   Singapore is often called "The Durian" by locals,^[374][55] and "The
   Big Durian" is the nickname of [375]Jakarta, [376]Indonesia.^[377][56]

   One of the names Thailand contributed to the list of storm names for
   Western North Pacific [378]tropical cyclones was
   '[379]Durian',^[380][57] which was retired after the second storm of
   this name in [381]2006. Being a fruit much loved by a variety of wild
   beasts, the durian sometimes signifies the long-forgotten animalistic
   aspect of humans, as in the legend of [382]Orang Mawas, the Malaysian
   version of Bigfoot, and [383]Orang Pendek, its Sumatran version, both
   of which have been claimed to feast on durians.^[384][58]^[385][59]
