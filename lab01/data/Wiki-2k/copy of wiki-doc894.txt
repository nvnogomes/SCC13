   Edmund L. Gruber was one of the most popular artillerymen of his time
   and was a noted Army polo team champion. But he would make his enduring
   mark with music. He was the author of the 5th Artillery Regimental
   song. Titled "The Caissons Go Rolling Along," it was adopted by all
   regiments of the Artillery and became the Field Artillery Song. It
   later became the Armys Official Song. His song was even used to sell
   vacuum cleaners. General Gruber's family did have a musical background.
   His ancestor, Fr. [47]Franz Gruber, composed the music to the classic
   Christmas song "[48]Silent Night."

   who had served as an artillery officer at Fort Sill, Oklahoma for many
   years. Today Camp Gruber is a training center for the [51]Oklahoma Army
   National Guard.

   Fort Bragg also named one of its major roads after General Gruber.
