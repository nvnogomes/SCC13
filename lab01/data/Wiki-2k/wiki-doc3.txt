[[21]edit] Disney Comics

   Disney Comics was a [22]comic book publishing company operated by
   [23]The Walt Disney Company which ran from 1990 to 1993. In the USA,
   Disney only licensed their comic books to other publishers prior to
   1990, and since 1994 the only publication containing comics and
   published by Disney themselves in the USA is [24]Disney Adventures
   (which ended in 2007), as well as some [25]Hyperion-published
   publications such as [26]W.I.T.C.H.. Prior to 1990, the only
   Disney-published Disney comics were the ones published in Italy, after
   Disney Italia took over from Mondadori in 1988.

[[27]edit] Initial titles

   In its first year and a half, Disney Comics published:
     * [28]Walt Disney's Comics and Stories (issues #548-585)
     * [29]Uncle Scrooge (issues #243-280)
     * [30]Donald Duck Adventures (38 issues)
     * [31]DuckTales (18 issues)
     * [32]Mickey Mouse Adventures (18 issues)
     * [33]Goofy Adventures (17 issues)
     * [34]Roger Rabbit (comic book) (18 issues)
     * [35]Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (19 issues)
     * [36]Tale Spin (7 issues)
     * [37]Roger Rabbit's Toontown (5 issues)

[[38]edit] Initial collections

   Additionally, during the company's first year, eight [39]trade
   paperbacks called Disney Comic Albums were published. These mainly
   featured older stories too big for the regular titles.
    1. [40]Donald Duck and [41]Gyro Gearloose
    2. Uncle Scrooge and the Phantom of Notre Duck
    3. Donald Duck in Dangerous Disguise
    4. [42]Mickey Mouse Outwits the [43]Phantom Blot
    5. Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers: The Secret Casebook
    6. Uncle Scrooge in Tralla-La
    7. Donald Duck in Too Many Pets!
    8. [44]Super Goof - The World's Silliest Super-Hero!

   Giant-sized seasonal specials included two issues of Holiday Parade and
   one issue of Summer Fun.

[[45]edit] Planned expansion

   In this period plans for expansion were announced. At one [46]Comic Con
   panel slides of a realistic European barbarian strip were previewed as
   part of a new line of books that would also include superheroes. In
   addition, a second imprint, Touchmark Comics, was announced, with
   former DC editor Art Young at its head. Among the scripts Touchmark
   acquired was [47]Enigma by [48]Peter Milligan and [49]Sebastian O by
   [50]Grant Morrison.

   Editor-in-Chief [51]Len Wein's [52]Marvel Comics-esque approach to the
   Disney characters was criticized by many older Disney fans. The hiring
   of Wein has been championed by the comic book creative community as an
   alternative to the much disliked former Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief
   [53]Jim Shooter, who had made a favorable impression when interviewed
   by Disney management. Prior to the launch of the comics division,
   Disney management proclaimed their intention to quickly become a
   dominant presence in the comic book market, competing with industry
   leaders [54]DC and [55]Marvel.

[[56]edit] The "Disney Implosion"

   These unreasonable expectations, coupled with poor sales, led to a mass
   cancellation in 1991. Echoing what had been called the [57]DC Implosion
   of the 1970s, Duckburg Times editor Dana Gabbard dubbed this the Disney
   Implosion. Walt Disney's Comics and Stories, Uncle Scrooge, and Donald
   Duck Adventures were the only surviving titles. (No indication has been
   given whether or not the fact that they survived had anything to do
   with Donald Duck being a starring character in all three.)

[[58]edit] Remaining titles

   Following the implosion, the three titles continued being published
   along with an occasional mini-series based on a TV show or a movie.
   These included:
     * [59]Junior Woodchucks
     * [60]Darkwing Duck
     * [61]The Little Mermaid
     * [62]Disney's Comics in 3-D
     * [63]Sebastian

     * Donald and Scrooge

     * [64]Beauty and the Beast
     * [65]Dinosaurs
     * [66]Aladdin

   All plans for expansion, however, were cancelled. Art Young moved back
   to DC, and many of the unpublished Touchmark titles were published as
   part of its new [67]Vertigo imprint. Wein left and [68]Marv Wolfman
   concentrated on being comics editor of [69]Disney Adventures. In a
   mini-renaissance, editors Bob Foster, Cris Palomino, and David Seidman
   brought an appreciation of the classic Disney characters to the three
   continuing titles. Foster especially after a lifetime of involvement
   with Disney comic books and strips specialized in reprinting rarities
   even seasoned fans were unaware of. The Disney Studio finally decided
   to shut down its comic book publishing division in 1993.

[[70]edit] Licenses

   In 1990, [71]Gladstone Publishing was granted a new license to publish
   a series of softcover albums aimed at the collectors market, reprinting
   in color the stories of [72]Carl Barks. After Disney Comics shut down
   in 1993, Gladstone regained the comics license for the classic Disney
   characters, which they resumed publishing until 1998, while [73]Marvel
   Comics obtained the license for the modern Disney characters in 1994
   and published them until they sold their rights to Acclaim in 1997.
