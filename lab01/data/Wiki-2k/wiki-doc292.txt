[[49]edit] Early life and career

   Douglas Wimberley was born on 15 August 1896 at 8 Ardross Terrace,
   [50]Inverness, the son of Surgeon-Captain (later Colonel) Charles Neil
   Campbell Wimberley, and Minnie Lesmoir Gordon, daughter of R.J.
   Wimberley.

   Wimberley was educated at Alton Burn, [51]Nairn, [52]Wellington College
   and then the [53]Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned
   as a second lieutenant into the [54]Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in
   1915. On the [55]Western Front he served first with the [56]1st
   Division and then with the [57]51st (Highland) Division. During his
   period with the Highland Division he was wounded and won the
   [58]Military Cross at the [59]Battle of Cambrai (1917).

   In 1918 Wimberley was promoted acting and temporary major and
   dispatched to [60]Russia and in 1919 was attached to the [61]Machine
   Gun Corps. In 1921 Wimberley served as the Assistant Adjutant of the
   [62]Cameron Highlanders stationed at [63]Queenstown during the
   [64]Irish War of Independence. Wimberley's battalion was regarded by
   the brigade-major of the parent Cork Brigade, a certain [65]Bernard Law
   Montgomery to be the best troops available to act as a "flying column"
   to round up rebels ^[66][1]. 1922 saw Wimberley made an adjutant of the
   [67]2nd Camerons. Two years later he gained distinction in promotion
   examinations and was allowed to spend a year at [68]Emmanuel College,
   Cambridge.

   Following his studies, Wimberley went on to the [69]Staff College,
   Camberley in 1925, where he was a student of a class of instructors who
   would lead the [70]British Army to victory in the next war, such as
   Montgomery and [71]Alan Brooke, with fellow students as august as
   [72]Harold Alexander, [73]Miles Dempsey, [74]Oliver Leese, [75]Gerald
   Templer ^[76][2]. On 29 April of that year, he married Elsye Myrtle
   Livingston, daughter of Captain F.L. Campbell RN of [77]Achalader,
   [78]Perthshire. With her he had one son and one daughter.

   After his marriage the still-young Wimberley's peacetime career
   progressed steadily. In 1929 he was appointed brigade-major of the
   [79]1st Gurkha Brigade which was involved in operations on the
   [80]North West Frontier Province a year later. In 1933 he was promoted
   brevet major, the same year that he won the Army Quarterly military
   prize for an essay on recent military campaigns.

   He served as a GSO2 at the [81]War office for four years before
   returning to an active command in 1938 when he was promoted
   lieutenant-colonel and given command of the [82]1st Cameron
   Highlanders, which he commanded until the outbreak of war a year later.

[[83]edit] World War II

   The first year of the [84]Second World War saw Wimberley take his
   battalion to [85]France, as part of the [86]5th Brigade, [87]2nd
   Division, [88]I Corps. In December 1939 Wimberley was made GSO1 and
   Chief Instructor at the Senior Officers' School at Sheerness, so
   missing the hostillities in France. In August 1940 he was promoted
   brigadier and in quick succession he commanded the [89]13th Brigade,
   the [90]152nd Seaforth and Cameron Brigade and as acting major-general,
   the [91]46th Division. In June 1941, after only a month at 46 Division,
   he took command of the [92]51st (Highland) Division at the specific
   request of his predecessor, [93]Neil Ritchie, who had been his
   divisional commander when leading the Seaforth and Cameron Brigade and
   who was being posted to the Middle East.^[94][3]

   The 51st (Highland) Division was a very different formation from that
   which he had been a part of in the previous war. Formerly, the division
   had been forged over successive battles in the trenches. The division
   which he now commanded was in reality the untried [95]9th (Highland)
   Division, the sister Territorial Force division to the 51st, which had
   been renumbered after the latter's surrender in France, June 1940. The
   division as it stood would not be able to fight as a unit, and
   Wimberley, now major-general made a successful effort to instill a
   sense of esprit de corps in the unit. He refused [96]sassenach troops
   for his brigades and battalions whilst "poaching" Scottish troops from
   other units, and appealed to his men's Scottish patriotism by
   encouraging the wearing of their respective tartans as much as
   possible, for which he was dubbed "Tartan Tam". The only non-highland
   unit was 1/7 Middlesex Regiment because there was no machine gun
   battalion in the British Army which recruited exclusively in
   Scotland.^[97][3] At the same time training was not neglected. The
   results would manifest themselves in action.

   In August 1942 the division arrived in Egypt to join the [98]Eighth
   Army. It went into the line on 17 September as part of [99]XXX Corps as
   the new Eighth Army commander Lieutenant-General [100]Bernard
   Montgomery prepared for the offensive which would defeat the Axis
   forces in North Africa. In October and November the Division figured
   prominently in the "break-in" and "crumbling phase" of the [101]Battle
   of Alamein and actions round [102]Kidney Ridge. Before the battle
   Wimberley had briefed his COs with a model of the battlefield and
   instructed them to repeat their tasks as he had shown them, so as to
   ensure the unity of the division's battle plan.

   Before and during the battle, Wimberley had become a familiar sight
   touring the divisional areas, an incongruous spectacle in his jeep with
   his knees nearly reaching head height. During the battle Wimberley's
   jeep was blown up by a mine, killing two of the occupants but only
   badly shaking Wimberley himself.^[103][4] He often paused to assist
   troops carrying out work or briefed individual privates so as to make
   them better understand the part which they were to play. Therefore, the
   casualties suffered by Eighth Army, amounting to nearly a quarter of
   the infantry force, caused Wimberley to comment "never again". Having
   observed in the closing stages of the battle an assault by his
   Highlanders which had gone in without an artillery barrage, he wrote:

   The position was, as we had reported, strongly held, not a sign of our
   tanks was to be seen, but plenty of enemy ones...The Gordons made
   little progress, and lost a lot of men; I felt it had been sheer waste
   of life and was sick at heart ^[104][5]

   Known, trusted and respected by Eighth Army commander Montgomery,
   Wimberley fought his division across North Africa and into [105]Tunisia
   fighting at [106]Mareth, [107]Medinine, Akarit and Enfidaville, and
   Adrano. In 1942 he was awarded the [108]Distinguished Service Order for
   his actions.

   The pace of the pursuit of [109]Erwin Rommel - the fear of another
   battle of attrition like Alamein - began to tell. In his unpublished
   memoirs, Wimberley wrote of the [110]Battle of Agheila:

   The 14th December is a day I will never forget....As I motored forward
   I saw every 100 yards or so wounded men, mostly sappers who had become
   casualties on the mines. The black Macadam road wound through the soft
   sand of the desert, pitch black in the brilliant sunshine. At intervals
   all down the road, mile after mile, the enemy had spread shovel-fulls
   of sand, and under every sixth heap or so, a mine had been buried, a
   hole having been drilled in the tarmac for it.

   About every quarter of a mile along the road derelict vehicles had been
   pulled across it, to block it, and each vehicle was a mass of trip
   wires and booby traps....I was told the very corpses of our poor dead,
   which we lost out on patrol, were all booby trapped, when later the
   burial parties went out to clear the battlefield and bury them....
   Never again, while I commanded the Highland Division, did we ever meet
   such a heavily mined area ^[111][6]

   To Wimberley was entrusted the task of taking [112]Buerat and opening
   the way to [113]Tripoli, before supplies ran out over a tenuous chain
   of communication, so fast had the Eighth Army advanced. Having opened
   the way to the city - the first major Axis prize to fall in the whole
   of the War so far - Wimberley's achievement went un-recognised by
   Montgomery who accused him of "dilatoriness" ^[114][7]. Wimberley
   forgave all during the [115]Battle of Medenine, however, when he wrote
   "I felt grateful, and thought, again, what a wonderful little commander
   I was serving under, in Monty." ^[116][8]

   In July 1943 Wimberley led the Highland Division during the [117]Allied
   invasion of Sicily. The division was involved in heavy fighting until
   gradually being relieved in August by [118]78th Infantry Division.
   Despite the renowned fighting ability and reputation of the 51st,
   Montgomery decided after the Sicily in August 1943 that Wimberley,
   showing tiredness after after two years in command, should be removed
   from divisional command ^[119][9]. Whilst Montgomery judged him
   unsuitable for Corps command, he recommended Wimberley to his mentor
   and friend [120]General Alan Brooke, the [121]Chief of the Imperial
   General Staff, for a position at the [122]Staff College, Camberley, a
   recommendation which was accepted. In December 1944 he was appointed
   Director of Infantry, his last appointment in the [123]British Army
   which he held until his resignation in October 1946, when it became
   clear that with Montgomery having become CIGS, he would progress no
   higher in the army.^[124][10]

[[125]edit] Post-war

   Upon leaving the army Wimberley became principal of University College,
   Dundee, which was at the time a constituent college of the
   [126]University of St Andrews. The University of St Andrews, steeped in
   tradition and jealous of its academic reputation refused to allow the
   academic expansion of its sister college which led to agitation in
   [127]Dundee for the independence of the Dundee College. Wimberley
   attempted to expand University College whilst at the same time not
   undermining the parent University, and its principal, Sir [128]James
   Irvine.

   Without much academic power, Wimberley sought to give the College the
   same esprit de corps with which he had invigorated the 51st (Highland)
   Division. He worked as closely with the staff and students of the
   college as he had with the officers and men of his division. He
   continually made efforts to improve facilities and conditions and to
   give the young institution its own traditions, he instituted a
   ceremonial university service at the local parish kirk.

   In 1947 he wrote the "Wimberley Memo", which set the scene for the
   parting of ways between the University of St Andrews, and the former
   University College, Dundee. In honour of this event, the
   [129]University of Dundee awards annually the Wimberley Award to the
   student who has contributed most to university life.

   In 1954, Wimberly was made to stand-down from his position in Dundee
   due to the rotation of principal seats. Having retired, he took up
   [130]genealogy and lived with his wife in the town of [131]Coupar
   Angus, [132]Perthshire. From 1951 to 1961 he was colonel of the
   [133]Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders. In 1973, Wimberley collated his
   papers and diaries into a five-volume autobiography called Scottish
   Soldier. This unpublished memoir was deposited by the general in the
   [134]National Library of Scotland [135][1].

   He died at Foxhall, Coupar Angus, on 26 August 1983. He is survived by
   his son Neil Wimberley, who lives with his wife in Foxhall, and
   daughter Lesmoir Edington living near Gladsmuir in East Lothian,
   Scotland.
