   Neopets (originally NeoPets) is a [31]virtual pet [32]website launched
   by [33]Adam Powell and Donna Williams on 15 November 1999.^[34][1] Six
   months after the web site was launched, Adam Powell and Donna Williams
   successfully sold a majority share to a consortium of investors led by
   [35]Doug Dohring. On 20 June 2005, [36]Viacom bought Neopets, Inc. for
   $160 million ([37]USD).^[38][2]

   Neopets is based around the virtual pets that inhabit the [39]virtual
   world of Neopia. Visitors can create an account and take care of up to
   four virtual pets, buying them food, toys, clothes, and other
   accessories using a virtual currency called Neopoints. Neopoints can be
   earned through playing games, investing in the game's [40]stock market,
   trading, and winning contests. Users can explore the world of Neopia
   with their Neopets and interact with each other through the NeoBoards,
   NeoMail, guilds, and Key Quest.

   Neopets also operates a [41]pay-to-play version known as [42]Neopets
   Premium, which offers additional features and benefits for a monthly
   fee of $7.99 ([43]USD). Neopets, Inc. produces and sells a wide variety
   of Neopets merchandise, such as plushies, stickers, notebooks, three
   video games and a [44]trading card game. While the site has been
   praised for being "gentle" and educational, several issues such as
   immersive advertising and gambling-based games have garnered criticism.

[[56]edit] History

          See also: [57]Neopets, Inc.

   Neopets was conceived by Adam Powell while studying at the
   [58]University of Nottingham in 1997. Powell left and started UK-based
   advertising company Shout! Advertising in 1996, which grew to be the
   third largest click-through program on the Internet by 1999. He also
   co-founded Netmagic, an online banner advertising design and sales firm
   and Powlex Ltd., a web site design firm.^[59][3] Donna Williams was a
   marketing manager for Shout! Advertising from September 1997 to July
   1999 responsible for internet advertising, sales and services, graphic
   and web design.^[60][3] He and Williams started creating the site in
   September 1999 and launched it two months later on 15 November
   1999.^[61][1] Powell was responsible for the programming and database,
   and Williams the web design and art. The site grew by [62]word of mouth
   and by [63]Christmas of 1999, they received 600,000 [64]page views
   daily and sought investment to cover the high cost of running the
   site.^[65][4] The same month, [66]Doug Dohring was introduced to the
   creators of the site^[67][5] and, along with other investors, bought a
   majority share in January of the following year.^[68][4] [69]Neopets,
   Inc. was created in February 2000 and began business in April. The
   website made profit from the first paying customers for an advertising
   method trademarked as "[70]immersive advertising",^[71][5] touted as
   "an evolutionary step forward in the traditional marketing practice of
   [72]product placement" in television and film.^[73][6]

   [74]Media conglomerate [75]Viacom bought [76]Neopets, Inc. on 20 June
   2005 for $160 million^[77][2] and planned to focus more on [78]banner
   ads instead of immersive advertising.^[79][7] On the first day of the
   [80]2006 FIFA World Cup, the Altador Cup started as an annual
   international online gaming event^[81][8] and had 10.4 million
   participants the first year.^[82][9] The entire Neopets site was
   revamped on 27 April 2007, referred to as Neopets 2.0 in the Neopets
   FAQ.^[83][10] On 17 July 2007, the NC Mall was launched^[84][11] in a
   partnership with Korean gaming company [85]Nexon Corporation.^[86][12]
   The next day, Viacom announced on their website that by the end of
   2008, Neopets would be changing their company name, not the site name
   itself, to NeoStudios, "which will focus on developing new virtual
   world gaming experiences online, while continuing to grow and evolve
   the existing ones." ^[87][13]

   As of June 17th, 2008, NeoStudios was renamed, [88]Nickelodeon Kids &
   Family Virtual Worlds Group and Kyra Reppen was officially announced as
   both Senior Vice President (SVP) and General Manager (GM) of the
   Virtual Worlds Group by Steve Youngwood, Nickelodeon Kids and Family
   Group's Executive Vice President of Digital Media. ^[89][14] As head of
   the Nickelodeon Kids and Family Virtual Worlds Group, Reppen oversees
   strategy, creative development and management of new and existing
   virtual worlds and casual massive multiplayer online games (MMOGs) for
   the company, including Neopets.^[90][15] Other initiatives spearheaded
   by [91]Nickelodeon Kids & Family Virtual Worlds Group include
   partnering with the Nick.com on Nickelodeon's online playground for
   kids, Nicktropolis([92]http://www.nicktropolis.com) and creating new
   virtual world destinations. The group focuses on the building the
   company's current properties with projects like World of Neopia
   (working title), [93]Petpet Park ^[94][16] and of the expansion of
   Nicktropolis with a premium layer. It will also develop original
   properties like the recently announced Monkey World.^[95][17]

   After the changes in ownership, the site still retained its [96]British
   English spellings.^[97][4] To date, since August 2003, the site has
   been translated into ten other written languages: [98]Japanese,
   [99]Traditional and [100]Simplified [101]Chinese, Spanish, German,
   Italian, [102]Korean, Portuguese, [103]Dutch and French.^[104][18]
   However, Neopets announced on 1 January 2009 that the Italian,
   Japanese, and Korean areas of the site would no longer be updated.
   ^[105][19]

[[106]edit] Gameplay

   Neopets is set in the themed lands of the fictional world of Neopia,
   which has its own calendar and timezone running concurrent with the
   real-world [107]Pacific Time.^[108][20] It also has its own
   [109]economy and stock market based around the Neopoint. Players earn
   Neopoints through various means including playing games and selling
   items. Once earned, they can be invested or used to buy various goods
   and services.^[110][21]
   A customizable Neohome

   Users are free to choose their own path in the world of Neopia, from
   collecting things to battling against other users. Visitors can create
   a free [111]account. A user then creates a Neopet and chooses its
   unique name, physical characteristics, and personality^[112][22] and
   may own up to four per account. A newly created pet comes with randomly
   rolled [113]stats used for battling in the Battledome. Players need to
   feed and care for their Neopets when they grow hungry or get sick,
   although they will not die if they are neglected.^[114][23] New users
   start out with a newbie pack of various items that introduce a basic
   feature of the site, such as food for feeding a pet. They can get more
   items for their Neopets by earning Neopoints, the site's currency,
   through various activities including playing games and selling items.
   Some items will change the appearance and even species of a Neopet.

   Users can interact with their Neopets by reading books to them, caring
   for them, and playing with them. This will make their mood better. They
   can train their Neopets to be fighters in the Battledome against other
   player's Neopets or [115]non-player characters. Wearable items, such as
   certain clothing, can be used to customize a Neopet. Players can build
   a customizable Neohome for their Neopets, furnish them, and buy
   extensions that reflect the socioeconomic quality of the house.

   Players can collect certain virtual items and display them in a gallery
   or album. In addition to items, players can also collect trophies,
   [116]avatars, and [117]site themes, although there is no function to
   display the latter two.

   Users found breaking the rules set in the Terms and Conditions may have
   their account suspended, a temporarily blocked, or permanently
   "frozen".

[[118]edit] Site content

   The content of the site is updated almost on a daily basis with the
   addition of new games and items, weekly content, and other
   things.^[119][24] In addition to the site content updated by Neopets,
   players also contribute [120]user-generated content to the
   site.^[121][25] Player contributions come in the form of prescreened
   submissions and readily editable content that is automatically
   filtered, such as the site's weekly electronic newspaper The Neopian
   Times and their own [122]user lookup, respectively.^[123][26]

[[124]edit] Games

   There are many active games from which users can earn Neopoints and
   awards. Before 22 November 2006 the games were divided into three
   categories: Puzzle, Action, and Luck/Chance. After that date the Games
   Room was reconfigured and now games are divided into many more
   categories.^[125][27] Various games and activities include [126]Flash
   and [127]Shockwave games, [128]PHP games, 3D Life Player games,
   contests and spotlights, and quests to retrieve items.

   Neopoints can be earned from playing games, most of which have a set
   maximum of earnings or playtime. Players may also earn trophies for
   their trophy cabinet from games if they score high enough for the
   [129]Hi-Score Tables, which are reset on the first day of each month.
   Challenges may be made against other players or random players in a
   "World Challenge" for a prize piece for certain Flash games. A monthly
   competition also exists for multiplayer PHP games with four week-long
   elimination rounds.

   Neopets offers several different contests and spotlights, where winners
   are chosen by judges on the Neopets staff or voted on by members of the
   Neopets community. Contests include several formats, such as writing a
   story, making a short animated film or drawing a picture of their
   Neopet. Spotlights showcase what users have done with customizable
   content. Winners also receive a trophy and a reward, which varies with
   the contest or spotlight.

   In Australia, a cross-promotion with [130]McDonald's where McDonald's
   promoted Neopets plushies in their Happy Meals and Neopets featured
   McDonald's-related content led to a controversy with Neopets'
   luck/chance games in October 2004. A story on the Australian
   [131]tabloid television show [132]Today Tonight featured a
   nine-year-old boy who claimed that the site requires one to [133]gamble
   in order to receive enough Neopoints to feed one's Neopet or else it
   would be sent to the Pound.^[134][28] While this is factually incorrect
   (gambling is not required, nor are pets ever sent to an orphanage if
   they are not fed), it is true that the website has a number of games of
   chance that are directly based on real-life games such as
   [135]blackjack and lottery [136]scratchcards. In 2004, Neopets
   prohibited users under the age of 13 from playing most games that
   involve gambling because of the boy mentioned above.^[137][4]

[[138]edit] Exclusive content

   Certain features on Neopets require a user to pay some amount of real
   money and include Neopets Premium, Neopets Mobile, and some features of
   the NC Mall. Neopets Premium and Mobile both allow access to areas of
   the site otherwise restricted. Purchase of NeoCash allows use of the NC
   Mall to purchase items to customize a user's Neopet or Neohome, but
   users can sample clothing and furniture before purchase and can win
   free NeoCash on some occasions, including a daily NeoCash giveaway
   called the Qasalan Expellibox, a free 50 NC giveaway from the Advent
   Calendar on 19 December 2008, and a free 50 NC from finding all the
   Halloween goodie bags hidden around the site in Halloween of 2008.

   Neopets Premium is an extended version of the site, for which members
   pay for monthly or yearly subscriptions. With Premium membership,
   external ads are removed and certain benefits are added, like extra
   Neopoints, Premium only forums, own Premium emails and access to
   [139]beta versions of games. Neopets Mobile is a simpler version of the
   site using a web-to-wireless application developed by
   In-Fusio.^[140][29] Initially released to [141]Cingular/AT&T, it allows
   access from a [142]mobile phone where users get exclusive access to
   Lutari Island and other exclusive content.^[143][29]

   The NC Mall allows players to buy items used mainly for customizing
   their Neopets or Neohomes using Neocash. Players must purchase Neocash
   with real money through [144]PayPal. Customers in the United States can
   also buy Neocash cards at [145]Target stores, the Target website, and
   at selected [146]Wal-mart stores.^[147][30] The Mall was created
   through a partnership with [148]Nexon,^[149][12] which also handles the
   sale of [150]NX Cash used in the analogous "Cash Shop" of
   [151]MapleStory. It was initially released for beta on 28 June 2007 and
   then fully released to players in the United States on 17
   July.^[152][11] Two months later, it expanded to English users in other
   countries.^[153][31] Most Neocash purchased items remain with the buyer
   permanently, but could not be transferred or sold to other players
   until recently, when the gift box was introduced. A few items have
   expiration times, after which they disappear from the buyer's accounts.

   In February 2008, Neopets announced Key Quest, a feature that will
   engage users by having them buy Neopets merchandise at Target and other
   stores, using a virtual code to redeem tokens for their user
   accounts.^[154][32]

[[155]edit] Community

   Screenshot of NeoBoards homepage. This screenshot was taken on July 3,
   2007.

   Neopets has a community in which users can chat with and contact each
   other. Users may request other users to be "Neofriends" or block other
   users from contacting them. Players are represented by small icons
   known as [156]avatars that are provided by the website, as players
   cannot upload their own. To comply with [157]COPPA, players under 13
   years of age cannot access any of the site's communication features
   without sending in parental consent.^[158][33] The main features
   include:
     * NeoMail, a personal in-game communication system like regular
       [159]email. Players can write messages to other players and
       restrict who can contact them through NeoMail. However, players
       cannot send messages to another player who is under the age of 13
       unless that player has parental permission.

     * NeoBoards, public [160]discussion boards for on-topic discussions.
       Users can enter their own "neoHTML", a restricted form of
       [161]BBCode, to customize their own posts and signatures, which are
       also used in guilds.

     * Guilds, groups of users with similar interests and their own
       message board. Public guilds can be found through guild listings
       and anyone can join whenever they want, whereas private guilds are
       unlisted and invitation-only. Players are only allowed to be a
       member of one guild.

   Discussions through these features are restricted and may not involve
   topics such as dating and romance or controversial topics like politics
   and religion. Continuous [162]moderation is performed by paid Neopets
   staff members,^[163][33] and users can help moderate the site by
   reporting messages they believe are inappropriate or
   offensive.^[164][33] Messages are also automatically [165]filtered to
   prevent users from posting messages with profanity or lewd
   content,^[166][33] although filters cannot catch everything.

[[167]edit] Immersive advertising

   Immersive advertising is a trademarked term for the way Neopets
   displayed advertisements to generate profit after [168]Doug Dohring
   bought the site.^[169][4] Instead of running [170]pop-up and
   [171]banner ads, immersive ads integrate advertisements into the site's
   content in interactive forms, including games and items. Players can
   earn Neopoints from them by doing things such as playing
   [172]advergames and taking part in online marketing surveys.^[173][34]
   Prior to the arrival of the NC Mall, it contributed to 60% of the
   revenue from the site^[174][23] with paying [175]Fortune 1000 companies
   including [176]Disney, [177]General Mills, and
   [178]McDonald's.^[179][34]

   It was a contentious issue with the site with regard to the [180]ethics
   of marketing to children. Half a million of the 25 million users were
   under the age of eight in 2005 and children under eight have difficulty
   recognizing ads.^[181][4]^[182][35]^[183][34] It draws criticism from
   parents, psychologists, and consumer advocates who argue that children
   may not know that they are trying to be sold something, as it blurs the
   line between site content and advertisement. A psychology professor at
   Georgetown University stated, "It's self marketing, selling to kids
   that don't know they are seeing anything".^[184][35] Dohring responded
   to such criticism:

     "Over 60 percent of our audience is 13 and over, so it is not like
     we are dealing with four- to six-year-olds that may not quite
     understand the difference between content and advertising. And of
     the 40 percent of our users who are 12 or under, the ages start at
     around seven or eight years old and go up from there. The
     preschoolers are not really our audience, because you have to be a
     pretty fluid reader to navigate the site."^[185][36]

   Others criticised the functionality of the site. Susan Linn, another
   psychologist and author of Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of
   Childhood said, "The whole purpose of this site at this point is to
   keep kids in front of products".^[186][35] [187]Kalle Lasn,
   editor-in-chief and co-founder of [188]Adbusters magazine, said the
   site was "encouraging kids to spend hours in front of the screen and at
   the same time recruiting them into consumer culture", which was "the
   most insidious mind-fuck ever".^[189][4] Neopets executives have stated
   in 2004 and 2006 that paid content comprised less than 1% of the site's
   total content.^[190][34]^[191][35] Children are not required to play or
   use sponsor games and items.^[192][37]^[193][4]

   Consumer advocates also argue that immersive ads should be clearly
   labelled as advertisements. Dohring has said, "We're not trying to be
   subliminal or deceive the user. We label all the immersive ad campaigns
   as paid advertisements."^[194][34]

[[195]edit] Reception

   Neopets has been compared to the antecedent virtual pet fad
   [196]Tamagotchi and the [197]Pokmon franchise. It has been described as
   an online cross of Pokmon and Tamagotchi.^[198][5]^[199][37] The
   website maintains high "stickiness" rankings, which is a measure of the
   amount of time a user spends on the site. Neopets has been praised for
   having educational content, such as word games and an [200]HTML
   guide.^[201][38] Its popularity spawned real world plushies, a
   magazine, book series, cereal, and [202]merchandise in other media as
   well.^[203][23]^[204][21]^[205][39]

   A press release from Neopets in 2001 stated that Neopets.com led in
   [206]site "stickiness" in May and June, with the average user spending
   117 minutes a week.^[207][40] Neopets also led in the average number of
   hours spent per user per month in December 2003 with an average of 4
   hours and 47 minutes.^[208][21] A 2004 article stated that
   [209]Nielsen//NetRatings reported that people were spending around
   three hours a month on Neopets, more than any other site in its Nielsen
   category.^[210][41] By May 2005, a Neopets-affiliated video game
   producer cited about 35 million unique users, 11 million unique IP
   addresses per month, and 4 billion web page views per month. This
   producer also described 20% of the users as 18 or older, with the
   median of the remaining 80% at about 14.^[211][42] Neopets was
   consistently ranked among the top ten "stickiest" sites by both
   Nielsen//NetRatings and [212]comScore Media Metrix in 2005 and
   2006.^[213][43]^[214][44] According to Nielsen//NetRatings, in 2007,
   Neopets lost about 15% of its audience over the previous
   year.^[215][45] In February 2008, comScore ranked it as the stickiest
   kids entertainment site with the average user spending 2 hours and 45
   minutes.^[216][46]^[217][47]

   Most of the users are female, higher than in other [218]massively
   multiplayer online games (MMOGs) but equivalent to
   social-networking-driven communities.^[219][48] Cuteness is one of the
   main factors.^[220][48]^[221][35] Open-endedness is another. Lucy
   Bradshaw, a vice president of [222]Electronic Arts, said, "Games that
   have a tendency to satisfy on more than one dimension have a tendency
   to have a broader appeal and attract girls".^[223][49]

[[224]edit] Merchandise

   Viacom produces a range of merchandise, including [225]plushies,
   stickers, books, cereals, Neocash cards for the Nc Mall and [226]video
   games. The merchandise retails at mainstream outlets such as
   [227]Wal-Mart, [228]Target, and [229]Limited Too. There are also
   exclusively online retailers involved, such as [230]Zazzle. Each
   merchandise has a prize code which can be redeemed at the site for an
   in-game reward. Neopets had planned to "bring the online and offline
   worlds together in ways that have never been done before".^[231][50] An
   investment banker at [232]Allen & Company in New York said Neopets was
   the only online media he had seen "that might have the ability to
   capture market share in the offline world".^[233][23] Neopets signed a
   licensing deal with [234]Viacom Consumer Products in 2001 to get the
   right developers and publishers for their offline content.^[235][51] A
   deal with [236]Thinkway Toys produced the first merchandise brought to
   an international market.^[237][52] Offline products expanded in 2005
   with film and video game deals.^[238][23] In February 2008, offline
   products were further expanded when it was announced that [239]Jakks
   Pacific and [240]Enterplay would produce a new line of merchandise,
   including new plushies and trading cards, to tie into Key
   Quest.^[241][32]

   [242]Wizards of the Coast released the [243]Neopets Trading Card Game
   in September 2003 based on the online characters and setting. In 2004,
   the cards were promoted in three of General Mills "Big G"
   cereals^[244][53] and ten [245]Simon Property Group malls.^[246][54]
   The TCG received two different nominations for "Toy of the Year" and
   two other recognitions.^[247][55]

   Neopets: The Official Magazine, published by [248]Beckett Media, was a
   bi-monthly magazine released in September 2003.^[249][56] The magazine
   was sold through a subscription service and in stores, with back issues
   available for order on the magazine web site. The magazine's features
   included Neopet games, stories, guides to the Flash games on the
   Neopets site, news on upcoming site events and merchandise, and
   drawings for readers. It also regularly offered games tied to the site
   that allowed the reader to receive a prize on the Neopets site. After
   26 issues, Beckett sent a notice to subscribers announcing that the
   January 2008 issue would be the final issue of the magazine and that
   Beckett would replace the issues remaining in the subscription with
   their new magazine Beckett Plushie Pals, which would still include some
   Neopets news, but also news related to various other companies,
   including [250]Ganz Webkinz, [251]Disney's Club Penguin, [252]TY Beanie
   Babies, and Kookeys.

   Neopets signed a deal with [253]Warner Bros. Pictures in March 2005 to
   produce films. The unreleased first film was announced to be written by
   Rob Lieber and produced by Dylan Sellers and [254]John A. Davis in
   February 2006 by [255]Variety.^[256][57]

   In November 2005, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. released
   [257]Neopets: The Darkest Faerie, for the [258]PlayStation 2. A second
   game, [259]Neopets: Petpet Adventures: The Wand of Wishing, was
   released 14 March 14 2006 for the [260]PlayStation Portable.

   A very popular form of merchandise for Neopets was their set of toys in
   2005 at McDonald's, which brought many people in to Neopets. A second
   release of Neopet toys occurred at McDonald's because of the success of
   the last promotion.^[261][58] These toys have been released in
   countries such as Australia, USA, Singapore, and the U.K. In September
   2008, Neopets toys came to [262]Burger King in the United States and
   Canada. There were complaints in the U.S. when some Burger Kings were
   not supplied with the proper Kids Meal bags (with virtual prize codes).

   [263]Neopets Puzzle Adventure, a video game developed by [264]Infinite
   Interactive and published by [265]Capcom, was made available for
   [266]Windows PC, the [267]Nintendo DS and [268]Wii on November 25,

   Neocash Cards are sold in many stores around the US and come at
   different prices (e.g. $10 and $25). They are used at the NC Mall
   (released in July 2007) which is a large shop full of clothes, neohome
   items and other stuffs for your Neopet; many of these items are
   animated and very popular. The different prices amount to different
   quantities of Neocash, for example $10 gives 1000 Neocash. Also, if
   your Neopets account is over a specific age such as 48 months+ you are
   able to have access to the Elite Boutique, which is located in the NC
   Mall and suppose to sell NC items that under 48 months cannot see or
   purchase.
