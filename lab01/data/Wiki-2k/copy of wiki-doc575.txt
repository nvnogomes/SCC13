[[17]edit] Fictional character biography

   Aubrey, a close friend of the hero Lord Falsworth, one of the [18]Union
   Jacks, supported peace between Germany and Britain. Around 1938, the
   pair went on a German tour. War began and the two quickly discovered
   the evils of the Nazis. Both were thrown in prison. Falsworth's
   connections helped him but he could not help Aubrey, who was taken
   away.

   German scientists experimented upon Aubrey, while Falsworth became the
   'Destroyer', fighting a guerrilla war against Germany. Aubrey is shrunk
   to just a foot in height but manages to keep the strength of a full
   size man. He was brainwashed and sent to fight the Allies. He was
   eventually captured and reprogrammed. He joins the superhero team, the
   Crusaders, as Dyna-Mite.

   After some time, Aubrey regains his full height and is reunited with
   Falsworth. They began a romantic relationship. Aubrey takes on the
   persona of the Destroyer, evolving it to the Mighty Destroyer.
   Falsworth adopts the Union Jack identity.

   The two continue to battle the Axis powers. After the war, they form
   the [19]V-Battalion, which hunts down war criminals. In 1953, Aubrey
   loses Falsworth in a car accident. He carries on as leader of the
   Battalion's Penance Council.

   At some point, Aubrey has a time travel adventure to the [20]Stone Age,
   which he finds unpleasant.
