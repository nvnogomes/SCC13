   The Dissolution of the Monasteries, sometimes referred to as the
   Suppression of the Monasteries, was the formal process between 1536 and
   1541 by which [52]Henry VIII disbanded monastic communities in
   [53]England, [54]Wales and [55]Ireland and confiscated their property.
   He was given the authority to do this by the [56]Act of Supremacy,
   passed by [57]Parliament in 1534, which made him Supreme Head of the
   Church in England, and by the [58]First Suppression Act (1536) and the
   [59]Second Suppression Act (1539).

[[68]edit] Context

   The Dissolution of the Monasteries did not take place in political
   isolation. Other movements against the authority of the [69]Catholic
   Church had been under way for some time, most of them related to the
   [70]Protestant Reformation in [71]Continental Europe; however, the
   religious changes in England under Henry VIII and Edward VI were of a
   different nature to those taking place in [72]Germany, [73]Bohemia,
   [74]France and [75]Geneva. On the Continent, while the nobles were
   acquiring a taste for Church plunder, there was the added element of
   mass discontent against ecclesiastical power and wealth among common
   people and the lower levels of clergy and civil society. In England the
   early Reformation was directed from the highest levels of society, but
   was met with widespread popular suspicion; spilling over, in particular
   occasions and localities, into active resistance.

   The initial changes resulted in few modifications for England's
   churches - at least superficially. The Protestant flavour of
   innovations expressed in the [76]Ten Articles were reversed when Henry
   VIII expressed his desire for continued orthodoxy with the [77]Six
   Articles of 1539, which remained in effect until after his death.
   [78]Cardinal Wolsey had obtained from the [79]Pope a [80]Papal Bull
   authorising some limited reforms in the English Church as early as
   1518, but reformers (both conservative and radical) had become
   increasingly frustrated at their lack of progress.

   Under Henry, parliamentary acts reforming alleged abuses in the English
   Church were passed in November 1529. They set caps on fees for
   probating wills and mortuary expenses for burial in hallowed ground,
   tightened regulations covering rights of [81]sanctuary for criminals,
   and reduced to two the number of church [82]benefices that could in the
   future be held by one man. These sought to demonstrate that
   establishing royal jurisdiction over the Church would ensure progress
   in "religious reformation" where Papal authority had been insufficient.

[[83]edit] English precedents

   By the time Henry VIII turned his mind to the business of monastic
   reform, royal action to suppress religious houses had a history
   stretching back more than 200 years. The first case was that of the
   so-called [84]'Alien Priories'. As a result of the [85]Norman Conquest
   some French religious orders held substantial property through their
   daughter monasteries in England. Some of these were merely agricultural
   estates with a single foreign monk in residence to supervise things,
   others were rich foundations in their own right (e.g. [86]Lewes Priory
   which was a daughter of [87]Cluny and answered to the abbot of that
   great French house). Owing to the fairly constant state of war between
   England and France in the Late [88]Middle Ages successive English
   governments had objected to money going overseas to France from these
   Alien Priories ('trading with the enemy') whence the French king might
   get hold of it, and to foreign prelates having jurisdiction over
   English monasteries. Furthermore, after 1378, French monasteries (and
   hence alien priories dependent on them) maintained allegiance to the
   continuing [89]Avignon Papacy, and so their suppression was supported
   by the rival Popes, conditional on all confiscated monastic property
   eventually being redirected into other religious uses. The king's
   officers first sequestrated the assets of the Alien Priories in
   1295-1303 under [90]Edward I, and the same thing happened repeatedly
   for long periods over the course of the Fourteenth Century, most
   particularly in the reign of [91]Edward III. Those Alien Priories that
   had functioning communities were forced to pay large sums to the king,
   while those that were mere estates were confiscated and run by royal
   officers, the proceeds going to the king's pocket. Such estates were a
   valuable source of income for the Crown in its French wars. Some of the
   Alien Priories were allowed to become naturalised (for instance
   [92]Castle Acre Priory), on payment of heavy fines and bribes, but for
   the rest their fates were sealed when [93]Henry V dissolved them by act
   of Parliament in 1414. The properties went to the Crown; some were
   kept, some were subsequently given or sold to Henry's supporters,
   others went to his new monasteries of [94]Syon Abbey and the
   [95]Carthusians at [96]Sheen Priory; yet others went to educational
   purposes. All these suppressions enjoyed Papal approval, though
   successive 15th century Popes continued to press for assurances that,
   now that the Avignon Papacy had been defeated, the confiscated monastic
   property would revert to religious and educatinal uses.

   The royal transfer of monastic estates to educational foundations
   proved an inspiration to the bishops, and as the Fifteenth Century
   waned such moves became more and more common. The subjects of these
   dissolutions were usually small and poor [97]Benedictine or
   [98]Augustinian men's houses or poor nunneries with few powerful
   friends; the great abbeys and orders exempt from diocesan supervision
   such as the [99]Cistercians were unaffected. The consequent new
   foundations were most often [100]Oxford University and [101]Cambridge
   University colleges, instances of this include [102]John Alcock,
   [103]Bishop of Ely dissolving the Benedictine nunnery of [104]Saint
   Radegund to found [105]Jesus College, Cambridge (1496), and
   [106]William Waynflete, [107]Bishop of Winchester acquiring
   [108]Selborne Priory in 1484 for [109]Magdalen College, Oxford. In the
   following century [110]Lady Margaret Beaufort obtained the property of
   Creake Abbey (whose religious had all died of [111]Black Death in 1506)
   to fund her works at Oxford and Cambridge, an action she took on the
   advice of such a staunch traditionalist as [112]John Fisher Bishop of
   Rochester. In 1522 Fisher himself is also found dissolving the
   nunneries of Bromhall and Higham to aid [113]St John's College,
   Cambridge. That same year Cardinal Wolsey dissolved [114]St
   Frideswide's Priory (now [115]Oxford Cathedral) to form the basis of
   his [116]Christ Church, Oxford; in 1524 he secured a [117]Papal bull to
   dissolve some 20 other monasteries to provide an endowment for his new
   college. In all these suppressions, friars, monks and nuns of were
   absorbed into other houses of their respective orders. The conventional
   wisdom of the time was that the proper daily observance of the
   [118]Divine Office of prayer required a minimum of twelve professed
   religious, but by the 1530s only a minority of religious houses in
   England could provide this; and accordingly most observers were agreed
   that a systematic reform of the English church must necessarily involve
   the drastic concentration of monks and nuns into many fewer, larger,
   houses; potentially making much monastic income available for more
   productive religious purposes.

[[119]edit] Continental precedents

   While these transactions were going on in England, elsewhere in Europe
   events were taking place which presaged a storm. In 1521, [120]Martin
   Luther had published 'De votis monasticis' ([121]Latin: 'On the
   monastic vows'), a treatise which declared that the monastic life had
   no scriptural basis, was pointless and also actively immoral in that it
   was not compatible with the true spirit of Christianity. Luther also
   declared that monastic vows were meaningless and that no one should
   feel bound by them. Luther, a one-time monk, found some comfort when
   these views had a dramatic effect: a special meeting of German members
   of the [122]Augustinian Friars, (of which Luther was part) held the
   same year accepted them and voted that henceforth every member of the
   [123]regular clergy should be free to renounce their vows, resign their
   offices and to get married. At Luther's home monastery in
   [124]Wittenberg all the monks save one did so.

   News of these events did not take long to spread among
   Protestant-minded (and acquisitive) rulers across Europe, and some,
   particularly in Scandinavia, moved very quickly. In [125]Sweden in 1527
   King [126]Gustavus Vasa secured an edict of the Diet allowing him to
   confiscate any monastic lands he deemed necessary to increase royal
   revenues; and to force the return of donated properties to the
   descendants of those who had donated them. In one fell swoop, Gustav
   gained large estates and a company of diehard supporters. The Swedish
   monasteries and convents were simultaneously deprived of their
   livelihoods, with the result that some collapsed immediately, while
   others lingered on for a few decades before persecution and further
   confiscations finally caused them all to disappear by 1580. In
   [127]Denmark, King [128]Frederick I of Denmark made his grab in 1528,
   confiscating 15 of the houses of the wealthiest monasteries and
   convents. Further laws under his successor over the course of the 1530s
   banned the friars, and forced monks and nuns to transfer title to their
   houses to the Crown, which passed them out to supportive nobles, who
   were soon found enjoying the fruits of former monastic lands. Danish
   monastic life was to vanish in a way identical to that of Sweden.

   In [129]Switzerland, too, monasteries came under threat. In 1523 the
   government of the city-state of [130]Zurich pressured nuns to leave
   their convents and marry, and followed up the next year by dissolving
   all monasteries in its territory, under the pretext of using their
   revenues to fund education and help the poor. The former religious who
   cooperated with the scheme were offered help with learning a trade for
   their new secular lives, and in some cases were granted pensions. The
   city of [131]Basel followed suit in 1529 and [132]Geneva adopted the
   same policy in 1530. An attempt was also made in 1530 to dissolve the
   famous [133]Abbey of St. Gall, which was a state of the [134]Holy Roman
   Empire in its own right, but this failed, and St. Gall has survived.

   It is inconceivable that these moves went unnoticed by the English
   government and particularly by Thomas Cromwell, shortly to become Henry
   VIII's chief minister, who promised to make his king wealthier than any
   previous English monarch.

[[135]edit] Process

   Visitation of a monastery

   On failing famously to receive his desired annulment from the Pope,
   Henry had himself declared [136]Supreme Head of the Church in England
   in February 1531. In April 1533 an [137]Act in Restraint of Appeals
   eliminated the right of clergy to appeal to "foreign tribunals" (Rome)
   over the King's head in any spiritual or financial matter. All
   ecclesiastical charges and levies that had previously been payable to
   Rome, would now go to the King. Those who refused to assent to the
   Royal Supremacy were liable to execution for treason - a fate which
   befell the London [138]Carthusians and Observant [139]Franciscans in
   1535, with the consequent confiscation of their religious houses.

   In 1534 Henry had [140]Parliament authorise [141]Thomas Cromwell, to
   [142]"visit" all the [143]monasteries (which included all [144]abbeys,
   [145]priories and [146]convents), ostensibly to make sure their members
   were instructed in the new rules for their supervision by the King
   instead of the [147]Pope. In the meanwhile, Cromwell had also
   undertaken an inventory of the assets and income of the entire
   eccelesiastical estate of England and Wales, including the monasteries
   (see [148]Valor Ecclesiasticus), through local commissioners who
   reported in May 1535. Cromwell's visitation authority was delegated to
   a commission of laymen including Layton, Pollard and [149]Moyle for the
   purposes of ascertaining the quality of religious life being maintained
   in religious houses; of assessing the prevalence of 'superstitious'
   religious observances, such as the veneration of [150]relics; and for
   inquiring into evidence of moral laxity (especially sexual). In the
   summer of that year, the visitors started their work. Monastic life,
   numerically speaking and to some extent in the rigour of their
   lifestyle, had been in decline for some time. By 1536, the thirteen
   [151]Cistercian houses in Wales held only 85 monks amongst them.
   However, the claims of misbehaviour had been greatly exaggerated, often
   recalling events and scandals from years before.

   This phase is termed the "Visitation of the Monasteries."

   In the autumn of 1535, the visiting commissioners were sending back to
   Cromwell written reports of all the lurid doings they claimed to have
   discovered. In a few instances, impropriety and irreligion had been so
   great that the commissioners had felt compelled to suppress a house on
   the spot; in others, the abbot, prior or noble patron was reported to
   be petitioning the King for a house to be dissolved. Such authority had
   formerly rested with the Pope, but now the King would need to establish
   a legal basis for dissolution in statutory law. Accordingly Parliament
   enacted laws in early 1536, relying in large part on the reports of
   "impropriety" Cromwell had received, establishing the power of the King
   to dissolve religious houses that were failing to maintain a religious
   life; and consequently providing for the King to compulsorily dissolve
   monasteries with annual incomes of less than 200 (of which there were
   potentially 419); but also giving the King the discretion to exempt any
   of these houses from dissolution at his pleasure. Accordingly, many
   monasteries proposed for dissolution put forward a case for
   continuation, offering to pay substantial fines in recompense; and many
   of these cases were accepted, so that only 243 houses were actually
   dissolved at this time.

   The houses identified for suppression were then visited by a further
   set of commissioners charged with effecting the arrangements for
   closure, and empowered to obtain prompt co-operation from monastic
   superiors by the offer of pensions and cash gratuities. The property of
   the dissolved smaller houses reverted to the Crown and Cromwell
   established a new government agency, the [152]Court of Augmentations to
   manage it; while the ordinary monks and nuns were given the choice of
   secularization (with a cash gratuity but no pension), or of transfer to
   a continuing larger house of the same order. The majority chose to
   remain in the religious life, and, in some areas, the premises of
   suppressed religious houses were recycled into newly founded houses to
   accommodate them. Two houses, [153]Norton Priory in [154]Cheshire, and
   [155]Hexham Abbey in [156]Northumberland, attempted to resist the
   commissioners by force; actions which Henry interpreted as treason,
   resulting in his writing personally to demand the summary brutal
   punishment of those responsible. The prior and canons of Norton were
   imprisoned for several months, and were fortunate to escape with their
   lives; the monks of Hexham, who made the further mistake of becoming
   involved in [157]Pilgrimage of Grace, were executed.

   The first round of suppresssions contributed to popular discontent in
   the [158]Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536; an event which led to Henry
   increasingly associating monasticism with treason, as members of
   several religious houses (more or less willingly) sided with the
   rebels, with former monks resuming religious life in several of the
   suppressed houses. Although Henry continued for a while to maintain
   that his sole objective was monastic reform, it became increasingly
   clear that official policy now envisaged the total end of monasticism.
   Government lawyers then scripted a legal pretext, in that the superior
   of a religious house (abbot, abbess, prior or prioress) was the "owner"
   of the monastic property of the house; and hence, if the superior were
   to be convicted of treason, all the property of the abbey would legally
   revert to the Crown. One major Abbey whose monks had been closely
   implicated in the rebellion was that of [159]Furness in Lancashire; and
   the abbot, fearful of a treason charge, petitioned to be allowed to
   make a voluntary surrender of his house, which Cromwell happily
   approved. From then on, all dissolutions that were not a consequence of
   convictions for treason, were legally "voluntary"; a principle that was
   taken a stage further with the voluntary surrender of [160]Lewes priory
   in November 1537, when for the first time the monks were offered life
   pensions if they co-operated. This created a "stick and carrot" in
   favour of further dissolution. Abbots and priors came under pressure
   from their communities to offer voluntary surrender, if they could
   obtain favourable terms for pensions; while also knowing that if they
   refused to surrender, they might suffer the penalty for treason; and
   their religious house would be dissolved anyway. In 1538 applications
   for surrender became a flood, and Cromwell appointed local
   commissioners to encourage rapid compliance with the King's wishes, to
   supervise the orderly sale of monastic goods and buildings, and to
   ensure that the former monks and nuns were provided with cash
   gratuities and clothing. Monks or nuns who were handicapped or infirm
   were marked out for more generous treatment, and care was taken
   throughout that there should be nobody cast out of their place
   unprovided for (who might otherwise have increased the burden of
   charity for local parishes). The endowments of the monasteries, landed
   property and appropriated parish [161]tithes and [162]glebe, were
   transferred to the [163]Court of Augmentations, who would thereon pay
   out life pensions at the agreed rate (subject to a 10% tax deduction).

   None of this process of legislation and visitation had applied to the
   houses of the [164]friars. At the beginning of the 14th century there
   had been around 5,000 friars in England, occupying extensive complexes
   in all towns of any size. But by the 16th century their income from
   donations had collapsed, their numbers had shrunk to under 1,000 and
   their buildings were often ruinous, or leased out commercially.
   Consequently, almost all friars were now living outside their friaries;
   many, in contravention of their formal rules, supported themselves
   through paid employment and some held personal property. In 1538
   Cromwell deputed Richard Ingworth, Bishop of Dover and former
   Provincial of the [165]Dominicans, to obtain the friars' surrender;
   which he did by drafting new injunctions that strictly enforced each
   order's rule, facing the friars with the choice of compliance with the
   king's wishes, or starvation. On surrender, the friars received a
   gratuity of 40 shillings each, but were not offered pensions.

   In April 1539 Parliament passed a new law legalising acts of voluntary
   surrender, but by then the vast majority of monasteries in England,
   Ireland and Wales had already been dissolved. Some resisted, and that
   autumn the [166]abbots of [167]Colchester, [168]Glastonbury, and
   [169]Reading were [170]hanged, drawn and quartered for [171]treason.
   [172]St. Benet's Abbey in [173]Norfolk was the only abbey in England
   which escaped formal dissolution, its estates being transferred
   directly to the bishops of [174]Norwich.

   The local commissioners were instructed to ensure that, where abbey
   churches were also used for parish worship, this should continue.
   Accordingly over a hundred monastic churches survive in whole or in
   part. Otherwise the most marketable fabric in monastic buildings was
   likely to be the lead on roofs, gutters and plumbing, and buildings
   were burned down as the easiest way to extract this. Building stone and
   slate roofs were sold off to the highest bidder. Many monastic
   outbuildings were turned into granaries, barns and stables. In some
   instances, wealthy parishes purchased a church for their own purpose,
   and many others bought choir stalls and stained glass windows. Cromwell
   had already instigated a campaign against "superstitions": pilgrimages
   and veneration of saints, in the course of which, ancient and precious
   valuables were grabbed and melted down; the tombs of saints and kings
   ransacked for whatever profit could be got from them, and their
   [175]relics destroyed or dispersed. Even the crypt of King [176]Alfred
   the Great was not spared the looting frenzy. Great abbeys and priories
   like [177]Glastonbury, [178]Walsingham, [179]Bury St. Edmunds, and
   [180]Shaftesbury which had flourished as pilgrimage sites for many
   centuries, were soon reduced to ruins. However, the tradition that
   there was widespread mob action resulting in destruction and
   [181]iconoclasm, that [182]altars and [183]windows were smashed, partly
   confuses the looting spree of the 1530s with the vandalism wrought by
   the [184]Puritans in the next century against the Anglican privileges.

   The Crown became richer to the extent of around 150,000 per year, and
   Cromwell had intended that the bulk of this wealth should serve as
   regular income of government. However, after Cromwell's fall in 1540,
   Henry needed money quickly to fund his military ambitions in France and
   Scotland; and so monastic property was sold off, usually at the market
   rate of twenty years' income; raising over 1,400,000 by 1547. The
   purchasers were predominantly leading nobles, local magnates and
   gentry, with no particular opinion in terms of Catholic or Protestant
   religion other than utility. The Court of Augmentations retained lands
   and spiritual income sufficient to meet its continuing obligations to
   pay annual pensions; but as pensioners died off, or as pensions were
   extinguished when their holders accepted a royal appointment of higher
   value, then surplus property became available each year for further
   disposal. The last surviving monks continued to draw their pensions
   into the reign of James I.

   The Dissolution of the Monasteries impinged relatively little on
   English parish church activity. Most parish churches were endowed with
   [185]chantries, maintaining a stipended priest to say [186]mass for the
   souls of their donors. In addition there remained over a hundred
   [187]collegiate churches in England, whose endowments supported a
   collegiate body of [188]canons, [189]prebends or priests. All these
   survived the reign of Henry VIII largely intact, only to be dissolved
   under the [190]Chantries Act of 1547, by Henry's son [191]Edward VI,
   their property being absorbed into the Court of Augmentations, and
   their members being added to the pensions list. Since many former monks
   had found employment as chantry priests, the consequence for these
   clerics was a double experience of dissolution, perhaps mitigated by
   being in receipt thereafter of a double pension.

[[192]edit] Consequences

   The abbeys of England, Wales and Ireland had been among the greatest
   landowners and the largest institutions in the kingdom; although, by
   the early 16th Century, religious donors increasingly tended to favour
   parish churches, collegiate churches, university colleges and grammar
   schools, and these were now the predominant centres for learning and
   the arts. Nevertheless, and particularly in areas far from London, the
   abbeys, convents and priories were centres of hospitality and learning,
   and everywhere they remained a main source of charity for the old and
   infirm. The removal of over eight hundred such institutions, virtually
   overnight, rent great gaps in the social fabric.

   In addition, about a quarter of net monastic wealth on average
   consisted of "spiritual" income arising from the [195]appropriation of
   parish [196]tithes where the religious house held the [197]advowson of
   a [198]benefice with the legal obligation to maintain the cure of souls
   in the parish, either by endowing a [199]vicar or by appointing a
   [200]stipendiary priest. On the dissolution these spiritual income
   streams were sold off on the same basis as landed endowments, creating
   a new class of lay [201]impropriators, who thereby became entitled to
   the income from tithes and [202]glebe lands, albeit that they also as
   lay [203]rectors became liable to maintain the fabric of the parish
   chancel. Where the monastery had not endowed a [204]vicar, the lay
   rector was additionally obliged to establish a stipend for a
   [205]perpetual curate.

   It is unlikely that the monastic system could have been broken simply
   by royal action had there not been the overwhelming bait of personal
   enrichment for [206]gentry large and small, and the convictions of the
   small but determined Protestant faction. [207]Anti-clericalism was a
   familiar feature of late medieval Europe, producing its own strain of
   satiric literature that was aimed at a literate middle class.^[208][1]

   Along with the destruction of the monasteries, some of them many
   hundreds of years old, the related destruction of the monastic
   [209]libraries was perhaps the greatest cultural loss caused by the
   English Reformation. [210]Worcester Priory (now Worcester Cathedral)
   had 600 books at the time of the dissolution. Only six of them are
   known to have survived intact to the present day. At the abbey of the
   Augustinian Friars at York, a library of 646 volumes was destroyed,
   leaving only three known survivors. Some books were destroyed for their
   precious bindings, others were sold off by the cartload. The
   antiquarian [211]John Leland was commissioned by the King to rescue
   items of particular interest (especially manuscript sources of Old
   English history), and other collections were made by private
   individuals; notably [212]Matthew Parker. Nevertheless much was lost,
   especially manuscript books of English church music, none of which had
   then been printed.

     John Bale, 1549

   Most monastic hospitals were also closed, their residents being
   discharged with small pensions. Monasteries had also supplied free food
   and alms for the poor and destitute, and it has been argued that the
   removal of this and other charitable resources, amounting to about 5%
   of net monastic income, was one of the factors in the creation of the
   army of "sturdy beggars" that plagued late Tudor England, causing the
   social instability that led to the Edwardian and Elizabethan [214]Poor
   Laws. Monastic grammar schools and university colleges, by contrast,
   were commonly refounded with enhanced endowments, especially in
   connection to the newly re-established cathedral churches. Hospitals
   too were frequently to be re-endowed by private benefactors; and many
   new almshouses and charities were to be founded by the Elizabethan
   gentry and professional classes. Nevertheless, it has been estimated
   that only in 1580 did overall levels of charitable giving in England
   returned to those before the dissolution. On the eve of the overthrow,
   the various monasteries owned approximately 2,000,000 acres (just under
   8 100 km), over 16 percent of England, with tens of thousands of tenant
   farmers working those lands; some of whom had family ties to a
   particular monastery going back many generations.

   It has been argued that the suppression of the English monasteries and
   nunneries contributed as well to the spreading decline of that
   contemplative spirituality which once thrived in Europe, with the
   occasional exception found only in groups such as the [215]Society of
   Friends ("Quakers"). This may be set against the continuation in the
   retained and newly established cathedrals of the daily singing of the
   [216]Divine Office by choristers and vicars choral, now undertaken as
   public worship, which had not been the case before the dissolution. The
   deans and prebends of the six new cathedrals were overwhelmingly former
   heads of religious houses. The secularised former monks and friars
   commonly looked for re-employment as parish clergy; and consequently
   numbers of new ordinations dropped drastically in the ten years after
   the dissolution, and ceased almost entirely in the reign of Edward VI.
   It was only in 1549, after Edward came to the throne, that former monks
   and nuns were permitted to marry; but within a year of the permission
   being granted around a quarter had done so, only to find themselves
   forcibly separated (and denied their pensions) in the reign of Mary. On
   the succession of Elizabeth, these former monks (happily reunited with
   both their wives and their pensions) formed the backbone of the new
   Anglican church, and may properly claim much credit for maintaining the
   religious life of the country until a new generation of ordinands
   became available in the 1560s and 1570s.

   Although it had been promised that King's enhanced wealth would enable
   the founding or enhanced endowment of religious, charitable and
   educational institutions, in practice only about 15% of the total
   monastic wealth was reused for these purposes. This comprised: the
   refoundation of eight out of nine former monastic cathedrals
   ([217]Coventry being the exception), together with six wholly new
   bishoprics ([218]Bristol, [219]Chester, [220]Gloucester, [221]Oxford,
   [222]Peterborough, [223]Westminster) with their associated cathedrals,
   chapters, choirs and grammar schools; the refoundation as secular
   colleges of monastic houses in [224]Brecon, [225]Thornton and
   [226]Burton on Trent, the endowment of the [227]Regius Professorships
   in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the endowment of the
   colleges of [228]Trinity College, Cambridge, and [229]Christ Church,
   Oxford and the maritime charity of [230]Trinity House. About a third of
   total monastic income was required to maintain pension payments to
   former monks and nuns, and hence remained with the Court of
   Augmentations. This left just over half to be available to be sold at
   market rates (very little property was given away by Henry to favoured
   servants, and any that was tended to revert to the Crown once their
   recipients fell out of favour, and were indicted for treason). By
   comparison with the forcible closure of monasteries elsewhere in
   Protestant Europe, the English and Welsh dissolutions resulted in a
   relatively modest volume of new religious endowments; but the treatment
   of former monks and nuns was more generous, and there was no
   counterpart elsewhere to the efficient mechanisms established in
   England to maintain pension payments over successive decades.

   The dissolution and destruction of the monasteries and shrines was very
   unpopular in many areas. In the north of England, centring on
   [231]Yorkshire and [232]Lincolnshire, the suppression of the
   monasteries led to a popular rising, the [233]Pilgrimage of Grace, that
   threatened the Crown for some weeks. In 1536 there were major, popular
   uprisings in [234]Lincolnshire and [235]Yorkshire and a further rising
   in [236]Norfolk the following year. Rumours were spread that the King
   was going to strip the parish churches too, and even tax cattle and
   sheep. The rebels called for an end to the dissolution of the
   monasteries, for the removal of [237]Cromwell, and for Henry's
   daughter, and eldest child, the [238]Catholic [239]Mary to be named as
   successor in place of his younger son, [240]Edward. Henry defused the
   movement with solemn promises, all of which went unkept, and then
   summarily executed the leaders.

   However, when [241]Mary succeeded to the throne in 1553, her hopes for
   a revival of English religious life proved a failure. [242]Westminster
   Abbey, which had been retained as a cathedral, briefly reverted to
   being a monastery, but Mary found it very difficult to persuade former
   monks and nuns to enter her proposed revived foundations, and was
   compelled to import professed religious from [243]Spain. In spite of
   much prompting, none of Mary's lay supporters would co-operate in
   returning their holdings of monastic lands to religious use; while the
   lay lords in Parliament proved unremittingly hostile, as a revival of
   the "mitred" abbeys would have returned the House of Lords to having an
   ecclesiastical majority. In less than 20 years, the monastic impulse
   had effectively been extinguished in England; and was only revived,
   even amongst Catholics, in the very different form of the new and
   reformed [244]Counter-reformation orders, such as the [245]Jesuits.
