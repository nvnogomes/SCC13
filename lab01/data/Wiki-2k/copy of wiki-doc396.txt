   The Dreil are a fictional alien species that appear in the game
   [29]Dark Planet.[30][1]

   The Dreil are an ancient race whose origins have long been forgotten by
   the race itself something that does not concern the species much as
   they travel the stars in order to propagate their kind. In their wake,
   thousands of worlds, which were once inhabited planets, became barren
   husks of their former selves.[31][2]

   The Dreil Hive itself consists of thousands of voracious creatures who
   follow a swarm-like intelligence with no concern over the death of a
   single member of their kind. The race is mindlessly efficient in its
   goal with many workers, soldiers and other specialized castes being
   developed by the race. Their 'specialization' can make certain castes
   appear as completely different species but they are all unified in
   their purpoe by the telepathic will of the Dreil Queen.

   The Dreil Queens are the guiding intelligence of the race who are
   powerful psychics that are so strong that it allows them to sense the
   echoes of life from neighbouring solar systems. Once they have taken
   hold on a world, they mentally guide their armies who consume all
   organic living matter on the world. This results in those colonies
   infected by the race to be sucked dry of all life. Once this is done,
   the Dreil focus their efforts in producing a massive powerful egg
   launcher. Then the hive colony simply dies as part of their natural
   lifespan with the death of the Dreil Queen resulting in an eggship,
   with her embryoes, being launched into space to a life bearing world
   that was sensed earlier.

   Thus, the Dreil life cycle continues with worlds being destroyed in
   their wake to feed their insatiable appetites with a new world being
   infested by the race. Within the game, a seed from a Dreil colony has
   landed on the world of [32]Natrolis and must compete with the two
   species of the world, the native [33]Sorin and the Terrans.
