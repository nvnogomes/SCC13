   Denis, [33]Portuguese: Dinis or Diniz, pronounced [34][dini]
   ([35]Lisbon, [36]9 October [37]1261 [38]7 January [39]1325 in
   [40]Santarm), called the Farmer King (Rei Lavrador), was the sixth
   [41]King of Portugal and the Algarve. The eldest son of [42]Afonso III
   of Portugal by his second wife, [43]Beatrice of Castile, Dinis
   succeeded his father in 1279.

   As heir to the throne [44]Infante Dinis was summoned by his father
   ([45]Afonso III) to share government responsibilities. At the time of
   his accession to the throne, Portugal was again in diplomatic conflicts
   with the [46]Catholic church. Dinis signed a favouring agreement with
   the pope and swore to protect the Church's interests in Portugal. He
   granted asylum to [47]Templar knights persecuted in [48]France and
   created the [49]Order of Christ, designed to be a continuation of the
   Order of the Temple.

   With the [50]Reconquista completed and the Portuguese territory freed
   from [51]Moorish occupation, Dinis was essentially an administrative
   king, not a military one. However, a short war between [52]Castile and
   Portugal broke during his reign, for the possession of the town of
   Serpa and Moura. After this, Dinis avoided war: he was a notably
   peace-loving monarch during a tempestuous time in European history.
   With Portugal finally recognized as an independent country by his
   neighbours, Dinis signed a border pact with [53]Ferdinand IV of Castile
   (1297) which has endured to the present day.

   Dinis' main priority of government was the organization of the country.
   He pursued his father's policies on legislation and centralization of
   power. Dinis promulgated the nucleus of a Portuguese civil and criminal
   law code, protecting the lower classes from abuse and extortion. As
   king, he travelled around the country, correcting unjust situations and
   resolving problems. He ordered the construction of numerous castles,
   created new towns, and granted privileges due cities to several others.
   With his wife, [54]Infanta Isabella of Aragon, Dinis worked to improve
   the life of the poor and founded several social institutions.

   Always concerned with the country's infrastructure, Dinis ordered the
   exploration of mines of [55]copper, [56]silver, [57]tin and [58]iron
   and organized the export of excess production to other European
   countries. The first Portuguese commercial agreement was signed with
   [59]England in 1308. Dinis effectively founded the Portuguese navy
   under command of a Genoese admiral and ordered the construction of
   several docks.

   His main concern was the redevelopment and promotion of rural
   infrastructure, hence the nickname of "the Farmer". Dinis redistributed
   the land, promoted agriculture, organized communities of farmers and
   took personal interest in the development of exports. He instituted
   regular markets in a number of towns and regulated their activities.
   One of his main achievements was the protection of agricultural lands
   from advancing coastal sands, by ordering the planting of a pine forest
   near [60]Leiria. This forest still exists as one of the most important
   of Portugal and is known as the Pinhal de Leiria (Leiria Pinewood).

   Culture was another interest of King Dinis. He had a fondness for
   literature and wrote several books himself, with topics ranging from
   administration to hunting, science and poetry. In his days, [61]Lisbon
   was one of Europe's centers of culture and knowledge. The University of
   Lisbon (today's [62]University of Coimbra) was founded by his decree
   Magna Charta Priveligiorum. He was also a great poet and
   [63]troubadour. His poems and songs are preserved in mediaeval
   manuscripts of the [64]Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, the
   Cancioneiro da Vaticana and the [65]Pergaminho Sharrer, the latter
   comprising seven songs by King Dinis with [66]musical notation.

   The latest part of his peaceful reign was nevertheless marked by
   internal conflicts. The contenders were his two sons: [67]Afonso the
   legitimate heir, and Afonso Sanches his natural son, who quarrelled
   frequently among themselves for royal favour. At the time of Dinis
   death in 1325 he had placed [68]Portugal on an equal footing with the
   other Iberian Kingdoms.

   Dinis is buried in the [69]Monastery of Saint Denis of Odivelas, a
   [70]Cistercian monastery founded by him in 1295.
