[[36]edit] Location

   Durham, Ontario is 44 kilometers South of [37]Owen Sound and 65
   kilometers North of [38]Guelph on Ontario [39]Highway 6. The middle of
   the town is the intersection of Highway 6 and Grey Road 4. Durham is
   approximately 18 kilometers East of [40]Hanover.

   The population of Durham has stayed steady at roughly 2500 people over
   the past decade. This compares to neighbour Hanover which has grown
   from 6400 to 8200 people in the past decade.

   Durham is built around the [41]Saugeen River and has three manmade
   dams. These dams have suffered at least two major floods, once in 1929
   when the dam broke and again in 1997 due to ice blockage. Durham also
   used to be the center of the livestock exchange for the surrounding
   Grey and [42]Bruce counties, which it lays close to the border of. On
   the outskirts of Durham, there are several small communities, such as
   [43]Varney, [44]Dornoch, [45]Aberdeen, [46]Allan Park, [47]Priceville
   and [48]Holstein.

[[49]edit] Foundations of Durham

   Founded on [50]May 1, [51]1842 by Archibald Hunter, a [52]Scottish
   traveller, Durham became one of the first ever self-sustaining
   communities in Canada through the flour and saw mills of an
   [53]Irishman named John Edge, founded in the 1840s. Those mills were
   purchased by Robert McGowan in 1888, hence the Durham landmark McGowan
   Falls on the Saugeen River. Durham now has two major companies for
   employment: Durham Furniture and Interforest. Durham Furniture is a
   company that specializes in [54]stained and [55]whitewashed bedroom
   furniture and employs slightly more than 600 people. Interforest is a
   [56]multinational corporation that deals with the treatment and
   production of [57]lumber.

   Durham has its own [58]hospital with limited emergency facilities,
   although it was once a full blown community hospital equipped to handle
   most situations. The town is patrolled by the municipality's [59]West
   Grey [60]Police, and the town does have its own police station. Also,
   Durham has its own volunteer [61]firefighter service and station. The
   town has its own [62]Canada Post building, as well as a town hall. The
   town also has a [63]Conservation Area with camp sites that are very
   popular during the summertime and help expand local business.

          Text from the Founding of Durham Plaque:

          In 1842 Archibald Hunter, a Scottish immigrant, led a party
          northward on the Garafraxa "colonization road" to the banks of
          the Saugeen River. The resulting settlement was first called
          Bentinck and later Durham, probably to honour the English
          birthplace of [64]George Jackson, the first local Crown Land
          Agent. The establishment of flour and grist-mills in 1847 made
          the town the major agricultural centre of the district. The
          Durham Road, another settlement route , was constructed through
          the town in 1849. Further growth followed, churches were
          founded, a school organized, and a newspaper, the Chronicle, was
          established in 1857. By an Act passed in 1872, the Ontario
          legislature incorporated Durham as a town. [65][1]

[[66]edit] Community centres

   Knox United Church and the Durham Library

   Durham presently has two schools: Spruce Ridge [67]Community School and
   [68]St. Peter and [69]St. Paul's [70]Catholic School. Spruce Ridge is
   the result of the amalgamation of the Saugeen Valley Community School
   and Durham District Community School. Durham District used to be the
   town's [71]high school until the 1970s when it amalgamated with
   [72]Hanover's high school to form [73]John Diefenbaker [74]Secondary
   School. Students that graduate from SRCS generally attend Grey
   Highlands [75]Secondary School in [76]Flesherton or JDSS in Hanover.
   Durham has an arena that can hold 3000 people and also has an [77]art
   gallery. The town hosts an annual fall fair that attracts many
   visitors. There is a [78]public library and a couple of small
   bookshops. Durham is the home of [79]Branch 308 of the [80]Royal
   Canadian Legion and multiple [81]churches for the variety of
   denominations. The Durham [82]Agricultural Society was founded in 1858.
   The Durham Loyal [83]Orange Lodge has existed in Durham since the
   1850s. The Durham [84]Horticultural Society dates back to at least
   1896. Durham's [85]Masonic Lodge was chartered in 1873. [86]Girl Guides
   have been presented since two years after its [87]Canadian founding,
   1912. The first [88]Rotary Club meeting held in Durham was on
   [89]February 17, [90]1938. The [91]Kinsmen Club was founded [92]May 30,
   [93]1950 and the [94]Kinette Club was founded [95]March 28, [96]1957.
   [97]Boy Scouts in Durham date back to the 1920s. The Durham & District
   [98]Optimist Club was chartered [99]June 14, [100]1988.

   As of the town census in 1861, Durham had 4 churches: the Free Church
   [101]Presbyterian, the [102]Church of England, the [103]Wesleyan
   Methodist, and the [104]Baptist [105]Church. Durham has always had a
   cornucopia of churches, even to this day the town is scattered with
   beautiful old buildings of faith. The Durham Baptist Church was founded
   by [106]Reverend Alexander Stewart, and dates back to the mid-19th
   century. In 1902, the frame of the church was moved and a new large red
   brick church was built as its replacement. This building is detailed
   with beautiful [107]stained glass windows. The Durham [108]Foursquare
   Gospel Church was founded in 1929 in a tent. A year later, in 1930, the
   Church took up permanent residence on the town's main street. The
   Durham Presbyterian Church was founded in the early 1850s. The
   Presbyterian Church was granted 10 acres (40,000 m^2) of land by the
   Crown in 1852. In 1925, the Presbyterian, Methodist, and Congregational
   faiths were combined to form the [109]United Church. In Durham, only
   some Presbyterian and Methodist Churches followed this order, but the
   merger did lead to the formation of the [110]Knox United Church on top
   of the Durham Hill. The earliest known Methodist service was help in
   1849. The Methodist Church was erected in the mid-1860s. The Methodist
   Church joined the [111]Knox [112]United Church in 1925. The first
   [113]Anglican service happened in 1849. The [114]Trinity Anglican
   Church dates back to around that time and burnt down in 1876. The
   church was rebuilt in 1877 and still stands there today despite
   multiple [115]lightning strikes. [116]Catholic services in Durham date
   back to 1852, the first being held by [117]Jesuit [118]Missionary
   Reverend Casper Matoga. The first [119]Catholic Church was built in
   Durham 1867 but was burnt down by an arsonist on [120]July 4,
   [121]1870. A second Catholic Church was purchased for $900 in 1892. The
   Church's main hall, known at [122]St. Andrew's Hall was used as their
   place of worship until the 1940s. In 1940, [123]St. Peter's [124]Roman
   Catholic Church was created on top of the Durham Hill, right beside the
   St. Peter and St. Paul's Catholic School. The Fellowship Baptist Church
   was founded in 1990. There is also a [125]Jehovah's Witness Church to
   the West of Durham on Grey Road 4.

[[141]edit] Sports in Durham

   During the 1850s and 1860s Durham athletes constantly travelled to
   neighboring towns like [142]Mount Forest to compete in [143]Curling
   matches during the winter and [144]Cricket matches during the hot
   [145]Southern Ontario summers. The local Cricket league in the 1860s
   included, with Durham and Mount Forest, [146]Owen Sound, [147]Chesley,
   [148]Walkerton, and [149]Listowel. In 1882, [150]Harriston and
   [151]Dundalk joined the local league. For 40 years, Durham maintained a
   Junior, Senior, and School league team. By the 1910s, Cricket dropped
   in popularity and was no longer consistently played by the people of
   Durham. [152]Soccer, then known as Football, became popular in the late
   1870s but was replaced by [153]Lacrosse in the 1890s. The Town of
   Durham enjoyed sports so much that at the turn of the 19th century,
   Durham used to dedicate 3 days per year to day-long displays of
   athletics. These days usually involved Soccer, Lacrosse, Cricket, and
   [154]Baseball games, from Dawn until Dusk, to be played for the
   townspeople.

   In 1908, the first ever indoor ice arena was built by Thomas Brown to
   facilitate the towns growing fascination with the sport of [155]Hockey.
   At least two outdoor arenas had been built in recent years, but this
   was meant to be a permanent replacement. The first hockey game was
   played in the arena on [156]January 1, [157]1909. A new arena was built
   in 1952 through fundraising by the Kinsman Club, the Rotary Club, and
   Branch 308 of the Royal Canadian Legion. Hap McGirr was the Guardian of
   this arena until 1974. This arena was condemned in 1975 and the current
   complex finished construction in 1977.
   Durham Jr. "A" Huskies (circa 1998)

   Durham considers itself a [158]hockey town, and for the most-part it is
   true. Hockey is the most popular pastime and normally draws over 250
   children and teens into its Minor Hockey system. Durham has won a
   number of All-Ontario Championships. The town's parent club under minor
   hockey guidelines is the Grey-Bruce Highlanders AAA Hockey Team. Durham
   hockey was first organized in the early 1900s by Frank Irwin and Peter
   Gagnon. Erben Schutz and [159]Martin Lauder found early success through
   Durham hockey, playing in the 1920s for the [160]NHL's [161]Boston
   Bruins. The town won its first major hockey award in the 1930-31 season
   as one of the precursors to the [162]Durham Huskies won the Junior
   Northern Hockey League. Durham's first Ontario Hockey Association
   Senior championship happened in 1935-36, won by another precursor to
   the [163]Durham Huskies. In fact, the [164]Huskies (before they were
   called the Huskies) were 3 different hockey teams: a Junior team, an
   Intermediate team, and a Senior team. By 1952, the year the team was
   named there was only an Intermediate team, but they were quite dominant
   in their league. Intermediate hockey eventually became known as Senior
   "AA". The Senior team was extremely successful, winning multiple
   championships and competing for [165]Allan and Hardy Cups, but folded
   before the 1992-93 season. The [166]Durham Flyers were a short lived
   team in the 1950s, but did not find much success in their 3 years of
   existence. In 1996, Durham was granted the creation of the [167]Durham
   Huskies Junior "A" Hockey Team by the [168]Metro Junior A Hockey
   League. The [169]Jr. Huskies folded in 2001. The ever-successful
   [170]Durham Thundercats Senior Hockey Team have brought the town 15
   [171]WOAA championship trophies and remain at the top of the WOAA to
   this day. They were originally called the "72's" to coincide with their
   founding and fill the Durham Community Centre every Friday night.

   The Durham Community Centre is also the home of The Durham Skating
   Club, Which was founded in the 1950s. The club offers a variety of
   programs for the young and old, with a friendly, fun atmosphere. An
   annual carnival is produced each year at the end of the season to
   showcase all of the skaters' talent and to attract a crowd of huge
   proportions. In January 2007 the club hosted Weskate, an annual area
   fun competition, which was also highly successful, thanks to all the
   volunteers and organizers.

   Durham has [172]soccer and [173]baseball youth programs and competes in
   the local leagues. Most of Durham's soccer is played across from the
   Durham Community Centre at the Durham Soccer Field. Baseball is played
   outdoors behind the Durham Community Centre in the Durham Ball Parks.
   Durham youths still enjoy playing [174]lacrosse, but the sport has not
   been organized in Durham for many decades. Generally, players have to
   travel to [175]Williamsford or Owen Sound to play lacrosse. The Durham
   [176]Curling Rink is on the East end of town beside what was the
   Saugeen Valley [177]Community School, and has been a long enjoyed
   pastime for the people of Durham.

[[182]edit] Current events

   On [183]January 9, [184]1997, Mayor Kris Kennedy declared a [185]state
   of emergency and asked for federal assistance to deal with extensive
   flooding that was crippling the west end of town. [186]Canadian Forces
   were sent in for the relief effort and 200 citizens were evacuated. The
   schools and many businesses closed during the most dangerous week of
   flooding, and due to poor weather conditions, relief efforts were
   considered strenuous. Most of the evacuated residents were able to
   return home as of [187]January 24, [188]1997. The cause of the flooding
   was determined to be ice blockages at Durham's reinforced dams. At one
   point, there was concern that one of the main bridges in town was going
   to get ripped away by the flood, but the military elected to remove the
   ice that was affecting the bridge with explosives. [189]3

     "Despite the adversity, the people of Durham showed great courage
     during that flood. I want to pay special tribute to the volunteers
     and the relief workers who offered the victims both the good work of
     their hands and the comfort of their spirits. Durham Mayor Kris
     Kennedy is also to be commended for taking swift and decisive action
     to protect public safety. I also want to thank the soldiers from the
     Militia Training and Support Centre at [190]Meaford for their work
     and assistance." [191]4

                      - Rt Hon. [192]Ovid Jackson [193]MP on [194]February
                      3, [195]1997

   Durham was named the 1997 "Best Bloomin' Town" in Canada by the
   [196]Communities in Bloom Committee. The town won the prize in the 1500
   to 5000 people category.

   As part of provincewide municipal restructuring, the Town of Durham was
   amalgamated with the Township of West Grey to form an expanded
   Municipality of West Grey in 2001. West Grey was itself created in 2000
   through an amalgamation of the Village of [197]Neustadt and the
   Townships of Bentinck, Glenelg and Normanby. [198]Mayor Kris Kennedy
   ([199]list of Durham's Mayors) was the last mayor of the Town of
   Durham. Durham is the largest community in West Grey and the municipal
   offices are located along Grey County Road 4 west of the community.

   Durham's long running newspaper, "The Durham Chronicle" came under the
   ownership of [200]Osprey Media. It and a number of other newspapers in
   south Grey were amalgamated into one free distribution paper called the
   Post. Other recent changes include the replacement of the Durham
   District Community School by the Spruce Ridge Community School. The
   Durham Huskies, the town's traditional hockey franchise, have also been
   inactive since 2001.
