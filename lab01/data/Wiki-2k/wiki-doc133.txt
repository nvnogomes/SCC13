[[27]edit] Early life

   The Gilardi family of architects, originally from [28]Ticino,^[29][1]
   established itself in Russia in the middle of [30]XVIII century.
   Domenicos father Giovanni, also known as Ivan Dementievich, was well
   known in Moscow. Domenico was born in [31]Montagnola and lived there
   until his mother brought him to Russia in 1796.^[32][2]

   Domenico longed for a career in painting, so in 1799, his father sent
   him to an Italian workshop in [33]St.Petersburg. After the death of
   [34]Paul I, dowager Empress [35]Maria Feodorovna awarded him a
   scholarship, and eventually a state-financed study tour to Italy. From
   1803-1810 Domenico studied art in [36]Milano, [37]Florence, [38]Venice
   and [39]Rome.

   Domenico returned to Russia in June 1810, and in January 1811 joined
   his father, who was the architect of the enormous [40]Moscow Orphanage
   ([41]Russian: , Foundling House). The first two stages of this enormous
   structure, conceived by educator [42]Ivan Betzkoy, were completed in
   1764-1781 and required continuous additions and improvements. Domenico
   remained in the employ of the Orphanage for the rest of his career.

[[43]edit] Professional career

   In 1812, after the [44]Battle of Borodino, Gilardis fled Moscow. The
   city burnt down in September 1812; the disaster created a wealth of
   opportunity for architects. In 1813, Domenico joined the Kremlin
   Building Commission, restoring [45]Ivan the Great Bell Tower and other
   war losses. In 1817, his father retired and returned to Ticino;
   Domenico inherited his job as lead architect of The Orphanage.
   Gagarin House, 25 [46]Povarskaya Street, Moscow

   In 1817-1819 he completed his first independent job, reconstruction of
   [47]Matvei Kazakovs [48]University in Mokhovaya Street. Giliardi
   retained the basic floorplan, but considerably changed exterior
   styling. In 1818, he also received commissions to rebuild the Widows
   House ( ) and Catherines Institute ( ). In a very short time, Giliardi
   concentrated the efforts to restore the four largest public buildings
   in the city, with the aid of [49]Afanasy Grigoriev, a recently
   emancipated serf architect.
   Riding Court, Kuzminki Park (now within Moscow limits)

   Gilardi's style goes back to the Milano variety of Empire Classicism,
   [50]Luigi Cagnola and in particular [51]Antonio Antolini's Bonaparte
   Forum.^[52][3] Grigoriev later followed the same canon. Gilardi's
   architectural talent is disputed, but his success in construction
   management and ability to lead concurrent major projects is
   unquestionable.

   His first work in new construction was the Board of Trustees building,
   a new block on the Orphanage lot (Solyanka Street, now Academy of
   Medical Science). It was followed by private commissions from the
   [53]Gagarin (Povarskaya street) and [54]Golitsyn ([55]Kuzminki Estate,
   1820-1832) families. In 1826-1832, Gilardi supervised the rebuilding of
   Slobodskoy Palace in [56]Lefortovo, a subsidiary of the Orphanage.
   Grigoriev replaced his when Gilardi travelled to Europe and back.

   After less than twenty years of active practice, Gilardi retired and
   left for Switzerland in 1832. Back home, he completed only one project
   a chapel near Montagnola.

   Giliardi's students and junior partners continued work in Moscow:
     * [57]Afanasy Grigoriev (17821868)
     * [58]Alessandro Gilardi (1808-1871)
     * [59]Yevgraph Tyurin (1792-1870)
