Eddington luminosity

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Edington limit)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   The Eddington luminosity (also referred to as the Eddington limit) in a
   star is defined as the point where the gravitational force inwards
   equals the continuum radiation force outwards, assuming [9]hydrostatic
   equilibrium and spherical symmetry. When exceeding the Eddington
   luminosity, a star would initiate a very intense continuum driven
   [10]stellar wind from its outer layers. Since most massive stars have
   luminosities far below the Eddington luminosity, however, their winds
   are mostly driven by the less intense line absorption. ^[11][1]

   Originally, Sir [12]Arthur Stanley Eddington only took the electron
   scattering into account when calculating this limit, something that now
   is called the classical Eddington limit. Nowadays, the modified
   Eddington limit also counts on other continuum processes such as
   bound-free and free-free interaction.

[[18]edit] Derivation

   The limit is obtained by setting the outward continuum radiation
   pressure equal to the inward gravitational force. Both forces decrease
   by inverse square laws, so once equality is reached, the hydrodynamic
   flow is different throughout the star.

   The pressure support of a star is given by the equation of
   [19]hydrostatic equilibrium:

          \frac{dP}{dr} = - \rho g = -G \frac{M \rho}{r^2}

   The outward force of radiation pressure is given by:

          \frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{\kappa \rho}{c}F_{rad} =-\frac{\sigma_T
          \rho}{m_p c} \frac{L}{4\pi r^2}

   where [T] is the [20]Thomson scattering cross-section for the
   [21]electron and the gas is assumed to be purely made of ionized
   hydrogen. is the opacity of the stellar material.

   Equating these two pressures and solving for the luminosity gives the
   Eddington Luminosity:

          \begin{align}L_{\rm Edd}&=\frac{4\pi G M m_{\rm p} c}
          {\sigma_{\rm T}}\\ &\cong
          1.3\times10^{31}\left(\frac{M}{M_\bigodot}\right){\rm W} =
          3.3\times10^4\left(\frac{M}{M_\bigodot}\right) L_\bigodot
          \end{align}

   where M is the mass of the central object, M[] the mass and L[] the
   luminosity of the [22]Sun, m[p] the mass of a proton and [T] the
   Thomson cross-section for the electron.

   The mass of the proton appears because, in the typical environment for
   the outer layers of a star, the radiation pressure acts on electrons,
   which are driven away from the center. Because protons are negligibly
   pressured by the analog of Thomson scattering, due to their larger
   mass, the result is to create a slight charge separation and therefore
   a radially directed electric field, acting to lift the positive
   charges, which are typically free protons under the conditions in
   stellar atmospheres. When the outward electric field is sufficient to
   levitate the protons against gravity, both electrons and protons are
   expelled together.

   Thus in certain circumstances the balance can be different than it is
   for hydrogen. For example, in an evolved star with a pure [23]helium
   atmosphere, the electric field would have to lift a helium nucleus (an
   [24]alpha particle), with nearly four times the mass of a proton, while
   the radiation pressure would act on two free electrons. Thus twice the
   usual Eddington luminosity would be needed to drive off an atmosphere
   of pure He. On the other hand, at very high temperatures, as in the
   environment of a [25]black hole or [26]neutron star, high energy photon
   interactions with nuclei or even with other photons, can create an
   electron-positron plasma. In that situation the mass of the
   neutralizing positive charge carriers is ~1836 times smaller (the
   proton:electron mass ratio), while the radiation pressure on the
   positrons doubles the effective upward force per unit mass, so the
   limiting luminosity needed is reduced by a factor of ~2*1836. Thus the
   exact value of the Eddington luminosity depends on the chemical
   composition of the gas layer and the spectral energy distribution of
   the emission. Gas with cosmological abundances of hydrogen and helium
   is much more transparent than gas with [27]solar abundance ratios.
   Atomic line transitions can greatly increase the effects of radiation
   pressure, and line driven winds exist in some bright stars.

[[28]edit] Super-Eddington luminosities

   The role of the Eddington limit in todays research lies in explaining
   the very high mass loss rates seen in for example the series of
   outbursts of [29]Carinae in 1840-1860. ^[30][2] The regular, line
   driven stellar winds can only stand for a mass loss rate of around 10
   ^4 10 ^3 solar masses per year, whereas we need mass loss rates of up
   to 0.5 solar masses per year to understand the Carinae outbursts. This
   can be done with the help of the super-Eddington continuum driven
   winds.

   [31]Gamma-ray bursts, [32]novae and [33]supernovae are examples of
   systems exceeding their Eddington luminosity by a large factor for very
   short times, resulting in short and highly intensive mass loss rates.
   Some [34]X-ray binaries and [35]active galaxies are able to maintain
   luminosities close to the Eddington limit for very long times. For
   accretion powered sources such as accreting [36]neutron stars or
   [37]cataclysmic variables (accreting [38]white dwarfs), the limit may
   act to reduce or cut off the accretion flow, imposing an Eddington
   limit on accretion corresponding to that on luminosity. Super-Eddington
   accretion onto stellar-mass black holes is one possible model for
   ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs).

   For accreting [39]black holes, all the energy released by accretion
   does not have to appear as outgoing luminosity, since energy can be
   lost through the [40]event horizon, down the hole. Such sources
   effectively may not conserve energy. Then the accretion efficiency, or
   the fraction of energy actually radiated of that theoretically
   available from the gravitational energy release of accreting material,
   enters in an essential way.

[[41]edit] Other factors

   It is however also important to note that the Eddington limit is not a
   strict limit of the luminosity of a stellar object. Several potentially
   important factors have been left out, and a couple of super-Eddington
   objects have been observed that do not seem to have the high mass loss
   rate that we would expect. It is therefore of interest to also look at
   other possible factors that might affect the maximum luminosity of a
   star:

   Porosity. A problem with the idea of a steady, continuum driven winds
   lies in the fact that both the radiative flux and gravitational
   acceleration scale with r^-2. The ratio between the two factors would
   then be constant, and in a super-Eddington star, the whole envelope
   would become gravitationally unbound at the same time. This is not what
   is seen, and a possible solution is introducing an atmospheric
   porosity, where we imagine the stellar atmosphere to consist of denser
   regions surrounded by lower density gas regions. The result would be
   that the coupling between radiation and matter would be reduced, and
   the full force of the radiation field would only be seen in the outer
   lower density layers of the atmosphere that are more homogenous.

   Turbulence. A possible destabilizing factor might be the turbulent
   pressure arising when energy in the [42]convection zones builds up a
   field of supersonic turbulent motions. The importance of turbulence is
   being debated, however. ^[43][3]

   Photon bubbles. Another potentially important factor is the photon
   bubble effect that might give a good explanation to some stable
   super-Eddington objects. These photon bubbles would develop
   spontaneously in radiation-dominated atmospheres when the magnetic
   pressure exceeds the gas pressure. We can imagine a region in the
   stellar atmosphere with a density lower than the surroundings, but with
   a higher radiation pressure. The region would then rise through the
   atmosphere, with radiation diffusing in from the sides, leading to an
   even higher radiation pressure. This effect would be able to transport
   radiation more efficiently than a homogenous atmosphere, and the
   allowed total radiation rate would be a lot higher. In [44]accretion
   discs, we would be able to reach luminosities as high as 10-100 times
   the Eddington limit without experiencing the previously mentioned
   instabilities. ^[45][4]
