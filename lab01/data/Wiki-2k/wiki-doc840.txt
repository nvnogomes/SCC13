[[49]edit] History

   Please help [52]improve this section by adding citations to
   [53]reliable sources. [54]Unverifiable material may be challenged and
   removed. (March 2008)

   Although in use as ranch land, Edcouch was sparsely settled prior to
   the 1900s.

   During the early 1900s, land speculators began to buy up the land that
   was to become the Delta Area of the Lower [55]Rio Grande Valley of
   Texas. People from the northern part of the United States were invited
   to visit the area, and representatives of the land companies sold
   property to anyone who had the money to buy.

   People from all parts of the nation began moving south. [56]Mercedes,
   [57]Donna, and [58]Edinburg were small towns then, and the area now
   known as the Delta Area was, for the most part, unsettled. [59]Weslaco
   was a newer town, developed by the land company from which it derived
   its name.

   Among the first to settle the Delta area was R.R. Hill, who built a
   store on what is now known as Farm to Market Road 1015 and Mile 16-N,
   south of the current location of Edcouch. Not wanting to send his
   children 15 miles to Edinburg, Mr. Adolph Carlson donated a couple of
   acres of land at the corner of Mile 4-W and Mile 17-N for the purpose
   of building a school. Located at the current location of the
   Edcouch-Elsa High School, the Carlson School soon became a community
   center.

   Realizing that the railroad would be coming through the area, land
   promoters began lobbying for it to run through their property. Mr. Ed
   Couch, a Weslaco land promoter and banker, owned property north of Elsa
   on Mile 17-N. Hoping for the railroad to come to his property, he
   secured a right of way. Not to be outdone, Mr. William George worked to
   influence the railroad to go through his property north of Mile 16-N,
   the location of the new town of Elsa.

   Realizing that Mr. George was proving to have more influence in this
   matter, Mr. Couch made plans to build a town 2 miles east of Elsa, on
   property which he secured. The town of Edcouch was born. A Mr. Lackland
   opened a section of town east of what is now known as FM-1015, and
   began selling only to Latin Americans.

   Within a year, Edcouch had 2 feedstores, a box factory, 2 ice plants, 2
   lumber yards, 11 packing sheds, a theater, a furniture store, a funeral
   parlor, a variety store, 3 grocery stores, a real estate office, a
   telephone exchange, post office, bank, community center, jail,
   drugstore, cafe, barbershop, and even its own newspaper -- the Edcouch
   Enterprise.

   It was much bigger then than it is now. Over the years, hurricanes and
   fires have destroyed many of its businesses, its once bustling down
   town has deteriorated, at least half of its remaining buildings vacant.
   The railroad ceased operations a few years ago and the tracks
   themselves were removed in 2000. It is today a low-income bedroom
   community with a population of under 3,000.

   Boarded-up, underutilized, and irreparable commercial and residential
   buildings dominate the area. Large industrial canning and cotton
   facilities that long ago lost their luster dot the landscape. These are
   communities where Spanish is the language of commerce and the Catholic
   Church dominates the culture. Ninety-six percent of the population is
   Hispanic, and only Spanish is spoken in eight of every 10 households.

   Unemployment typically fluctuates between 20 and 32 percent, due to the
   seasonal nature of agricultural work. Other job options are limited.
   The result is a poverty rate of 46 percent, one of Texas highest.

   Fewer than 45 percent of Delta Region adults have graduated from high
   school or earned a GED, far below the national average of 80 percent.
   Only 6 percent have at least a bachelors degree. Because job
   opportunities are limited, residents who do complete college usually
   leave.

   The EdcouchElsa School District is the regions largest employer.
   Approximately 60 percent of households earn less than $25,000 annually,
   and median individual earnings run just under $11,000. More than 90
   percent of the students in the two school districts are eligible for
   free or reduced-price lunches. The median home value is $35,300.

   Texas rural population as a share of the state total fell between 2000
   and 2005, a trend that is expected to persist. Population in the Delta
   Region, by contrast, rose by 6,900, or 18 percent, over the same period
   and is expected to continue rising. Many area residents originally came
   from Mexico as migrant farmworkers.

   In recent years, the population has continued to grow as families
   reunite, [60]U.S.Mexico trade expands and the cost of living remains
   low. Many immigrant families move to this high-poverty area because
   land is relatively inexpensive, their extended families have
   established roots there, and educational opportunities and health care
   are better than whats available in their hometowns. Others come because
   they can earn a living in the shadows of rural America. These
   communities attract people who enjoy the benefits of a rural setting,
   have access to employment and services in the nearby McAllen metro
   area, and can obtain owner financing for homesimportant because credit
   and access to mainstream financial institutions are not always options.

   Investment and Development. The lack of an educated workforce and the
   regions isolation from major transportation links discourage business
   investment. The businesses that do exist are mostly small franchises in
   the fast-food and service industries. Indictments of public officials,
   political patronage and leadership instability are common, which causes
   distrust.

   A lack of cooperation between area communities, deficient water and
   sewer infrastructure, and the absence of standard zoning regulations
   and building review processes have also paralyzed progress. The four
   municipal governments face these obstacles with small tax bases. As a
   result, they are commonly seen as ineffective and unresponsive to
   residents basic needs.

   There is hope. With tremendous growth throughout the Lower Rio Grande
   Valley, we are seeing activity in the Edcouch area. New houses,
   apartment buildings, and even a few small businesses have emerged to
   fill the gaps between Edcouch and La Villa to its east, and Elsa to its
   west. There is room for additional growth to the north and south,
   although weve seen little of it. While it is doubtful that Edcouch will
   regain the industry and vigor it enjoyed in the 1920s and 1930s, there
   is little doubt that it will surpass its earlier population counts. The
   estimated population of Edcouch as of January 1, 2002 was 3,604.

   The Rio Grande Valley Empowerment Zone, a 10-year program that ended in
   2004, allocated over $40 million and attracted over $365 million in
   other funding for small business development, utility infrastructure
   and educational initiatives in South Texas. The Delta Region received
   nearly $5 million in RGVEZ grants and loans and another $13 million
   from other federal, state and local sources.

   In late 2004, a group of local business owners, civic leaders and
   others released a blueprint for the future that builds on the
   empowerment zones momentum. The plan sets out five goals: (1) expand
   education and health care training facilities; (2) construct
   distribution centers for nearby major trade routes; (3) grow and sell
   specialty foods; (4) build on the ecotourism and hunting industries;
   and (5) capitalize on residents Spanish-language skills and friendly
   demeanor to attract more call center business.

   Today, the Delta Region points to a market-style center, Mercado Delta,
   as a symbol of its ability to progress. Still under development, this
   indooroutdoor facility will be anchored by Valley microbusinesses and
   provide retail space to local enterprises that sell locally grown
   produce, arts and crafts, gifts and other goods. Funded by a $500,000
   grant from the Economic Development Administration, the center taps
   into the areas entrepreneurial spirit. The hope is that the mercado
   will generate sustainable economic activity.
