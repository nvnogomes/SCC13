Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia or the dopamine hypothesis of
   psychosis is a model attributing symptoms of [8]schizophrenia (like
   [9]psychoses) to a disturbed and hyperactive dopaminergic [10]signal
   transduction. The model draws evidence from the observation that a
   large number of [11]antipsychotics have DA-antagonistic effects. The
   theory, however, does not posit [12]dopamine overabundance as a
   complete explanation for schizophrenia.

[[20]edit] Introduction

   Some researchers have suggested that dopamine systems in the
   [21]mesolimbic pathway may contribute to the 'positive symptoms' of
   schizophrenia (whereas problems with dopamine function in the
   [22]mesocortical pathway may be responsible for the 'negative
   symptoms', such as [23]avolition and [24]alogia.)

   Recent evidence on a variety of animal models of psychosis, such as
   sensitization of animal behaviour by [25]amphetamine, or
   [26]phencyclidine (Angel Dust), or excess [27]steroids, or by removing
   various genes ([28]COMT, [29]DBH, [30]GPRK6, [31]RGS9, [32]RIIbeta), or
   making brain lesions in newborn animals, or delivering animals
   abnormally by Caesarian section, all induce a marked behavioural
   supersensitivity to dopamine and a marked rise in the number of
   dopamine D[2] receptors in the high-affinity state for
   dopamine.^[33][1] This latter work implies that there are multiple
   genes and neuronal pathways that can lead to psychosis and that all
   these multiple psychosis pathways converge via the high-affinity state
   of the [34]D2 receptor, the common target for all antipsychotics,
   typical or atypical.

[[35]edit] Discussion

[[36]edit] Evidence for the dopamine hypothesis

   Some of the most obvious evidence for this theory is from the effect of
   drugs such as [37]amphetamine and [38]cocaine. These drugs (and others
   like them) increase levels of dopamine in the brain and can cause
   psychosis, particularly after large doses or prolonged use. This is
   often referred to as '[39]amphetamine psychosis' or 'cocaine
   psychosis', but may produce experiences virtually indistinguishable
   from the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. However, the
   acute effects of dopamine stimulants include euphoria, alertness and
   over-confidence; these symptoms are more reminiscent of mania than
   schizophrenia^[40][2]. In fact, extensive reviews by Lieberman^[41][3]
   and by Curran^[42][4] highlight the fact that up to 75% of patients
   with schizophrenia have increased signs and symptoms of their psychosis
   upon challenge with moderate doses of [43]methylphenidate or
   [44]amphetamine or other dopamine-like compounds, all given at doses at
   which control normal volunteers do not have any psychologically
   disturbing effects.

   Another important development was an accidental discovery that a group
   of drugs called the [45]phenothiazines, including [46]antipsychotics
   such as [47]chlorpromazine, [48]antagonized dopamine binding
   (particularly at [49]receptors known as D[2] [50]dopamine receptors)
   and reduced positive psychotic symptoms.

   This link was strengthened by experiments in 1970s which suggested that
   the affinity of antipsychotic drugs for the D[2] dopamine receptor
   family seemed to be inversely proportional to their therapeutic dose.
   This correlation between the therapeutic doses of antipsychotics and
   their affinities for the dopamine D2 receptor (then called the
   "antipsychotic/dopamine receptor") was reported by [51]Philip Seeman in
   1975^[52][5] and more recently in 2002.^[53][6]. There are no known
   exceptions to this correlation, as explained further below.

   More recent experimental studies have shown that amphetamine increases
   the level and intensity of psychotic symptoms in people who already
   have, or are liable to psychosis. Some [54]functional neuroimaging
   studies have also shown that, after taking amphetamine, patients
   diagnosed with schizophrenia show greater levels of dopamine release
   (particularly in the [55]striatum) than non-psychotic individuals.

   Concurrently, those treated with dopamine enhancing [56]Levodopa for
   [57]Parkinson's disease can experience psychotic side effects mimicking
   the symptoms of Schizophrenia.

   [58]Genetic evidence has suggested that there may be [59]genes, or
   specific variants of genes, that code for mechanisms involved in
   dopamine function, which may be more prevalent in people experiencing
   psychosis or diagnosed with schizophrenia. Dopamine related genes
   linked to psychosis in this way include [60]COMT, [61]DRD4,
   [62]AKT1.^[63][7]

[[64]edit] Evidence against the dopamine hypothesis

   Further experiments, conducted as new methods were developed
   (particularly the ability to use [65]PET scanning to examine drug
   action in the brain of living patients) challenged the view that the
   amount of dopamine blocking was correlated with clinical benefit. These
   studies showed that some patients had over 90% of their D[2] receptors
   blocked by antipsychotic drugs, but showed little reduction in their
   psychoses. This primarily occurs in patients who have had the psychosis
   for ten to thirty years. At least 90-95% of first-episode patients,
   however, respond to antipsychotics at low doses and do so with D2
   occupancy of 60-70%. The only antipsychotic that occupies high levels
   of D2 receptors over 90% is [66]aripiprazole, but this drug has both a
   D2-blocking component and a D2-stimulating component, and it is the
   D2-stimulating component that "internalizes" the D2 receptors in the
   nerve cells of patient, making it appear that there is more D2
   occupancy than is really necessary to do the job of antipsychotic
   action.

   Just as perplexing, although dopamine inhibiting medications modify
   dopamine levels within minutes, the associated improvement is usually
   not visible for at least several days ^[67][8], indicating that if
   nothing else, dopamine may not be directly responsible for the illness.

   Similarly, a new generation of antipsychotic drugs (called the
   [68]atypical antipsychotics) were found to be just as effective as
   older [69]typical antipsychotic drugs in controlling psychosis despite
   the fact that they blocked fewer dopamine receptors^[70][9]. More
   recent work, however, has shown that antipsychotic drugs such as
   clozapine and quetiapine are loosely bound to the dopamine D2 receptor.
   These drugs, therefore, come off the D2 receptors over a period of 6 to
   12 hours after ingestion, explaining why PET scanning finds these drugs
   to occupy somewhat lower levels of D2 receptors in patients. Earlier
   scanning of patients at about two hours after taking clozapine or
   quetiapine leads to the observation that their D2 receptors are
   occupied to the extent of 60% or 70%, the usual therapeutic level for
   all the antipsychotic drugs.^[71][10]

   The blockade of serotonin (5-HT2) receptors does not contribute either
   to the antipsychotic action or to alleviating the Parkinsonism that can
   occur at high doses of antipsychotic medication.^[72][11]

   The excitatory neurotransmitter [73]glutamate is now also thought to be
   associated with schizophrenia. [74]Phencyclidine (also known as PCP or
   'Angel Dust') and [75]ketamine, both of which block glutamate
   ([76]NMDA) receptors, are known to cause psychosis closely resembling
   schizophrenia, further suggesting that psychosis and schizophrenia
   cannot fully be explained in terms of dopamine function^[77][12].
   However, as reported in 2005 and mentioned above, the sensitization of
   animals with PCP markedly increases the animal's behavioural
   sensitivity to dopamine and markedly increases the number of
   high-affinity D2 receptors in the brain (Seeman et al., Proc. Nat.
   Acad. Sci., USA 102:3513-3518, 2005), implying that the multiple
   psychosis pathways converge through D2High, the main common target for
   antipsychotic medications.

   Similarly, there is now a great deal of evidence to suggest there may
   be a number of functional and structural anomalies in the brains of
   some people diagnosed with schizophrenia, such as changes in [78]grey
   matter density in the [79]frontal and [80]temporal lobes. Such changes
   or lesions or injuries, especially when done at an early age or in
   utero can lead to behavioural dopamine supersensitivity, as noted above
   (Seeman et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., USA 102:3513-3518, 2005). It
   appears, therefore, that there are multiple causes for psychosis and
   schizophrenia, including gene mutations, lesions, and drug abuse.

   Other evidence suggests that social and environmental factors are
   important in explaining how either schizophrenia, or specific episodes
   of psychosis, are triggered. This research has led people to argue that
   a purely biological explanation, without reference to social, cultural
   or environmental factors will never fully explain such phenomena. Such
   socio-economic-cultural factors can become highly stressful to certain
   individuals, such as immigrants, markedly altering their brain
   chemistry, including dopamine, and can be associated with increased
   risk to psychotic episodes.

   Psychiatrist [81]David Healy has argued that drug companies have
   inappropriately promoted the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia as a
   deliberate and calculated simplification for the benefit of drug
   marketing.
