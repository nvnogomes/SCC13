Dylan Ail Don

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Dylan (god))
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   Dylan Ail Don (Dylan Eil Ton, Dylan O'Taine, Dylan ElTon, Dylan Aldon,
   Dylan Ui Dan) is a character in the [9]Welsh mythic cycle the
   [10]Mabinogi of [11]Math fab Mathonwy. The story of Dylan reflects
   ancient [12]Celtic myths that were handed down orally for some
   generations before being written down during the early Christian period
   by clerics. The story as it has been preserved will therefore exhibit
   elements and archetypes characteristic of both [13]pagan and Christian
   mythologies.

[[25]edit] Biography

   In the tale it is told that Dylan's great uncle [26]Math ap Mathonwy
   would die if he did not keep his feet in the lap of a virgin when he
   was not at war. Math's original footholder Goewin is raped by
   Gilfaethwy who is punished severely when Math returns (Math turns him
   and [27]Gwydion into a series of mated pairs of animals). Math then
   marries Goewin to alleviate her shame, but must find a new virgin to
   hold his feet. Gwydion suggests his sister, Arianrhod.

[[28]edit] Dylan's Baptism

   One of the sons [29]Lleu Llaw Gyffes is born away as a "lump of flesh"
   and concealed in a chest until maturity, but the other was immediately
   forsaken by his mother yet was acknowledged by his great uncle Math and
   given the name Dylan Eil Ton upon baptism.

     And thereupon some small form was seen; but before any one could get
     a second glimpse of it, Gwydion had taken it, and had flung a scarf
     of velvet around it and hidden it. Now the place where he hid it was
     the bottom of a chest at the foot of his bed.^[30][1]'

   However, as soon as Dylan comes in contact with his baptismal waters,
   he plunges into the sea and takes on characteristics of a sea creature,
   moving through the seawater as perfectly as any fish, thus earning his
   epithet, Eil Ton the son of the wave:

     So they had the boy baptized, and as they baptized him he plunged
     into the sea. And immediately when he was in the sea, he took its
     nature, and swam as well as the best fish that was therein.^[31][1]'

[[32]edit] Dylan's Death

   Dylan is in the end accidentally killed by his uncle [33]Gofannon.

     And the blow whereby he came to his death, was struck by his uncle
     Govannon. The third fatal blow was it called'.^[34][1]

[[35]edit] Genealogy

   In the Mabinogion Dylan's mother Arianrhod appears the daughter of
   [36]Dn and the sister of [37]Gwydion and [38]Gilfaethwy. Her Uncle Math
   ap Mathonwy is the King of Gwynedd and during the course of the story
   Arianrhod gives birth to her two sons, Dylan Eil Ton and Lleu Llaw
   Gyffes, through magical means.

   In the [39]Welsh Triads Arianrhod, we are given a context for an actual
   Arianrhod who appears as the daughter of Beli Mawr^[40][2] and the
   sister of [41]Caswallawn (the historical Cassivellaunus).[1] Whether
   this reference is the result of the merging of a myth and history is
   unclear. It is possible that a later historic Arianrhod has become
   identified and merged with an earlier legendary/mythological Arianrhod.

[[42]edit] Literary Reference

   Dylan is the subject of a eulogy entitled [43]Marwnad Dylan Ail Don
   attributed to the [44]bard [45]Taliesin:

     One God Supreme, divine, the wisest, the greatest his habitation,
     when he came to the field, who charmed him in the hand of the
     extremely liberal.
     Or sooner than he, who was on peace on the nature of a turn.
     An opposing groom, poison made, a wrathful deed,
     Piercing Dylan a mischievous shore, violence freely flowing
     Wave of Iwerdon, and wave of Manau, and wave of the North,
     And wave of Prydain, hosts comely in fours.
     I will adore the Father God, the regulator of the country, without
     refusing.
     Creator in Heaven, may he admit us into merry.

[[46]edit] Mythological Elements

   In literature on Celtic mythology, the character Dylan is sometimes
   taken to be the vestige of an ancient Celtic god. According to this
   line of thinking, representation of Dylan in Welsh literature and in
   folklore have been used to infer the attributes of his supposed divine
   ancient Celtic prototype. Squire (2000:158) prefers to see in Dylan the
   remnants of a god of darkness:

     [T]wo sons were born at one birth Dylan and [47]Lleu, who are
     considered as representing the twin powers of darkness and light.
     With darkness the sea was inseparably connected by the [48]Celts,
     and, as soon as the dark twin was born and named, he plunged
     headlong into his native element...Beautiful legends grew up around
     his death. The clamour of the waves dashing upon the beach is the
     expression of their longing to avenge their son. The sound of the
     sea rushing up the mouth of the [49]River Conwy is still known as
     "Dylan's death-groan". A small promontory on the [50]Carnarvonshire
     side of the [51]Menai Strait, called [52]Pwynt Maen Tylen, or Pwynt
     Maen Dulan, preserves his name.

   On the other hand, MacCulloch (1911, Ch. VI) has preferred to see Dylan
   simply as the remnants of a local sea-god of [53]Gwynedd (North Wales):

     Dylan, however, has no dark traits and is described as a blonde. The
     waves lament his death, and, as they dash against the shore, seek to
     avenge it. His grave is "where the wave makes a sullen sound," but
     popular belief identifies him with the waves, and their noise as
     they press into the Conwy is his dying groan. Not only is he Eil
     Ton, "son of the wave," but also Eil Mor, "son of the sea." He is
     thus a local sea-god, and like [54]Manannan identified with the
     waves, and yet separate from them, since they mourn his death. The
     Mabinogi gives us the dbris of myths explaining how an
     anthropomorphic sea-god was connected with the goddess Arianrhod and
     slain by a god Govannon.

   In the Mabinogi accounts we can perceive the dbris of the following
   earlier [55]mythological prototypes:
     * [56]Category:Sea and river gods
     * [57]Category:Night gods
     * [58]Divine Twins
     * [59]Animagus [60]shapeshifting
     * [61]Natural Duality
     * [62]Anthropomorphism

[[63]edit] Etymology

   The etymology of the name Dylan is somewhat complex. In [64]Welsh,
   there is a bound item dylanw- which appears in dylanwad influence,
   dylanwadol influential and dylanwadu to influence [65][1] [66][2]. This
   element dylanw- appears itself to be a compound of the prefix dy- and
   the noun llanw tidal flow [67][3]. The prefix dy- appears in numerous
   words in [68]Welsh and is reconstructed in [69]Proto-Celtic as *d- with
   the meaning of off, away [70][4]. The item llanw is reconstructed in
   [71]Proto-Celtic as *lanwo- flood, filling. This *lanwo- may plausibly
   have had a reduced form *lanu- flood. This etymology is echoed in the
   following Gaelic (Irish) words:
     * [tuinne] nf. in : gob na tuinne, the water edge
     * [tn] nf. g. tine; d. tin; pl.+an, the fundament
     * [tonn] nm. g.v. tuinn; pl.+an and tuinn, wave, surge, billow

   Alone, the Welsh element dy can mean thy, thine or rather your
   (singular) but there is no gloss of this word meaning great, as the
   most cursory glance at the Welsh dictionary proves. [72][5] The name
   Dylan, then, can be maintained to be the descendant of a compound of
   [73]Proto-Celtic elements *d- lanu-s which together basically mean
   something in context relative to one of the following:

   The flood that recedes

   'The wave that floods'

   'The tide that returns'
