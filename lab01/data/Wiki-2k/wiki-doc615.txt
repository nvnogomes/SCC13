   Electronic Arts (EA) ([35]NASDAQ: [36]ERTS) is an international
   [37]developer, marketer, [38]publisher and distributor of [39]video
   games. Established in 1982 by [40]Trip Hawkins, the company was a
   pioneer of the early [41]home computer games industry and was notable
   for promoting the designers and programmers responsible for its games.
   Originally, EA was a home computing game publisher. In the late 1980s,
   the company began developing games in-house and supported consoles by
   the early 1990s. EA later grew via acquisition of several successful
   developers. By the early 2000s, EA had become one of the world's
   largest third-party publishers. Also partly developed by out of
   Cincinnati, Ohio by Drew Fischer. In 2007 EA ranked 8th on the list of
   largest software companies in the world.^[42][4] In May 2008, the
   company reported net annual revenue of [43]US$4.02 billion in fiscal
   year 2008.^[44][2] Currently, EA's most successful products are sports
   games published under its [45]EA Sports label, games based on popular
   movie licenses such as Harry Potter and games from long-running
   franchises like [46]Need for Speed, [47]Medal of Honor, [48]The Sims,
   [49]Battlefield and the later games in the [50]Burnout and [51]Command
   & Conquer series.

   Electronic Arts' original corporate logo, 19821999.

[[96]edit] 1982-1991

   In February 1982, Trip Hawkins arranged a meeting with [97]Don
   Valentine of [98]Sequoia Capital^[99][5] to discuss financing his new
   venture, Amazin' Software. Valentine encouraged Hawkins to leave
   [100]Apple Inc., in which Hawkins served as Director of Product
   Marketing, and allowed Hawkins use of [101]Sequoia Capital's spare
   office space to start the company. On 28 May 1982, Trip Hawkins
   incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of
   an estimated [102]US$200,000. Seven months later in December 1982,
   Hawkins secured US$2 million of [103]venture capital from [104]Sequoia
   Capital, [105]Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and [106]Sevin Rosen
   Funds.

   For more than seven months, Hawkins had refined his Electronic Arts
   [107]business plan. With aid from his first employee (with whom he
   worked in marketing at Apple), [108]Rich Melmon, the original plan was
   written, mostly by Hawkins, on an [109]Apple II in Sequoia Capital's
   office in August 1982. During that time, Hawkins also employed two of
   his former staff from Apple, [110]Dave Evans and [111]Pat Marriott, as
   [112]producers. The business plan was again refined in September and
   reissued on 8 October 1982.

   Between September and November, employee headcount rose to 11,
   including Tim Mott, [113]Bing Gordon, [114]David Maynard, and Steve
   Hayes. Having outgrown the office space provided by Sequoia Capital,
   the company relocated to a [115]San Mateo office that overlooked the
   [116]San Francisco Airport landing path. Headcount rose rapidly in
   1983, including [117]Don Daglow, [118]Richard Hilleman, Stewart Bonn,
   David Gardner, and Nancy Fong.

[[119]edit] Early sales strategy

   Hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers. Combined with the
   fact that Hawkins was pioneering new game brands, this made sales
   growth more challenging. Retailers wanted to buy known brands from
   existing distribution partners. Despite this, revenue was $5 million in
   the first year and $11 million the next.^[[120]citation needed] Former
   CEO [121]Larry Probst arrived as VP of Sales in late 1984 and helped
   the company sustain growth into $18 million in its third full year.
   Teaming with the existing sales staff that included [122]Nancy Smith,
   David Klein, and David Gardner, Probst built the largest sales force of
   any American game publisher.^[[123]citation needed] This policy of
   dealing directly with retailers gave EA higher margins and better
   market awareness, key advantages the company would leverage to leapfrog
   its early competitors.

   In December 1986 David Gardner and Mark Lewis moved to the UK to open a
   European headquarters. Up until that point publishing of Electronic
   Arts Games, and the conversion of many of their games to [124]compact
   cassette versions in Europe was handled by [125]Ariolasoft. A small
   company in [126]Wales was already called Electronic Arts, and until
   1997 Electronic Arts in the UK was known legally as EOA, a name derived
   from its square/circle/triangle logo. The Welsh company ceased trading
   in 1997 and Electronic Arts acquired the rights to the
   name.^[[127]citation needed]

[[128]edit] Name change

   Most of the early employees of the company disliked the Amazin'
   Software name that Hawkins had originally chosen when he incorporated
   the company.^[[129]citation needed] While at Apple, Hawkins had enjoyed
   company offsite meetings at [130]Pajaro Dunes and organized such a
   planning offsite for EA in October 1982. Following a long business day
   at the offsite, the dozen employees and advisers who were present
   agreed that they would stay up that night and see if they could agree
   unanimously on a new name for the company.^[[131]citation needed]

   Hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and
   calling the developers, "software artists." Hence, the latest version
   of the business plan had suggested the name "SoftArt". However, Hawkins
   and Melmon knew the founders of [132]Software Arts, the creators of
   [133]VisiCalc, and thought their permission should be obtained. But
   [134]Dan Bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too
   similar (perhaps "[135]confusingly similar") to Software Arts. However,
   the name concept was liked by all the attendees. Hawkins had also
   recently read a best-selling book about the film studio, [136]United
   Artists, and liked the reputation that company had created. Early
   advisers Andy Berlin, Jeff Goodby, and Rich Silverstein (who would soon
   form their own ad agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners) were also fans
   of that approach, and the discussion was led by Hawkins and Berlin.
   Hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to
   sleep.^[[137]citation needed]

   Hawkins liked the word "electronic", and various employees had
   considered the phrases "Electronic Artists" and "Electronic Arts".
   Other candidates included Gordon's suggestion of "Blue Light", a
   reference from the movie "Tron".^[[138]citation needed]

   When Gordon and others pushed for "Electronic Artists", in tribute to
   the [139]film company [140]United Artists, Steve Hayes opposed, saying,
   "We're not the artists, they are..." meaning that the developers whose
   games EA would publish were the artists. This statement from Hayes
   immediately tilted sentiment towards Electronic Arts and the name was
   unanimously endorsed.^[[141]citation needed]

[[142]edit] Sharing credit

   [143]Pinball Construction Set was an enormous hit for EA. The original
   version for the [144]Apple II by [145]Bill Budge was quickly
   [146]ported to other popular [147]home systems of the era.

   A novel approach to giving credit to its developers was one of EA's
   trademarks in its early days. This characterization was even further
   reinforced with EA's packaging of most of their games in the "album
   cover" pioneered by EA because Hawkins thought that a record album
   style would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling.^[148][6] EA
   routinely referred to their developers as "artists" and gave them photo
   credits in their games and numerous full-page [149]magazine ads. EA
   also shared lavish profits with their developers, which added to their
   industry appeal. Because of this novel treatment, EA was able to easily
   attract the best developers.^[[150]citation needed]

   The square "album cover" boxes (such as the covers for 1983's
   [151]M.U.L.E. and [152]Pinball Construction Set) were a popular
   packaging concept by Electronic Arts, which wanted to represent their
   [153]developers as "[154]rock stars".^[155][6]

[[156]edit] Hawkins exits

   After a very successful run on home computers, Electronic Arts later
   branched out and produced console games as well. Eventually Trip
   Hawkins left EA to found the now defunct [157]3DO company.

[[158]edit] 1991-2007

   EA is currently headquartered in the [159]Redwood Shores neighborhood
   of [160]Redwood City, [161]California. Following the departure of Trip
   Hawkins, [162]Larry Probst took over the reins and led the company to
   its current size and stature.^[[163]citation needed]
   Welcome sign at EA headquarters in Redwood Shores

   Probst considered himself a man of principle and has refused to follow
   the M-rated example set by [164]Take-Two Interactive, whose violent
   [165]Grand Theft Auto franchise became the dominant brand in many key
   demographics from 2000 through 2003.^[[166]citation needed] As a
   result, Probst was heavily criticized by Wall Street analysts, who
   believe that because of this policy, EA's stock price is lower than it
   should be.^[[167]citation needed] In late March 2005, Electronic Arts
   issued its first ever mid-quarter profit warning blaming hardware
   shortages and lower than expected fourth quarter sales.^[[168]citation
   needed]

   Not that M-rated games are new to EA: in 1999 EA approved its first
   M-rated game, [169]System Shock II for the PC. Probst later changed his
   overall stance on M-rated games, and now EA has several titles that
   compete in the M-rated, adult game arena.

   In 2004, EA made a multimillion dollar donation to fund the development
   of game production curriculum at [170]the University of Southern
   California's Interactive Media Division. In addition to the funds, EA
   staff members have been actively teaching and lecturing at the
   school.^[[171]citation needed]

   On 1 February 2006, Electronic Arts announced that it would cut
   worldwide staff by 5 percent.^[172][7]

   On 20 June 2006 EA purchased [173]Mythic Entertainment, currently
   working on [174]Warhammer Online. ^[175][8]

[[176]edit] Exclusive licenses

   After Sega's [177]ESPN NFL 2K5 successfully grabbed market share away
   from EA's dominant Madden NFL series during the 2004 holiday season, EA
   responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include
   an exclusive agreement with the [178]NFL, and in January 2005, a
   15-year deal with [179]ESPN, much as with Take-Two Interactive's
   exclusive licensing deal with [180]Major League Baseball.^[181][9] The
   ESPN deal gave EA exclusive first rights to all ESPN content for sports
   simulation games. On 11 April 2005, EA announced a similar, 6-year
   licensing deal with the [182]Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) for
   exclusive rights to [183]college football content.^[184][10]

[[185]edit] Development strategy

   Much of EA's success, both in terms of sales and with regards to its
   stock market valuation, is due to its strategy of platform-agnostic
   development and the creation of strong multi-year franchises. EA was
   the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports
   franchisesMadden, FIFA, NHL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods, etc.with updated
   player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks.^[186][11]
   Recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers, EA announced
   in 2006 that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new
   original [187]intellectual property.^[188][12]

[[189]edit] 2007

   In February 2007, Probst stepped down from the CEO job while remaining
   on the Board of Directors. His handpicked successor is [190]John
   Riccitiello, who had worked at EA for several years previously,
   departed for a while, and then returned.^[[191]citation needed]
   Riccitiello previously worked for [192]Elevation Partners, [193]Sara
   Lee and [194]Pepsico.

[[195]edit] City-state label model

   In June 2007, new CEO John Riccitiello announced that EA would
   reorganize itself into four labels, each with responsibility for its
   own product development and publishing (the city-state model). The goal
   of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more
   autonomously, streamline decision-making, increase creativity and
   quality, and get games into the market faster.^[196][13] This
   reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by EA
   of smaller studios, which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in
   quality of EA titles. In 2008, at the DICE Summit, Riccitiello called
   the earlier approach of "buy and assimilate" a mistake, often stripping
   smaller studios of its creative talent. Riccitiello said that the
   city-state model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to
   a large extent, and cited Maxis and Bioware as examples of studios
   thriving under the new structure.^[197][14]^[198][15]

[[199]edit] Mac games

   Also, in 2007, EA announced that it would be bringing some of its major
   titles to the [200]Macintosh. EA has released [201]Battlefield 2142,
   [202]Command & Conquer: Tiberium Wars, [203]Harry Potter and the Order
   of the Phoenix, [204]Madden NFL 08, [205]Need for Speed: Carbon and
   [206]Spore for the Mac. All of the new games have been developed for
   the Macintosh using Cider, a technology developed by TransGaming that
   enables [207]Intel-based Macs to run Windows games inside a translation
   layer running on Mac OS X. They are not playable on PowerPC-based
   Macs.^[208][16]

[[209]edit] Acquisitions

   In October 2007, EA purchased [210]Super Computer International, a long
   standing industry provider of game server hosting for development
   studios, who were currently developing the new [211]PlayLinc software.
   A week later they then purchased VG Holding Corp, the parent company of
   [212]BioWare and [213]Pandemic Studios.^[214][17]

[[215]edit] 2008-present

[[216]edit] Acquisitions

   It was revealed in February 2008 that Electronic Arts had made a
   takeover bid for rival game company [217]Take-Two Interactive. After
   its initial offer of $25 per share, all cash stock transaction offer
   was rejected by the Take-Two board, EA revised it to $26 per share, a
   64% premium over the previous day's closing price and made the offer
   known to the public.^[218][18] Rumours had been floating around the
   internet prior to the offer about Take-Two possibly being bought over
   by a bigger company, albeit with [219]Viacom as the potential
   bidder.^[220][19]^[221][20]

   In May 2008, EA announced that it will purchase the assets of Hands-On
   Mobile Korea, a South Korean mobile game developer and publisher. The
   company will become EA Mobile Korea.^[222][21]

   In September 2008, EA dropped its buyout offer of Take-Two. No reason
   was given.^[223][22]

[[224]edit] Casual & Sims label merger

   As of Nov 6, 2008 it was confirmed that Electronic Arts is closing
   their Casual Label & merging it with their [225]Hasbro partnership with
   [226]The Sims Label.^[227][23] EA also confirmed the departure of Kathy
   Vrabeck, who was given the position as former president of the EA
   Casual Division in May 2007. EA made this statement about the merger

     "Weve learned a lot about casual entertainment in the past two
     years, and found that casual gaming defies a single genre and
     demographic. With the departure of Kathy Vrabeck, EA is reorganizing
     to integrate casual games development and marketing into other
     divisions of our business. We are merging our Casual Studios, Hasbro
     partnership, and Casual marketing organization with The Sims Label
     to be a new Sims and Casual Label, where there is a deep
     compatibility in the product design, marketing and demographics."
     "In the days and weeks ahead, we will make further announcements on
     the reporting structure for the other businesses in the Casual Label
     including EA Mobile, Pogo, Media Sales and Online Casual
     Initiatives. Those businesses remain growth priorities for EA and
     deserve strong support in a group that will compliment their
     objectives."^[228][24]

   This statement comes a week after EA announced it was laying off 6%
   about 600 of their staff positions & had a $310 million net loss for
   the quarter.^[229][25]

[[230]edit] Label architecture and studios

   The following are the four Electronic Arts labels, with the studios
   that fall under each label ^[231][26]

[[250]edit] Downsizing

   Due to the [251]2008 Economic Crisis, Electronic Arts had a poorer than
   expected 2008 holiday season, moving it in February 2009 to cut
   approximately 1100 jobs, which it said represented about 11% of its
   workforce. It will also close 12 facilities, yet to be identified.
   Riccitiello, in a conference call with reporters, stated that their
   poor performance in the fourth quarter wasn't due entirely to the poor
   economy, but also to the fact that they didn't release any blockbuster
   titles in the quarter. In the quarter ending December 31, 2008, the
   company lost [252]USD$641 million.^[253][27]^[254][28]

[[255]edit] Criticism

[[256]edit] Studio acquisition and management practices

          See also: [257]List of acquisitions by Electronic Arts

   During its period of fastest growth, EA was often criticized for buying
   smaller development studios primarily for their intellectual property
   assets, and then producing drastically changed games of their
   franchises. For example, [258]Origin-produced [259]Ultima VIII: Pagan
   and [260]Ultima IX: Ascension were developed quickly under EA's
   ownership, over the protests of Ultima creator [261]Richard
   Garriott,^[262][29] and these two are considered by many^[263][30] as
   not up to the standard of the rest of the series.^[264][31]^[265][32]

   In early 2008, current CEO John Riccitiello stated that this practice
   by EA was wrong and that the company now gives acquired studios greater
   autonomy without "meddling" in their corporate culture.^[266][14]

   In 2008, [267]John D. Carmack of [268]id Software said that EA is no
   longer The Evil Empire. id decided to go with EA Partners, despite
   having a poor opinion of the publisher's past record. "I'll admit that,
   if you asked me years ago, I still had thoughts that EA was the Evil
   Empire, the company that crushes the small studios...I'd have been
   surprised, if you told me a year ago that we'd end up with EA as a
   publisher.", he said. "When we went out and talked to people,
   especially EA Partners people like Valve, we got almost uniformly
   positive responses from them." Like other EA Partners, such as
   Harmonix/MTV Games, Carmack stressed that EA Partners deal "isn't
   really a publishing arrangement. Instead, they really offer a menu of
   services--Valve takes one set of things, [269]Crytek takes a different
   set, and we're probably taking a third set". ^[270][33]

   EA was criticized for shutting down some of its acquired studios after
   they released poorly performing games (for instance, Origin).^[271][34]
   Though, in some of the cases, the shutdown was merely a reformation of
   teams working at different small studios into a single
   studio.^[272][35]^[273][36] The historical pattern of poor sales and
   ratings of the first game shipped after acquisition suggests EA's
   control and direction as being primarily responsible for the game's
   failure rather than the studio. In the past, [274]Magic Carpet 2 was
   rushed to completion over the objections of designer [275]Peter
   Molyneux and it shipped during the holiday season with several major
   bugs. Studios such as Origin and [276]Bullfrog Productions had
   previously produced games attracting a unsignificant fanbase. Many fans
   also became annoyed that their favorite developers were closed down,
   but some developers, for example the EALA studio, have stated that they
   try to carry on the legacy of the old studio (Westwood Studios). Once
   EA received criticism from labor groups for its dismissals of large
   groups of employees during the closure of a studio. However, later, it
   was confirmed that layoffs were not heavily confined to one team or
   another, countering early rumors that the teams were specifically
   targeted -- countering the implication that the under performance of
   certain games might have been the catalyst.^[277][37]

   EA was once criticized for the acquisition of 19.9 percent of shares of
   its competitor [278]Ubisoft, a move that many felt would lead to a
   hostile takeover but has never materialized as such. However, Ubisoft
   CEO Guillemot later indicated that a merger with EA was a possibility.
   "The first option for us is to manage our own company and grow it. The
   second option is to work with the movie industry, and the third is to
   merge," he said.^[279][38]

   EA was criticized in the media for its attempted [280]hostile takeover
   of [281]Take Two Interactive.^[282][39]

[[283]edit] Employment policy

   In 2004, Electronic Arts was criticized for employees working
   extraordinarily long hoursup to 100 hours per week and not just at
   "crunch" times leading up to the scheduled releases of products. The
   publication of the [284]EA Spouse blog, with criticisms such as "The
   current mandatory hours are 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.seven days a weekwith the
   occasional Saturday evening off for good behaviour (at 6:30
   p.m.)".^[285][40] The company has since settled a [286]class action
   lawsuit brought by [287]game artists to compensate for "unpaid
   overtime".^[288][41] The class was awarded $15.6 million. As a result,
   many of the lower-level developers (artists, programmers, producers,
   and designers) are now working at an hourly rate. A similar suit
   brought by [289]programmers was settled for $14.9 million.^[290][42]

   Since these criticisms first aired, it's been reported that EA has
   taken steps to positively address "work-life balance" concerns by
   focusing on long-term project planning, compensation, and communication
   with employees. These efforts accelerated with the arrival of John
   Riccitiello as CEO in February 2007. In December 2007, an internal EA
   employee survey showed a 13% increase in employee morale and a 21% jump
   in management recognition over a three year period.^[291][43]

   In May 2008, 'EA_Spouse' blog author Erin Hoffman, speaking to
   videogame industry news site [292]Gamasutra, stated that EA has made
   significant progress. Hoffman said that "I think EA is tremendously
   reformed, having made some real strong efforts to get the right people
   into their human resources department," and "I've been hearing from
   people who have gotten overtime pay there and I think that makes a
   great deal of difference. In fact, I've actually recommended to a few
   people I know to apply for jobs there."^[293][44]

[[294]edit] Game quality

   For 2006, the games review aggregation site [295]Metacritic gives the
   average of EA games as 72.0 (out of 100); 2.5 points behind
   [296]Nintendo (74.5) but ahead of the other first-party publishers
   Microsoft (71.6) and Sony (71.2). The closest third-party publisher is
   [297]Take-Two Interactive (publishing as 2K Games and Rockstar Games)
   at 70.3. The remaining top 10^[298][45] publishers ([299]Sega,
   [300]Konami, [301]THQ, [302]Ubisoft, [303]Activision) all rate in the
   mid 60s. Since 2005 EA has published three games, [304]Battlefield 2,
   [305]Crysis, and [306]Rock Band, that received Universal Acclaim
   (Metacritic score 90 or greater).

   EA's aggregate review performance had shown a downward trend in quality
   over recent years and was expected to affect market shares during
   competitive seasons. Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson had
   said, "Poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the EA brand.
   According to our ongoing survey of GameRankings.com aggregated review
   data, Electronic Arts' overall game quality continues to
   fall...Although market share has not declined dramatically to date, in
   years such as 2007, which promises to have tremendous competition, it
   seems likely if quality does not improve."^[307][46]^[308][47]

   EA had also received criticism for developing games that lack
   innovation vis--vis the number of gaming titles produced under the EA
   brand that show a history of yearly updates, particularly in their
   sporting franchises. These typically retail as new games at full market
   price and feature only updated team rosters in addition to incremental
   changes to game mechanics, the user interface, and graphics. One
   critique compared EA to companies like Ubisoft and concluded that EA's
   innovation in new and old IPs, "Crawls along at a snail's
   pace.",^[309][48] while even the company's own CEO, John Riccitiello,
   acknowledged the lack of innovation seen in the industry generally,
   saying, "We're boring people to death and making games that are harder
   and harder to play. For the most part, the industry has been
   rinse-and-repeat. There's been lots of product that looked like last
   year's product, that looked a lot like the year before." EA has
   announced that it is turning its attention to creating new game IPs in
   order to stem this trend, with recently acquired and critically
   acclaimed studios Bioware and Pandemic would be contributing to this
   process..^[310][49]^[311][50]

[[312]edit] Editing of Wikipedia

   On August 15, 2007 it was revealed that somebody with an [313]IP
   address linked to EA had made changes to its [314]Wikipedia
   entry.^[315][51]^[316][52] The changes made included erasing [317]Trip
   Hawkins as founder of the company and adding a paragraph emphasizing
   the work of former CEO, [318]Larry Probst, attempts to remove
   information regarding the infamous [319]EA Spouse scandal, which
   involved the poor treatment of workers and several paragraphs under
   criticism were removed. ^[320][51]

   An EA spokesperson told GamesIndustry.biz that "EA sometimes updates
   websites with info about the company, games and employees. For example,
   EA has sent a correction to Yahoo Finance when they had misspelled the
   name of an EA executive." While not specifically addressing the
   changes, EA's spokesperson explained that "Many companies routinely
   post updates on websites like Wikipedia to ensure accuracy of their own
   corporate information." ^[321][53]

[[322]edit] Anti-trust lawsuit

   On June 5, 2008, a lawsuit was filed in [323]Oakland, California
   alleging Electronic Arts is breaking United States anti-trust laws by
   signing exclusive contracts with the NFL Players Association, the NCAA
   and Arena Football League, to use players' names, likenesses and team
   logos. This keeps other companies from being able to sign the same
   agreements. The suit further accuses EA of raising the price of games
   associated with these licenses as a result of this action.^[324][54]
   However, in an interview with GameTap, Peter Moore claims it was the
   NFL that sought the deal. "To be clear, the NFL was the entity that
   wanted the exclusive relationship. EA bid, as did a number of other
   companies, for the exclusive relationship," Moore explained. "It wasn't
   on our behest that this went exclusive... We bid and we were very
   fortunate and lucky and delighted to be the winning licensee."
   ^[325][55]

[[326]edit] EULA Agreements and DRM

   In the September 2008 release of EA's game [327]Spore it was revealed
   that the [328]DRM scheme included a program called [329]SecuROM and a
   lifetime machine-activation limit of three (3) instances. A huge public
   outcry over this DRM scheme broke out over the internet and swarmed
   Amazon.com with one-star ratings and critical reviews of the game in
   order to get EA to "pay attention to their consumers".^[330][56] This
   DRM scheme, which was intended to hinder the efforts of pirates to
   illegally use and distribute EA software, instead mainly affected
   paying customers, as the game itself was pirated well before
   release.^[331][57] On September 13, 2008, it was announced that Spore
   was the most pirated game ever with over half a million illegal
   downloads within the first week of release.^[332][58] In response to
   customer reaction, EA officially announced its release of upcoming
   [333]Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 would increase the installation
   limit to 5 rather than 3.^[334][59] Many customers were still
   unsatisfied, claiming they were still renting the game at full price.

   On September 22, 2008, a global class action law suit was filed against
   EA regarding the DRM in Spore, complaining about EA not disclosing the
   existence of SecuROM from the game manual, and addresses how SecuROM
   runs with the nature of a [335]rootkit, including how it remains on the
   [336]hard drive even after Spore is
   uninstalled.^[337][60]^[338][61]^[339][62] On October 14, 2008, a
   similar class action lawsuit was filed against EA for the inclusion of
   DRM software in the free demo version of the Creature
   Creator.^[340][63]

   Electronic Arts also published a number of non-game titles. The most
   popular of these was closely related to the video game industry and was
   actually used by several of their developers. [404]Deluxe Paint
   premiered on the [405]Amiga in 1985 and was later ported to other
   systems. The last version in the line, Deluxe Paint V, was released in
   1994. Other non-game titles include [406]Music Construction Set (and
   [407]Deluxe Music Construction Set), [408]Deluxe Paint Animation and
   [409]Instant Music. EA also published a black and white animation tool
   called Studio/1, and a series of Paint titles on the Macintosh:
   Studio/8 and Studio/32 (1990).

[[410]edit] Logos

   The Electronic Arts logo has undergone few changes in the company's
   history.

                 The classic Electronic Arts logo, 19821999.

   Current Electronic Arts logo used since 1999.

   The original EASN and EA Sports logos.

[[411]edit] 1982 to 1999

   EA's classic Square/Circle/Triangle corporate logo, adopted shortly
   after its founding and phased out in 1999, was devised by [412]Barry
   Deutsch of [413]Steinhilber Deutsch and Gard design firm. The three
   shapes were meant to stand for the "basic alphabet of graphic design."
   The shapes were rasterized to connote technology.^[[414]citation
   needed]

   Many customers mistook the square/circle/triangle logo for a stylized
   "EOA." Though they thought the "E" stood for "Electronic" and "A" for
   "Arts," they had no idea what the "O" could stand for, except perhaps
   the o in "Electronic." An early [415]newsletter of EA, Farther, even
   jokingly discussed the topic in one issue, claiming that the square and
   triangle indeed stood for "E" and "A", but that the circle was merely
   "a [416]Nerf ball that got stuck in a floppy drive and has been popping
   up on our splash screens ever since."^[[417]citation needed] Other
   customers saw the logo as a stylized "ECA".

   Nancy Fong and Bing Gordon came up with the idea to hide the three
   shapes on the cover of every game, borrowing the idea from the
   [418]urban legends concerning the placement of the bunny symbols on the
   covers of [419]Playboy magazine.^[[420]citation needed] Finding the
   logo's hidden placement on early EA titles was a ritual for employees
   whenever a new cover was displayed outside Fong's
   cubicle.^[[421]citation needed]

   In December of 1986 David Gardner and Mark Lewis moved to the UK to
   open a European headquarters. Up until that point publishing of
   Electronic Arts Games, and the conversion of many of their games to
   [422]compact cassette versions in [423]Europe was handled by
   [424]Ariolasoft.

[[425]edit] 1999 to present

   The current EA logo was derived from the logo used by sub-brand [426]EA
   Sports. It was first used, in a different form, in 1992, when
   Electronic Arts introduced the "EASN" brand (later changed to "EA
   Sports" due to legal difficulties with [427]ESPN^[[428]citation
   needed]). The logo was modified and adopted company-wide around 1999.

[[429]edit] In-game logo introductions

     * late-1990s to 2001: Originally an explosion sound effect
       accompanying the letters for "Electronic Arts" flying into
       formation, followed by an electronic voice. The sound effects have
       changed in certain games (sounds of the letters whipping past, for
       example)
     * 1999 to 2003: An outlined circle flips and forms the modern EA
       Games logo. Accompanied by a synthesized ping sound.
     * 2002 to 2004: EA Games logo appearing on screen, accompanied by the
       voice "EA Games, *whisper* challenge everything".
     * 2005: Silver EA logo appearing then fading away
     * 2006 to present: The logo is different with every game, taking on
       certain visual aspects of the game it is presented with. However
       the EA letters always remain the same and the logo always remains a
       circle.

[[430]edit] Slogans

     * "We see farther." Founding tag line
     * "EA Games, challenge everything."
     * "EA Sports, it's in the game." a shortened version of their
       original slogan "If it's in the game, it's in the game.". "EA
       Sports, it's in the game" is spoken by Andrew Anthony, a journalist
       for [431]The Guardian and [432]The Observer.^[433][65]
