   Natchez is the county seat^[40][1] of and the largest and only
   incorporated city within [41]Adams County, [42]Mississippi, [43]United
   States. As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of
   18,464. One of Mississippi's oldest cities, it was founded in 1716,
   predating the current capital city [44]Jackson by more than a century.
   Located along the [45]Mississippi River, Natchez is the southern
   terminus of the [46]Natchez Trace Parkway. The city is famous in
   [47]American history for its role in the development of the [48]Old
   Southwest, particularly with respect to its location on the Mississippi
   River.

   Natchez is the principal city of the Natchez, MS[49]LA [50]Micropolitan
   Statistical Area.

[[70]edit] History

[[71]edit] Pre-European settlement (to 1716)

          Main article: [72]Natchez people

   The original site of Natchez was the main ceremonial village of the
   [73]Natchez (pronounced "Nochi") Indian tribe, who occupied the area
   for countless generations (and whose culture was unbroken since the
   8th-century, according to archaeological findings). Many early
   explorers, including De Soto, La Salle and Bienville made contact with
   the Natchez, some of whom left detailed records of their encounters.
   The Natchez's society was divided into nobles and commoners according
   to [74]matrilineal descent. The supreme Natchez chief, the "Great Sun"
   owed his position to the rank of his mother.

   The flat-topped ceremonial mounds built by the Natchez show the
   influence of moundbuilding cultures to the north in the Middle
   Mississippi River Valley (see [75]Mississippian culture). At Natchez,
   the Grand Village of the Natchez Indians is preserved as a [76]National
   Historic Landmark maintained by the Mississippi Department of Archives
   and History, and nearby [77]Emerald Mound, an earlier ceremonial center
   also in Adams County, may be visited just off the [78]Natchez Trace
   Parkway at mile marker 10.2.

[[79]edit] Colonial history (1716-1783)

   In 1716 the French founded [80]Fort Rosalie, in order to protect their
   trading post established in the Natchez territory in 1714. Permanent
   French settlements and plantations were subsequently established. The
   French inhabitants of the "Natchez colony" often found themselves in
   conflict with the Natchez, who were increasingly split into pro-French
   and pro-English factions. After several smaller wars, the Natchez
   launched a final war in November 1729 (the "Natchez War"), wiping out
   the French colony at Natchez. On [81]November 28, [82]1729, the Natchez
   Indians killed 138 Frenchmen, 35 French women, and 56 children (the
   largest death toll by an Indian attack in Mississippi's history).
   Counterattacks by the French and their Indian allies over the next two
   years resulted in most of the Natchez Indians being killed, enslaved,
   or forced to flee as refugees. Many of the refugees ultimately became
   part of the [83]Creek and [84]Cherokee nations. Descendants of the
   Natchez diaspora survive as the [85]Natchez Nation, a treaty tribe and
   confederate of the federally recognized Muscogee (Creek) Nation with a
   sovereign traditional government ^[86][2]. Subsequently, Fort Rosalie
   and the surrounding town, which was renamed after the extinguished
   tribe, spent periods under [87]British and then [88]Spanish colonial
   rule before finally being ceded to the [89]United States under the
   terms of the [90]Treaty of Paris (1783). However, the problem with the
   treaty was that Spain was not a party to it and it was Spanish forces
   that had taken Natchez from the British. Although the Spanish were
   loosely allied with the American Colonists, it was more an alliance of
   convenience for them, as an opportunity to advance their interests at
   the expense of the British. Once the war was over, the Spanish were not
   particularly inclined to give up that which they had taken by force and
   so, for a time, possession was, indeed, "nine-tenths of the law" as far
   as Natchez was concerned. A census of the Natchez district taken after
   the war in 1784 counted 1,619 people, including 498 African-American
   slaves.

[[91]edit] Under the early republic (1783-1860)

   "The Parsonage", Historic house in Natchez, Mississippi.

   In the late 18th-century Natchez was the starting point of the
   [92]Natchez Trace overland route, which ran from Natchez to
   [93]Nashville, Tennessee through what is now [94]Mississippi,
   [95]Alabama, and [96]Tennessee. The [97]Flatboatmen and [98]keelboatmen
   (locally called "Kaintucks" because they were usually from Kentucky,
   although the entire Ohio River Valley was well-represented amongst
   their numbers) who floated their produce downriver usually sold their
   wares at Natchez or New Orleans, including their boats (as lumber), and
   then made the long trek back north overland to their homes.

   On [99]October 27, [100]1795, the U.S. and Spanish signed the
   [101]Treaty of San Lorenzo, finally settling their decade-long boundary
   dispute, by which all Spanish claims to Natchez were formally
   surrendered to the United States. However, it took another three years
   for the official orders to reach the Spanish garrison there, which then
   surrendered the fort and possession of Natchez to the American forces
   under Major Isaac Guion on March 30, 1798. A week later, when the
   [102]Mississippi Territory was created by the [103]Adams
   administration, Natchez became its first capital. After several years
   as the territorial capital, a new capital was built six miles to the
   east and named "Washington" (also located in Adams County). After
   roughly fifteen years in this role, on 10 December 1817, the capital
   reverted back to Natchez, which became the first capital of the new
   State of [104]Mississippi, before being transferred yet again to
   [105]Washington sometime later. Finally, as the state's population
   shifted north and eastward, the capital was moved to the more centrally
   located city of [106]Jackson in 1822. However, throughout the course of
   the early 19th-century, Natchez remained the center of economic
   activity for the young state, due to its strategic location on the high
   bluffs on the eastern bank of the [107]Mississippi River, which had
   allowed it to develop into a bustling port. At Natchez, many local
   [108]plantation owners loaded their [109]cotton onto [110]steamboats at
   the landing known as Natchez-Under-the-Hill [111][1]and transported
   their wares downriver to [112]New Orleans or, sometimes, upriver to
   [113]St. Louis, Missouri or [114]Cincinnati, Ohio, where the cotton
   would be sold and transported to Northern and European spinning mills.

   The Natchez region, along with the [115]Sea Islands of [116]South
   Carolina and [117]Georgia, pioneered cotton agriculture in the United
   States. Until new hybridized breeds of cotton were created in the early
   19th-century, it was uneconomical to grow cotton in the United States
   anywhere other than those latter two areas. Although South Carolina
   came to dominate the cotton plantation culture of much of the
   Antebellum South, it was the Natchez District that first experimented
   with hybridization, making the cotton boom possible.

   On [118]May 7, [119]1840, an intense [120]tornado struck Natchez. This
   tornado killed 269 persons in Natchez, most of whom were on
   [121]flatboats in the [122]Mississippi River. The tornado killed 317
   persons in all, making it the second deadliest tornado in [123]United
   States history. This tornado is today known as the "[124]Great Natchez
   Tornado."

   The terrain around Natchez on the Mississippi side of the river is
   rather hilly. The city sits on a high bluff above the Mississippi river
   and in order to reach the riverbank one must travel down a steep road
   to the landing called Silver Street. This is in marked contrast to the
   flat "delta" lowland found across the river surrounding the city of
   [125]Vidalia, Louisiana. Today, Natchez is well-known for the numerous
   [126]Antebellum mansions and estates built by its early 19th-century
   planter society, many of whom owned plantations in Louisiana but chose
   to locate their homes on the higher ground in Mississippi. Prior to the
   [127]American Civil War, Natchez had the most millionaires per capita
   of any city in the United States, making it arguably the wealthiest
   city in the nation at the time. It was frequented by notables such as
   [128]Aaron Burr, [129]Henry Clay, [130]Andrew Jackson, [131]Zachary
   Taylor and [132]Jefferson Davis. Today the city boasts that it has more
   antebellum homes than anywhere else in the United States, partly due to
   the fact that during the [133]War Natchez was spared the destruction of
   many other [134]Southern cities, such as [135]Vicksburg to the north.

[[136]edit] American Civil War (1861-1865)

   During the Civil War, Natchez remained largely undisturbed, but not
   entirely. Natchez surrendered to [137]Flag-Officer David G. Farragut
   after the fall of New Orleans in May 1862.^[138][3] In September, 1863,
   the Union ironclad [139]USS Essex,^[140][4] under Capt. [141]William D.
   Porter shelled the town but caused only minor damage, although a seven
   year-old Jewish girl named Rosalie Beekman was tragically
   killed.^[142][5]^[143][6] Union troops under [144]Ulysses S. Grant
   occupied Natchez in 1863; Grant set up his temporary headquarters in
   the Natchez mansion [145]Rosalie.^[146][7] Confederate army forces
   attempted to recapture Natchez in December 1863 but did not attack the
   town itself because the C.S.A. forces were outnumbered.^[147][8]

   Like almost everywhere else in the United States, numerous Natchez
   residents did in fact fight or otherwise participate in the war and
   many families lost their antebellum fortunes. The fact that the town
   was largely spared the horrors of the war is illustrated by the legend
   of the Battle of Natchez. According to this story, while Union troops
   were being housed in Natchez, civilians and regular bar owners gathered
   at the river landing to watch Union gunboats travel the Mississippi
   River from Vicksburg down to New Orleans. In one passing, a Union
   gunboat fired a blank from a canon to rile up the Union troops at Fort
   Rosalie. This caused an elderly man to have a heart attack at Under the
   Hillthe one casualty in the Battle of Natchez.^[148][9]

   Despite the city's relatively peaceful atmosphere under Union
   occupation, Natchez residents remained somewhat defiant of the Federal
   authorities. In 1864, the [149]Roman Catholic [150]bishop of the
   [151]Diocese of Natchez, [152]William Henry Elder, refused to obey a
   Federal order to compel his parishioners to pray for the [153]President
   of the United States. In response, the Federals arrested Elder, jailed
   him briefly and then banished him across the river to Confederate held
   [154]Vidalia, Louisiana. Eventually Elder was allowed to come back to
   Natchez and resumed his clerical duties there until 1880, when he was
   elevated to [155]archbishop of Cincinnati.

[[156]edit] Postwar period (1865-present)

   Natchez was able to make a rapid economic comeback in the postwar
   years, as much of the commercial traffic on the Mississippi River
   resumed. In addition to cotton, the development of local industries
   like logging added to the exports through the city's wharf. In return,
   Natchez saw an influx of manufactured goods from Northern markets like
   Cincinnati, [159]Pittsburgh, and St. Louis.

   The city's prominent place in Mississippi River commerce over the
   nineteenth century has been illustrated by the nine different
   steamboats plying the lower river between 1823 and 1918 that were named
   Natchez, many of which were built for and commanded by the famous
   Captain Thomas P. Leathers, whom [160]Jefferson Davis had wanted to
   head the [161]Confederate defense fleet on the Mississippi River,
   though this never materialized. In 1885, the [162]Anchor Line, known
   for its sublime luxury steamboats operating between St. Louis and New
   Orleans, launched its "brag boat," the City of Natchez, though this
   boat survived only a year before succumbing to a fire at [163]Cairo,
   Illinois, on 28 December 1886. Since 1975, an excursion steamboat at
   New Orleans has also borne the name Natchez.

   This river commerce sustained the city's economic growth until just
   after the turn of the twentieth century, when steamboat traffic began
   to be replaced by the [164]railroads. The city's economy declined over
   the course of the century, as in many Mississippi towns, although
   tourism has helped compensate for the decline.

   In 1940, 209 people died in a fire at the [165]Rhythm Night Club. This
   fire has been noted as the fourth deadliest fire in U.S.
   history.^[166][10]

   [167]Disney's [168]The Adventures of Huck Finn was partially filmed
   here in 1993. Coincidentally, the 1982 [169]television movie Rascals
   and Robbers: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn was filmed
   here.
