Doomsday Clock

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Doomday Clock)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   "Minutes to Midnight" redirects here, along with other titles
   incorporating that term. For other uses, see [9]Minutes to Midnight
   (disambiguation). For the Smashing Pumpkins song, see [10]Doomsday
   Clock (song).
   As of 2009^[11][update], The Doomsday Clock reads
   five-minutes-to-midnight.

   The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face, maintained since 1947 by
   the board of directors of the [12]Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists at
   the [13]University of Chicago, that uses the analogy of the human race
   being at a time that is "minutes to [14]midnight", wherein midnight
   represents "catastrophic destruction". Originally, the analogy
   represented the threat of global nuclear war, but since includes
   climate-changing technologies and "new developments in the life
   sciences and [15]nanotechnology that could inflict irrevocable
   harm".^[16][1]

   Since its inception, the clock has appeared on every cover of the
   [17]Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Its first representation was in
   1947, when magazine co-founder Hyman Goldsmith asked artist Martyl
   Langsdorf (wife of [18]Manhattan Project physicist Alexander Langsdorf,
   Jr.) to design a cover for the magazine's June 1947 issue.

   The number of minutes before midnight measuring the degree of nuclear,
   environmental, and technological threats to mankind is periodically
   corrected; currently, the clock reads five minutes to midnight, having
   advanced two minutes on 17 January 2007.

[[27]edit] Time changes

   Cover of the 1947 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists issue that first
   featured the Doomsday Clock at seven minutes to midnight.

   In 1947 during the U.S.U.S.S.R. [28]Cold War, the clock was started at
   seven minutes to midnight, and subsequently advanced and rewound per
   the state of the world and [29]nuclear war prospects. Setting the clock
   is relatively arbitrary, and decided by the directors of the Bulletin
   of the Atomic Scientists reflecting global affairs. The clock has not
   always been set and reset as quickly as events occur; the closest
   nuclear war start, the [30]Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, reached
   crisis, climax, and resolution before it could be set to reflect that
   possible doomsday.

   The most recent officially-announced setting five minutes to midnight
   was on 17 January 2007.^[31][2]^[32][3] Reflecting international events
   dangerous to mankind, the clock hands have been set eighteen times,
   since its initial start at seven minutes to midnight in 1947.

   probability of catastrophe is deemed to be.

   materials, and the continued presence of some 26,000 nuclear weapons in
   the United States and Russia.^[58][4] Experts assessing the dangers
   posed to civilization have added [59]climate change to the prospect of
   nuclear annihilation as the greatest threats to humankind.^[60][5]

[[61]edit] In popular culture

[[62]edit] In fiction

     * The clock used in the [63]Watchmen [64]comic book series is a
       reference to The Doomsday Clock. On page 18 of issue #1, a
       newspaper on [65]Adrian Veidt's desk bears the headline "Nuclear
       Doomsday Clock Stands At Five To Twelve, Warn Experts". Clocks on
       walls throughout the series display this time.
     * The Doomsday Clock is referenced in [66]Piers Anthony's novel,
       [67]Wielding a Red Sword, in which the mythical [68]Incarnation of
       War can control the position of the hands up to midnight and
       thereby bring about [69]World War III.

[[70]edit] In music

     * The Doomsday Clock is alluded to throughout "[71]2 Minutes to
       Midnight", a single from [72]Iron Maiden's album [73]Powerslave. In
       the cover of the band's single, the mascot Eddie is sitting in
       front of a ruined United Nations building with the flags of nations
       flying at half-mast. A nuclear explosion is in the background.
     * [74]Linkin Park's third album, [75]Minutes to Midnight, is a
       reference to the Doomsday Clock. In the music video for "[76]Shadow
       of the Day", the current time is shown at the beginning of the
       video; by the end, it would have nearly reached midnight.^[77][6]

[[78]edit] In television

     * The [79]Doctor Who episode "[80]Four to Doomsday" was first aired
       in 1982, when the clock was at four minutes to midnight.
     * The [81]NCIS episode "Murder 2.0" features an image of the Doomsday
       clock used as a clue that the Cybervid Killer's next murder will
       take place at five minutes to midnight, the time at which the clock
       is currently set.
     * The [82]Heroes episode "[83]Seven Minutes to Midnight" aired in
       2006, when the clock was set at seven minutes to midnight. The
       season dealt with the heroes stopping a nuclear bomb going off in
       [84]New York City.
