   Do! Run Run (1984, also known as Super Pierrot in Japan) is the 4th and
   final incarnation of [21]Mr. Do!, the [22]Universal video game mascot.
   Returning to his Mr. Do! roots, the clown has a bouncing powerball with
   which to hurl at monsters. What makes this game novel is that instead
   of burrowing through the ground to get at cherries, Mr. Do runs along
   the playfield picking up dots, and leaving a line behind him, which the
   player is encouraged to create closed off sections with, which turn any
   dots left behind into cherries. Gone are the giant apples to crush
   foes, but the multi-tier stage design has two precariously balanced log
   traps, which roll downslope if either pushed from above or closely
   approached from the propped up stick side. The resulting game is
   somewhat of a cross between Mr. Do!, [23]Congo Bongo, [24]Pac-Man, and
   [25]Qix. The title is a reference to the song [26]Da Doo Ron Ron.

[[33]edit] Goal

   The goal of Do! Run Run is to rack up points while completing screens.
   A screen is completed whenever all the fruits/dots are eaten, or when
   all of the regular monsters (not Alpha-monsters or their sidekicks) are
   defeated. Using the rope that follows Mr. Do to inscribe dots will
   convert them into cherries, a familiar fruit for Mr. Do to collect.
   Cherries are worth more points than dots, and eating them restores the
   powerball more quickly than eating dots would. Each time Mr. Do
   inscribes fruit, they progress to a higher tier, dots become cherries,
   cherries become apples, apples become lemons and lemons become
   pineapples. Eating a dot awards 10 points and 1/16th of a powerball
   recharge; eating a pineapple is worth 160 points and 1/4th of a
   powerball recharge.

   Players are additionally encouraged to inscribe sections of the
   playfield by the letters E, X, T, R, A, a constant feature of Mr. Do!
   games. Randomly, one of the inscribed fruits will turn into a flashing
   letter spot, corresponding with the movement of the Alpha-monster at
   the top of the screen. If Mr. Do! runs over this spot, the monster
   sporting that letter will release from the top of the screen with three
   blue henchmen, and chase after Mr. Do. Defeating the Alpha-monster will
   lock in that letter, and once all 5 letters are earned, the player
   earns an extra life (as well as progressing to the next stage, you also
   earn a 5,000 point bonus).

   Points are also awarded for defeating monsters. Directly firing the
   powerball at a monster awards 500 points and consumes the powerball,
   which needs to be replenished by eating fruit. More points are earned
   if the powerball bounces off of a surface; each bounce raises the bonus
   by 500 points until a maximum of 3000 points are earned. Smashing
   monsters with a rolling log earns 1000 points; it is possible to roll
   over multiple monsters and earn a cumulative bonus of 500 per extra
   monster (so, 1500 for the 2nd, 2000 for the 3rd, etc.). Apparently
   there is a 10,000 point bonus for smashing 5 monsters.

[[34]edit] Monsters

   Like other Mr. Do! games, the monsters are nameless (except
   Alpha-monsters) and defy easy description. Two types of monsters
   attempt to foil the clown's efforts, a green clam-like monster, and a
   blue snake-like monster. Neither are particularly sophisticated,
   although the clam monsters have some seemingly clever moments where
   they bumble into your path or out of the way of the powerball. The blue
   snakes will, if you linger too long on a direct path from them, convert
   into a fireball and charge across the playing field. As is common with
   arcade games, contact with monsters is instantly fatal, with Mr. Do
   shown to be electrocuted, complete with visible flashing skeleton.

   After some time on each stage elapses, the music changes and any
   surviving monsters convert into a different form; the clam monsters
   become blue and armored with spines, the snake monsters essentially
   become different looking snake monsters. The speed of each monster, and
   the willingness to chase Mr. Do, are about the only other major
   changes; they can be fairly easily eluded so long as the player does
   not simply run away from them. Instead, Mr. Do should climb up or down
   the terrain if too closely chased; monsters lose a lot of time changing
   levels on the playfield whereas Mr. Do gets a slight speed up for going
   downslope. After a short duration, the music resumes, and the monsters
   transform back into their old selves, with the pattern of
   transformation repeating.

   Alpha-monsters, when they are summoned by the letter circle, are
   released with three henchmen. The henchmen home in on Mr. Do! and
   typically precede the alpha-monster. Killing the Alpha-monster rids the
   playfield of the henchmen, although it is easier to lure all four into
   the path of a log and smash them. Alpha-monsters are also released
   every time the score reaches increments of 5,000 points unless there is
   already an alpha-monster on the playfield.

[[35]edit] Strategy

   Do! Run Run is a fairly simple game; points can easily be earned simply
   by running around the playing field and inscribing as many fruit as
   possible four times, thus turning them all into melons. Once this is
   done, the player can dispatch monsters in the most profitable manner
   possible, or simply wipe out all but one, evading the surviving monster
   until the Alpha-monster displayed is a letter the player wants, then
   picking up fruits until the score reaches an increment of 10,000.
   Delaying too long will mean that the surviving monster becomes
   inescapably fast, however, so sometimes it is better to move on to the
   next round rather than risking being killed.

[[36]edit] Free games

   While this can be configured by the ROM to not occur, infrequently, a
   bonus diamond worth 10,000 points will show up in the same manner as
   the letter circles when fruit are inscribed. If the player collects
   this, the stage ends and they are awarded a bonus credit. This feature
   was also in the original version of Mr. Do.

[[37]edit] Ports

   The game has been ported to [38]MSX in 1987 and to [39]Commodore Amiga
   and [40]Atari ST in 1990.
