[[91]edit] Story

   EverQuest II is set on the fictional world of [92]Norrath five hundred
   years after the [93]The Planes of Power storyline of the original
   [94]EverQuest game. The gods withdrew from the world in retaliation for
   mortal incursions into their planes. On Norrath itself, Dark Elves and
   the Orcs destroyed much of [95]Faydwer; while the Ogres, Goblins, Orcs,
   and Giants ravaged [96]Antonica. Transport and communication to the
   moon [97]Luclin were cut off.

   The storyline says that 100 years ago, the continent of Antonica was
   ripped apart into smaller islands, which are now called the Shattered
   Lands. The oceans became impassible, preventing contact between the
   continents of Norrath. Fifteen years ago, the moon Luclin exploded and
   parts of the Shattered moon remain in the sky.

   EverQuest II takes place in what is called the Age of Destiny. In this
   setting, Queen Antonia Bayle of Qeynos is a benevolent sorceress who
   welcomes all goodly races to her city to help rebuild Norrath. The
   Overlord of Freeport, Lucan D'Lere, a centuries-old fallen paladin,
   rules the evil races in his plans of conquest.

[[98]edit] Gameplay

   Within EverQuest II, each player creates a character to interact in the
   3-D fictional world of Norrath. Within the game, the character can
   adventure (complete quests, explore the world, kill monsters and gain
   treasures and experience) and socialize with other players. The game
   also has a 'tradeskill' system that allows players to create items for
   in-game use.

   In the creation of a character, the player may choose the character's
   [99]race and class. Various classes have specialized abilities that are
   complementary to their class. (Monks will get mainly melee combat
   abilities that use their fists or fist weapons, or a Warlock will get
   mainly spell abilities that do large amounts of spike damage but cost a
   lot of mana.) EverQuest II enables social interaction with other
   players through grouping and through the creation of [100]guilds. Like
   players, guilds can gain experience and levels, partially from players
   completing special tasks called Heritage quests, but primarily from
   guild-oriented quests and tasks called "writs," and gaining guild
   experience by killing epic monsters. Higher guild levels open up
   special rewards unavailable to non-guilded characters, and cause
   certain other rewards to cost less. These rewards include housing
   options, mounts, house items, apparel, and special titles.

   Although EverQuest II focuses on player versus environment (PvE),
   dedicated [101]player versus player (PvP) servers were added in
   February 2006.

[[102]edit] Features

   The Everquest II feature set has expanded since its release in 2004.
   Here is an overview of the feature set as of January 2009:
     * Players choose from 19 races and 24 adventure classes. Any race can
       be any class (with some conditions). Five starting cities are
       provided, each with its own "newbie" experience.
     * Each character may advance through 80 levels of experience in his
       chosen adventure class, and 80 levels in a tradeskill class that is
       chosen after creation. Characters are customized by earning up to
       200 "achievement points" during the course of gameplay, which are
       used to choose achievement abilities (or AAs). Each adventure class
       has three trees of achievement abilities to invest in.
     * Every character can have a Tradeskill Class in addition to their
       Adventuring Class. When crafting items, the player reacts to
       crafting events by using crafting skills. A secure commission
       system allows players to sell their crafting skills to other
       players, or use the common market system to sell finished items.
     * Heavy focus on quests. More than 6000 quests have been discovered
       by players as of January 2009.^[103][1] Game rewards are biased
       toward quests. Much of the game lore is presented through quests,
       using an interactive dialogue system.
     * Each adventure class accumulates more than 20 distinct abilities. A
       single mechanic is used for both melee (Combat Arts) and
       spellcasting (Spells); both types of classes draw from a Power pool
       to cast their abilities. Every spell can be upgraded through eight
       tiers of improvement, with the lowest tier granted automatically
       upon gaining each adventure level. Spell upgrades are obtained just
       like equipment upgrades - as loot, quest rewards, or produced
       through crafting. Bonus effects are triggered when players combine
       their abilities in specific ways, called a Heroic Opportunity.
     * No experience loss, corpse runs on death, or lost levels from
       dying. Characters respawn with their gear intact at specific
       revival locations, with a minor experience debt to be repaid. Gear
       is fully functional until its condition runs out after 10
       consecutive deaths, and is repaired to 100% for a fee.
     * A mentoring system allows a high-level character to pretend to be a
       lower-level character, when grouped with another player of lower
       level. All equipment and abilities of the mentor are scaled down
       appropriately, and a bonus is granted to the lower-level
       character's rate of advancement.
     * Starting at level 20, players can wear any clothing that's allowed
       by their class in "appearance slots", overriding the appearance of
       their functional gear. Face and hair customizations can be changed
       by visiting a Barber Shop. A Dressing Room feature allows players
       to see what their character would look like wearing equipment that
       they do not possess.
     * Each guild has an experience bar and earns guild levels (up to 80).
       The guild gains experience when its members perform tasks that earn
       city status. Higher guild levels unlock new items, mounts, houses,
       guild halls, and other privileges for its members. Guilds get
       hosted website and forum, and a guild bank with officer controls.
     * Player housing is accessible to players from level 1. Furniture is
       stackable and scalable, and in-house pets are available. House
       styles are unique to each of six cities, with various sizes and
       layouts available in each. Player houses can be shared and visited
       at the owner's discretion, are connected to the player market
       system. A recent expansion of the housing system provides guilds
       with guild halls.
     * Player interaction features include integrated Voice Chat, a
       built-in mail system, and global chat channels. A looking-for-group
       tool is provided, and looking-for-work for crafters. A guild
       recruitment tool is integrated into the game. Players can view each
       others' statistics and leveling history on the EQ2Players web site.
       Basic features are free, while advanced features require a monthly
       fee.

[[104]edit] Gameplay differences between EQ2 and the original EverQuest

   Many gameplay choices were made in order to stop old, sometimes
   undesirable, tactics that emerged in EQ; a major difference is the
   concept of "locked encounters". Currently a group or a solo player can
   set an option to lock encounters. When encounters are locked, only the
   player or group who becomes linked to that encounter is involved, which
   stops [105]kill stealing. Other players cannot assist in the encounter
   unless the player who locked it uses a special "/yell" command for
   help, after which the encounter rewards neither loot nor experience.

   "Trains" (encounters pursuing fleeing players to a zone line, and then
   attack uninvolved players), a problem in Everquest, are no longer a
   problem in EQ2. Encounters will not agro on (attack) uninvolved players
   until they first return to their original location. Encounters
   returning to their spawn point are also immune to attack until they
   return there.

   To stop [106]kiting, players in combat lose all their movement speed
   enhancements except the special "sprint" ability, which costs a
   considerable amount of power to use, although some classes have speed
   debuffs that slow the enemy, thus making kiting a viable option.
   Because certain player classes such as Rangers and Mages have limited
   effectiveness in close melee range, many of these players have
   discovered another method of pseudo-kiting by running backwards and
   firing a missile weapon at the enemy. The enemy lands fewer attacks,
   but can take significant damage depending on the type of ammunition or
   missile weapon used, and the skill level of the user.

[[107]edit] Setting

   Darathar, a dragon in the world of EverQuest II, is part the
   "Prismatic" quest series.

   EverQuest II is set in what is called the "Age of Destiny" on the world
   of [108]Norrath, 500 years later than the setting of the original
   EverQuest. The game world has been drastically affected by several
   cataclysms (see [109]Story, above) since the original EverQuest. The
   planes have closed, the gods temporarily left, and the moon Luclin has
   been destroyed (and partially rained onto the face of Norrath).
   Remnants from the original EQ's Norrath can be found throughout the
   Shattered Lands.

   Players arrive in one of five tutorial areas: The Queen's Colony, The
   Outpost of the Overlord, The Nursery in Greater Faydark, Hate's Envy in
   Darklight Woods, and Timorous Deep in Kunark, and then move to one of
   five cities, Qeynos or Kelethin (the 'good' cities) or Freeport,
   Neriak, or Gorowyn (the 'evil' cities). All of the other cities in the
   world were destroyed, taken over (Ak'anon, Kaladim, and a few others),
   rendered inaccessible (Halas), or have banished all outsiders (Felwithe
   and Rivervale) in The Shattering. The original player cities that were
   present at the game's launch (Qeynos and Freeport) are divided into
   multiple zones, with the playable races each having their own special
   section (Village) of these cities. The player cities introduced into
   the game at later dates (Kelethin and Neriak) are smaller than the
   original cities, and as such each 'newer' city is completely contained
   within one zone. Players from Qeynos or Kelethin are not welcome in
   Freeport or Neriak and vice versa unless they choose to betray their
   city via the Betrayal Questline. Players are allowed to begin the
   Betrayal Questline from level 10 onwards.

   The game world features wide geographical and ecological variety.

   In EQ2, players can ride trained [110]griffons on predetermined routes
   over the Shattered Lands, or acquire a horse, [111]flying carpet,
   [112]warg, rhino or a floating disk so that they can travel more
   swiftly throughout much of the game world. "Mariner's Bells" are
   scattered across the land allowing instant transportation across
   various areas of the world. With the inception of the Kingdom of Sky
   expansion, the Ulteran wizard spires teleport you up into Kingdom of
   Sky, with spires in different zones taking you to different areas of
   the expansion. With the Echoes of Faydwer expansion, Wardens and Furies
   (the Druid classes) gained the ability to teleport individuals to one
   of five druid rings, with two more added in the Rise of Kunark
   expansion. Likewise, Warlocks and Wizards (the Sorcerer classes) gained
   the ability to teleport themselves or their groups to one of three
   wizard spires.

   EverQuest II also includes instanced zonesparallel copies of some zones
   where characters in one 'instance' of the zone cannot interact with the
   characters or MOBs of any other 'instance' of that zone.

[[113]edit] Races and classes

[[114]edit] Character races

   Players must choose a 'race' when creating a character. The choice of
   races include human, ogre, dwarf, wood elf and dark elf (and others
   which were available in the original EQ) along with new options such as
   the Kerra (a cat-person similar to the Vah Shir of the original EQ),
   the Ratonga (a rat-like people) and with the purchase of an expansion,
   fae and Arasai. The Froglok race was originally locked until a special
   server-wide quest was completed to make them playable. Some races are
   restricted to either Qeynos or Freeport, based on their [115]alignment,
   but can turn traitor and move to the opposing city.

   it.)
   ^4Introduced with Rise of Kunark Expansion. Characters created in
   Timorous Deep are considered evil by other entities in the game, but
   the city itself is neutral as a mercenary city.

[[116]edit] Adventurer classes

   There are four "[117]archetypes" in EQ2 - Fighter, Scout, Priest and
   Mage. When EQ2 was launched, a player chose the character's archetype
   during the initial character creation and then chose a 'class' at level
   10 and a 'sub-class' at level 20. This system was changed in Live
   Update 19 in January 2006 so that a character's final class is chosen
   at creation. While archetype>class>sub-class system is no longer
   explicitly defined in the live game, it still defines the roles of
   classes. Broadly, in a group situation, any priest can be a healer, any
   fighter can be a suitable tank, any mage or scout can deal damage, with
   the mage classes typically being able to deal more damage than a scout
   class, but being more fragile. Evil classes, such as the Assassin, are
   only available in Freeport, Neriak, or Gorowyn, while good classes,
   such as the Paladin, are available in either Qeynos or Kelethin.
   Neutral classes, such as the Guardians, are available in all cities.
   Ivory background means the class is available in all cities, light blue
   background means Qeynos and Kelethin only, reddish background means
   Freeport, Neriak, and Gorowyn only.

        Enchanter Illusionist
                    Coercer

[[118]edit] Betrayal

   Betrayal is a process allowing the player to change from a good or evil
   alignment to the opposing one, and convert to the good or evil
   counterpart of their current class. In this manner, one can play a
   traditionally evil-only race, betray their city of origin in favor of a
   good-aligned city, and play a good-only class. Naturally, the reverse
   is also possible-betrayal of a good-aligned city in favor of an evil
   one in order to access an evil class with a good race.

[[119]edit] Artisan classes

   A character can also undertake a tradeskill profession, completely
   separate from his/her adventuring profession. The tradeskill
   professions branch at levels 10 and 20, just as adventuring classes
   used to.

   The [120]Echoes of Faydwer expansion introduced two secondary
   tradeskills. These go alongside the primary tradeskills, and a
   character can switch to the other secondary tradeskill at any time
   (starting from scratch). Characters do not gain separate experience
   points for these tradeskills; maximum skill level rises with the
   primary tradeskill or adventuring level.

      Transmuter Breaks certain valuable equipment down into in magical
    components which can be used to create adornments and tinkered items.

[[121]edit] Voices

   The game uses actual voices for NPCs. The actors used for these parts
   included [122]Hollywood stars such as [123]Heather Graham (as Queen
   Antonia Bayle) and [124]Christopher Lee (as Overlord Lucan D'Lere).
   [125]Actor/[126]gamer [127]Wil Wheaton, [128]Actor [129]Dwight Schultz
   and [130]Actress/[131]mathematician [132]Danica McKellar are also part
   of the cast. According to SOE in October 2004, EverQuest II featured
   130 hours of spoken dialog recorded by 1,700 voice
   actors.^[[133]citation needed] More dialog has been added since release
   as part of regular game updates. In September 2005, [134]EverQuest II:
   Desert Of Flames added player Voice Emotes.

[[135]edit] Music

   The music for the game, over ninety minutes' worth, was composed by
   [136]Emmy-award winning composer [137]Laura Karpman and recorded by the
   FILMharmonic Orchestra Prague under her direction. Karpman has said of
   the music in the game: "Every place has a theme, its own separate,
   unique feeling - from a quasi-African savanna to a Babylonian city.
   Every cue in EQ2, with the exception of the attack cues, is like a main
   title of a movie. A more cinematic experience for the player was one of
   our goals." [138][1]. Purchasers of the EverQuest II Collector's
   Edition received a soundtrack CD as part of the package.

   The most recent expansions, Echoes of Faydwer and Rise of Kunark,
   included many themes from the corresponding zones in the original
   EverQuest, arranged by [139]Inon Zur.

   With the recent Rise of Kunark expansion came a major update to the
   combat music. A new system was added with 14 contextual combat themes.
   The strength of the enemy or enemies and tide of the battle determine
   the tone of the combat music. The previous combat music consisted of
   just a few linear pieces.

[[140]edit] Business

   SOE is marketing EverQuest II not as a direct sequel, but as a
   "parallel universe" to the original EverQuest. It is set in an
   alternate future of the original game's setting, having diverged at the
   conclusion of [141]the Planes of Power expansion (the lore is explained
   in an in-game book). This allows both development teams to pursue
   whatever direction they want to take without impacting the other, and
   allows players of the original EverQuest to continue receiving updates
   without forcing players down a specific path. In that sense, they are
   two completely separate games bound together by name only. Players of
   the old EQ will find many familiar places and characters, as well as
   "heritage items" that are similar in name and function to items known
   from EQ and can be gained via heritage quests.

   Like the original and other commercial [142]MMORPGs, EQ2 requires a
   monthly fee (as of January 2008, US$14.99/month) to play the game. A
   free play period of 30 days are included with the purchase price of the
   game. Subscribers can opt to pay an additional monthly fee for extended
   services, such as an online item database or hosting of guild websites.
   Players can also download and play the game for free as part of a free
   trial. Prior free trial programs, known as the Trial of the Isle and
   Play the Fae, allowed players to experience the beginning steps of the
   game for free before dedicating themselves to a monthly subscription
   fee. The current free trial allows players full use of the game
   environment, but it is limited to 14 days and prevents characters from
   exceeding level 20.

   In Europe, the game is published by [143]KOCH Media.
   Advertisement of the [144]Pizza Hut and EverQuest II promotion.

   In February 2005, EverQuest II began allowing players to place an order
   for [145]pizza delivery from within the game, with a simple and easy
   command typed into the chat bar, "/pizza".^[146][2] This promotion has
   since ended, but generated significant press for the game.

   In June 2005, SOE introduced [147]Station Exchange to EverQuest II.
   Station Exchange is an official auction systemonly on designated
   serversallowing real money to be transferred for in-game money, items
   or characters.

   In March 2006, SOE announced that it would end its Chinese/Korean
   operations for EverQuest II, which were being supported in the region
   by [148]Gamania. The beta period for the game in China/Korea ended on
   29 March, and on 30 March, all Chinese/Korean accounts were moved to
   the US servers of the game.

   In July 2007, SOE introduced magazine [149]EQuinox, which is the
   official magazine of EverQuest II. The release date of this magazine
   was 9 August 2007.

   [161]The Shadow Odyssey^[162][3] Expansion      18 November 2008

   With Everquest II, [163]Sony Online Entertainment introduced the
   concept of Adventure Packs. Adventure Packs are meant to be smaller
   "mini-expansions" to the game, adding a plot line with several zones,
   new creatures and items to the game via digital download. These smaller
   Adventure Packs come with a smaller fee ranging from [164]US$4.99 to
   US$7.99. However, recently the development team has decided to release
   free zones and content instead of making adventure packs. Some recent
   releases include a new starting city, Neriak, with a new starting race,
   Arasai;^[165][4] and new high level dungeons The Throne of New
   Tunaria^[166][5] and the Estate of Unrest.^[167][6]

   Expansions usually cost in the range of US$29.99 to US$39.99 and are
   shipped in boxes to stores, but can also be downloaded through a
   digital service. The retail versions often come packaged with a bonus
   feature such as a creature that the player can put in their in-game
   house. Expansions generally introduce many new zones with many plot
   lines, new features, many new creatures and items, new cities, and
   often come with a boost in the level cap or a new player race. While it
   may be easier to download the expansions digitally, traditional retail
   offers more content.

   In May 2007, the website [168]Allakhazam's Magical Realm in conjunction
   with [169]Online Gaming Radio announced that the next expansion would
   be [170]Rise of Kunark, with a new playable race (Sarnak), new starting
   city, and a level cap of 80.^[171][7]

[[172]edit] Alternate versions

     * [173]EverQuest II: East was created for the East Asian market
       ([174]mainland China, [175]Taiwan, [176]South Korea) but it was
       terminated as a separate edition on 29 March 2006. EverQuest II:
       East players were moved to standard servers. The special character
       models created for the game had already been included in the
       standard edition as a client-side option since 2005.
