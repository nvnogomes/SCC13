[[33]edit] Summary

   Doc follows rural doctor Clint "Doc" Cassidy who has taken a position
   at Westbury Clinic, a small medical center in New York City. Doc is a
   young [34]Christian [35]bachelor from the mountains of [36]Montana, who
   brings his small-town values and ideology to an environment that seems
   to lack familiarity with them.

   Supporting characters include the doctors, nurses and other staff of
   Westbury Clinic; a 10-year-old orphan, Ral Garca; and a young couple,
   Nate and Beverly Jackson, who live in the same apartment building as
   Clint.

[[37]edit] Broadcast history

   The show was broadcast on [38]PAX TV (now [39]ION Television) and had
   strong [40]Christian undertones. It was written by Dave Alan Johnson
   and Gary R. Johnson. The producers and writers were also involved with
   the series [41]Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye.

   It was rebroadcast throughout 2005 on [42]Network Ten in Australia on
   Saturday mornings at 4:00am.

   During 2006, Doc was shown on the Canadian [43]Showcase cable
   television specialty channel, Monday through Friday at 10:00am and
   6:00pm. It also aired in Spanish on Mexico's National Broadcast channel
   at 10:30PM Sunday through Friday.

   Showcase has also purchased 14 episodes for 2007, and depending on
   their success, Showcase is considering buying more.^[[44]citation

   ION Television resumed airing Doc reruns October 1st, 2007 -- only to
   take it off the air again November 16, 2007.

[[45]edit] Major characters

[[46]edit] Westbury Clinic

     * [47]Billy Ray Cyrus plays Dr. Clint 'Doc' Cassidy (2001-2004) - a
       kindhearted doctor from Montana who has moved to New York to work
       at Westbury Clinic, a medical center adjacent to the local
       hospital. Doc has a love for God and for people, making him a
       popular doctor at the clinic. He often likes to insert little bits
       of wisdom from Montana into the clinic team's activity. He is the
       show's main character.

     * [48]Andrea C. Robinson plays Nurse Nancy Nichols (2001-2004) - a
       young nurse who is smart, witty, and a little bit vain. She
       possesses good bedside manners and common sense. She isn't afraid
       to speak her mind. Nancy's parents divorced when she was twelve,
       and Nancy had a touching reunion with her mother, who had cancer at
       the time. This reunion, and the mother eventually succumbing to her
       cancer were the focuses of two episodes of the shows.

     * [49]Derek McGrath plays Dr. Derek Hebert (2001-2004) - a slightly
       overweight, excitable, but insightful doctor who is a very good
       friend of Clint's. Despite his soft spoken personality, Derek is
       friends with all of the clinical team (with the exception of Dr.
       Crane) and never afraid to get involved in anything the clinic is
       involved in. Derek has a wife, Nellie, and a child, Gracie. He has
       a phobia of small [50]rodents, especially [51]rats and [52]mice.

     * [53]Ruth Marshall plays Donna Dewitt (2001-2004) - Ms. Dewitt is
       the hospital administrator. Ms. Dewitt combines a warm heart with a
       focus on the bottom line. Her occasional role as an antagonist as a
       result of her goal of cutting costs contrasts with her warmth,
       approachability and unfailing miley cyrus 1234 roxs* [54]Ron Lea
       plays Dr. Oliver Crane (2001-2004) - Dr. Crane is frequently the
       antagonist of the series. He is egotistical and selfish, and
       usually more concerned with his personal convenience and getting
       recognition from peers (especially outside of the clinic) than with
       his patients. He is also a schemer in a sense, trying to get money
       and compliments, but these almost always fail. But despite his mean
       and outspoken demeanor, Oliver has a soft side, which was revealed
       in the episode in which Nellie was pregnant with Gracie.

     * [55]Paula Boudreau plays Tippy Williams (later Tippy Doss)
       (2002-2004). Tippy appears in the pilot episode, and joins Westbury
       later in the first season. She thinks differently than most people,
       and often comes across as a bit of a dimwit. She keeps the team on
       their toes in a silly, geeky way. However, shining through Tippy's
       somewhat woolly mind is a heart of gold that loves, sacrifices, and
       longs to learn.

[[56]edit] Jackson Family

     * [57]Richard Leacock plays Nate Jackson (2001-2004), an officer with
       the New York Police Department. Nate Jackson is initially skeptical
       of Clint's country ways, but the two become close friends quickly.
       Nate is also a building supervisor, and arranges an apartment for
       Clint.
     * [58]Tyler Posey - Raul Garcia (2001-2004)
     * [59]Tracy Shreve - Beverly Jackson (2001-2004)

[[60]edit] Guest stars

     * Actress [61]Kim Poirier guest starred in the episode Second Time
       Around as Denise.
     * Singer [62]Jaci Velasquez appears in the season 5 episode Nip, Tuck
       & Die.
     * Cyrus' daughter, [63]Miley Cyrus, appeared as Kylie in a season two
       episode and then again in a season four episode as Raul's friend.
     * Christian singer [64]Steven Curtis Chapman appears in the season 2
       episode Fearless, as Raul's music teacher, Daniel Parson.
     * Cyrus' daughter, [65]Noah Lindsey Cyrus, appeared in six episodes
       as Gracie Hebert.
     * [66]CeCe Winans

[[67]edit] Reactions

     * [68]Focus on the Family declared that "Doc has restored families
       hope that there are still TV programs they can watch
       together."[69][1]
     * [70]Parents Television Council declared "Episodes of Doc
       consistently reinforce family-friendly themes such as honesty,
       compassion, hope, and reconciliation, making it a perfect fit for
       its family-hour time slot."[71][2] Doc was also named the best show
       on TV in their 2001-2002 Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Network
       TV.[72][3]
