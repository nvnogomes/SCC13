   Captain Edward Rotheram [27]CB [28]RN (27 December 1753 6 November
   1830) was a senior officer of the British [29]Royal Navy, who served
   for many years during the [30]American War of Independence, [31]French
   Revolutionary War and [32]Napoleonic Wars. During his service, Rotheram
   saw action at several major naval engagements, including as a
   lieutenant at the [33]Glorious First of June in 1794 and as captain of
   [34]HMS Royal Sovereign at the [35]Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.
   Although he was highly praised for his actions at both battles, he was
   not well regarded in the service, being once described by his admiral
   at Trafalgar, [36]Cuthbert Collingwood as "a man of no talent as a sea
   officer" and "a stupid man".

   Rotheram gained a reputation as an difficult officer to serve with, and
   he rapidly alienated his fellow officers and the sailors who served
   under him. Ultimately this character trait resulted in his removal from
   service and overlooking for promotion in 1808 after being court
   martialled for inappropriate behaviour towards junior officers. The
   rest of his life was spent requesting, often in an aggressive manner,
   the [37]Admiralty for both further service and the rewards he felt were
   his due.

[[44]edit] Early career

   Rotheram was born in 1753 at [45]Hexham in [46]Northumberland to Dr.
   John Rotheram, a local physician, and his wife Catherine Roberts.
   Rotheram was the second of the couple's seven children and was
   educated, with his brothers, at [47]Head School in
   [48]Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, where the family moved when Edward was
   seven.^[49][1] His elder brother [50]John Rotheram was later a senior
   professor in natural philosophy at [51]St Andrew's University. Edward
   Rotheram went to sea at a young age, joining a [52]collier sailing from
   [53]Newcastle and serving aboard merchant ships for several
   years.^[54][2] In 1777 however, Rotheram joined the Royal Navy as a
   [55]midshipman during the [56]American Revolutionary War.

   Initially serving on [57]HMS Centaur, Rotheram moved to [58]HMS
   Barfleur in 1780 and [59]HMS Monarch shortly afterwards as a
   lieutenant, serving under [60]Lord Howe.^[61][2] Monarch was heavily
   engaged in the West Indian campaign during the latter stages of the
   war, and Rotheram saw action at the [62]Battle of Martinique in 1780,
   the [63]Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781 and the [64]Battle of St Kitts
   and the [65]Battle of the Saintes in 1782. Following the end of the war
   at the start of 1783, Rotheram returned to Britain as a reserve officer
   on half-pay.^[66][1]

[[67]edit] lieutenant and commander

   In 1785, Rotheram married Dorothy Harle of Newcastle, with whom he had
   three daughters. He returned to naval service in 1787 aboard [68]HMS
   Bombay Castle and over the next four years moved between [69]HMS
   Culloden and [70]HMS Vengeance, all in the [71]Channel Fleet. In 1792
   Rotheram was made first lieutenant of HMS Culloden and was still in
   this position when the [72]French Revolutionary War broke out a year
   later.^[73][3] Culloden was part of the Channel Fleet under Rotheram's
   old commander Lord Howe, and the ship was captained by [74]Isaac
   Schomberg during the [75]Atlantic campaign of May 1794, in which Howe
   pursued a French fleet deep into the Atlantic, bringing it to battle at
   the [76]Glorious First of June.^[77][1]

   Culloden was not closely engaged in the opening stages of the battle,
   for which Schomberg would later be heavily criticised.^[78][4]
   Rotheram, however, gained acclaim in the battle's aftermath by
   organising the Culloden's boats and the boats of other nearby ships
   into a rescue party that saved hundreds of French sailors from the
   sinking [79]Vengeur du Peuple. In recognition for this operation,
   Rotheram was promoted [80]commander on 6 July 1794 and given command of
   the storeship [81]HMS Camel in the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1797
   Rotheram moved to the sloop [82]HMS Hawke, which he commanded in the
   West Indies until 1800, returning to Britain in 1800 aboard [83]HMS
   Lapwing to be made a [84]post captain.^[85][1]

   Rotheram commanded Lapwing for the next two years, operating with the
   Channel Fleet and capturing several small French [86]prizes.^[87][5] In
   1802 Rotheram returned to reserve ashore during the [88]Peace of
   Amiens. This retirement lasted until 1804, when Rotheram was called
   back to service as flag captain of [89]HMS Dreadnought, a [90]second
   rate [91]ship of the line that flew the flag of Vice-Admiral
   [92]Cuthbert Collingwood. Collingwood and Rotheram had a poor
   relationship, Collingwood commenting by letter to his brother that "He
   [Rotheram] is a man of no talent as a sea officer, and of little
   assistance to me."^[93][1] Nevertheless, when Collingwood moved to
   [94]HMS Royal Sovereign in October 1805 as second-in-command of the
   fleet under [95]Lord Nelson blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet in
   [96]Cadiz, he brought Rotheram with him.^[97][6] Nelson was aware of
   the personal conflict between the men, and invited both Collingwood and
   Rotheram to dinner in a partially successful effort to reconcile
   them.^[98][2]

[[99]edit] Trafalgar

   Admiral Collingwood, Rotheram's commander at Trafalgar, who considered
   his subordinate "stupid"

   At the [100]Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, Royal Sovereign was
   the first ship in Collingwood's division to breach the enemy lines, and
   Collingwood and Rotheram appear to have reconciled some of their
   differences as they cooperated well in handling the ship. Collingwood
   even called to his captain; "Rotheram, what would Nelson give to be
   here!", Nelson's [101]HMS Victory being several minutes behind Royal
   Sovereign in engaging the enemy.^[102][2] Rotheram was also noted
   during the action for refusing to remove his full dress uniform and
   large cocked hat, apparel which was not only impractical in a naval
   engagement but which also marked him as a target for enemy
   snipers.^[103][2]

   Royal Sovereign's main opponent was the large Spanish [104]first rate
   [105]Santa Ana, with whom she was engaged for several minutes at the
   start of the action without support. During this time, Royal Sovereign
   was at one point engaged with five different enemy ships, and suffered
   heavy damage and casualties during the engagement, finally subduing the
   112-gun Santa Ana after a duel lasting several hours. Both ships were
   left unmanageable at the end of the engagement, Royal Sovereign being
   taken in tow by [106]HMS Euryalus into which Collingwood transferred
   his flag. Royal Sovereign had suffered nearly 150 casualties, Santa Ana
   over 300 by the end of the battle. Santa Ana was later abandoned by her
   captors and ultimately fell back into Spanish hands, but Royal
   Sovereign reached the safety of [107]Gibraltar soon after the
   battle.^[108][2]

   In the aftermath of the action, Rotheram left Royal Sovereign to take
   command of [109]HMS Bellerophon, whose captain [110]John Cooke had been
   killed by a French sniper. Cooke had been targeted due to the dress
   uniform he had worn during the battle.^[111][7] Bellerophon escorted
   Victory carrying Nelson's body back to Britain, and Rotheram carried
   the [112]guidon behind the coffin at Nelson's funeral in
   [113]London.^[114][8] Rotheram was presented with a gold medal and
   sword of honour in recognition of his services in the action, and
   continued in command of Bellerophon.

[[115]edit] Retirement

   Rotheram remained in command of Bellerophon in the [116]English Channel
   and the [117]North Sea until 1808, when he was court martialled and
   reprimanded for unacceptable conduct towards his ship's junior officers
   and chaplain. Rotheram remained in the service, but was never again
   employed at sea. Collingwood summed the situation up in a letter to his
   sister, stating "Though I think him a stupid man I was in hope he might
   have gone on in the ship I put him in, which I believe was the only
   chance he had of being in a ship".^[118][1]

   Although his career was over, Rotheram continued to request sea service
   and honours from the [119]Admiralty, becoming increasingly irate and
   intemperate in his demands.^[120][1] At the reorganising of the
   knightly orders in 1815, a number of senior naval officers were given
   knighthoods, Rotheram settling for being made a [121]Companion of the
   Order of the Bath, a step below knighthood.^[122][9] He retired to
   [123]Bildeston in [124]Suffolk and from there continued to request
   appointments, finally being made one of the captains of the
   [125]Greenwich Naval Hospital in 1828.^[126][2] Rotheram died in
   Bildeston in 1830 and was buried in St Mary Magdelene Church in the
   village, where his grave and a memorial plaque are still legible
   today.^[127][10] Rotheram was never awarded any further honours or
   promoted to admiral, having lost his seniority in the court martial of
   1808.^[128][1]
