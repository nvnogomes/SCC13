Don't Let's Start

   For the EP by this name, see [9]Don't Let's Start (EP).

   "Don't Let's Start" is a [10]They Might Be Giants song originally from
   the self-titled [11]They Might Be Giants [12]album. It was released as
   a single ([13]Don't Let's Start (EP)) at this time. It has also
   appeared on [14]Then: The Earlier Years and [15]Dial-A-Song: 20 Years
   Of They Might Be Giants.

   Its lyrics are typically abstract for an early They Might Be Giants
   song, though its musings on [16]love and [17]life appear to stem from
   an impending romantic turmoil suggested in the chorus. Although the
   song is known for such dreary, pointed statements as "everybody dies
   frustrated and sad, and that is beautiful," [18]John Linnell has
   repeatedly insisted (as in a 2003 interview with [19]NPR's [20]Terry
   Gross) that some of its lyrical twists, though pondered extensively by
   fans, were constructed merely to complement the melody and have no deep
   meaning.

   The song also led to a [21]music video that was popular for some time
   on [22]MTV. In it, the band is featured wearing rolled up cardboard
   with fabric stapled to the outside on their heads. The location in
   which the video was filmed is the site of the [23]1964 New York World's
   Fair in [24]Queens, which would later be mentioned in "[25]Ana Ng". The
   face used in the video is that of [26]William Allen White. His face has
   also been used for props at TMBG [27]concerts. It appears on the
   [28]Don't Let's Start [29]CD single, and otherwise can frequently be
   found associated with TMBG.

   The song was covered by the band [30]Common Rotation on their album
   [31]The Big Fear, and is quoted by [32]Jimmy Eat World in "A Praise
   Chorus" on their 2001 CD, [33]Bleed American.

   When asked about the meaning of the song, Linnell replied that it was
   about "not let's starting".

   Don't Let's Start is also the name of an upcoming Film, with characters
   that take their names from various [34]They Might Be Giants' songs,
   such as [35]Ana Ng.
