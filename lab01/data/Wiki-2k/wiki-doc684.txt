   The Eagle-Tribune (and Sunday Eagle-Tribune) is a seven-day morning
   [17]daily newspaper covering the [18]Merrimack Valley and [19]Essex
   County, Massachusetts, and southern [20]New Hampshire. It is the
   largest-circulation daily newspaper owned by [21]Community Newspaper
   Holdings Inc., and the lead property in a regional chain of four
   dailies and several [22]weekly newspapers in Essex County and southern
   New Hampshire.

   Although The Eagle-Tribune is historically tied to [23]Lawrence,
   Massachusetts, the largest city in its circulation area, it has been
   based since the 1960s in suburban [24]North Andover, Massachusetts, and
   has not included "Lawrence" in its nameplate since the late
   1980s.^[25][2]

[[31]edit] Awards

   During the late 1980s, The Eagle-Tribune ran nearly 200 articles on
   [32]Michael Dukakis and the Massachusetts prison [33]furlough program.
   The series was widely credited for ending furlough for first-degree
   murderers in Massachusetts, and was awarded a [34]Pulitzer
   Prize.^[35][3] The paper won another Pulitzer in 2003 for its coverage
   of the drowning deaths of four [36]Lawrence boys in the [37]Merrimack
   River.^[38][4]

   In the late 1980s through the 1990s, The Eagle-Tribune was consistently
   named New England Newspaper of the Year and earned a reputation for
   quality journalism.^[39][5]

[[40]edit] History

   Before its 2005 sale to CNHI, The Eagle-Tribune and its predecessors
   had been owned by the Rogers family for more than 100 years, dating
   back to the purchase of the Lawrence Daily Eagle (founded as a morning
   paper in 1868) and Evening Tribune (founded in Lawrence in 1890) by
   Eagle reporter Alexander H. Rogers in 1898.^[41][6]

   Rogers passed the role of publisher to his son, Irving E. Rogers Sr.,
   in 1942; he passed it along to his son, Irving Jr., [42]40 years
   later.^[43][5] After his death in 1998, the fourth and last generation
   of Rogers owners took over, in the person of Irving E. "Chip" Rogers
   III.

   During the first Irving Rogers' tenure, the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune was
   founded in 1959 by finally merging the company's two newspapers into
   one afternoon paper. Irving Rogers Sr. was also the publisher who moved
   the company to new headquarters in North Andover.^[44][6]

   During Rogers family ownership, the paper dropped "Lawrence" from its
   nameplate. Later, the family further abandoned the city by removing the
   bodies of deceased members of the family from graves in Lawrence to
   graves in Andover.

   Former Lawrence Mayor John J. Buckley, in 1990, lauded The
   Eagle-Tribune for helping the city bounce back from the closure of
   several mills in the 1950s. He said the paper championed economic
   redevelopment in its editorials and news articles, and persuaded
   companies such as [45]Avco, [46]Honeywell and [47]Raytheon to open
   plants in Lawrence.^[48][7]

   In 2005, the Rogers family, which had owned The Eagle-Tribune for
   generations, sold the newspaper and its subsidiaries -- including three
   other [49]Massachusetts dailies and several weeklies -- to
   [50]Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc. of Alabama, for an undisclosed
   amount of money. Rogers initially stayed on as publisher, but was
   replaced as publisher within a month of the takeover.^[51][8]

   The paper went through a minor labor dispute in January 2006, after
   several staff members attempted to start a [52]union. As part of a move
   to beef up The Eagle-Tribune's presence in [53]New Hampshire, the paper
   reassigned several staff members to a satellite bureau in [54]Derry,
   New Hampshire -- days after a union vote. Some of the workers said they
   were being punished for being on a union organizing committee; they
   said other members of the committee were switched to less desirable
   night beats. Spokesmen for CNHI said the moves were unrelated to the
   union vote, which failed.^[55][9]

   March 2006 brought the daily paper's conversion from an afternoon to a
   morning newspaper. Since some home delivery subscribers may not get
   their paper until 8-830am (after they leave for work), those people
   still believe it is an afternoon paper.

[[56]edit] Subsidiaries

   As part of the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune's push into the suburbs -- a move
   which has left some bitterness in the city^[57][2] -- the paper has
   acquired several [58]weekly newspapers within and bordering its
   coverage area.

   Weeklies published within the paper's circulation area by Eagle-Tribune
   Publishing Company include the Andover Townsman, circulating 6,900
   copies per week in [59]Andover; the Haverhill Gazette, 6,400 in
   [60]Haverhill; and Town Crossings, 14,700 in [61]Boxford and [62]North
   Andover.^[63][10]

   Bordering The Eagle-Tribune's circulation area in southern [64]New
   Hampshire, the company publishes the Carriage Towne News in [65]Exeter
   and nine other towns; and the weekly Derry News in [66]Derry and five
   other towns.^[67][10]

   In 2002, the paper made its largest acquisition, scooping up some of
   its chief daily competitors for [68]US$70 million. The purchase of the
   Essex County Newspapers chain from [69]Ottaway Community Newspapers, a
   division of [70]Dow Jones & Company, brought three neighboring
   afternoon dailies into the fold: the [71]Gloucester Daily Times,
   [72]The Daily News of Newburyport and [73]The Salem Evening News.
   Eagle-Tribune executives touted the creation of a regional news
   organization; they also laid off some 45 staffers at the Essex County
   papers, including the editors of the Newburyport and Salem
   papers.^[74][11]

   Since then, the four dailies and the weeklies have made several
   cost-saving consolidations, cutting down to one printing facility and
   combining advertising staffs. In 2005, the company employed 700 and
   reached 341,000 readers in 55 communities, according a
   spokesman.^[75][2] In September, 2008, the company fired 52 employees
   in a cost-cutting move.

   With its acquisition of the Eagle-Tribune, CNHI also assumed a 49
   percent stake in Costa-Eagle Radio Ventures Ltd. and its three radio
   stations, [76]WCCM, [77]WCEC (formerly [78]WHAV) and WNNW. Continuing
   its deemphasis of its home town, the company moved WCCM, a long-time
   Lawrence radio station to a smaller signal in Haverhill and then to its
   smallest signal in Salem, N.H. The former owners of the Eagle-Tribune
   created Cambridge Acquisitions, Inc. during the fall of 1994 to hold
   the minority stake, according to the Secretary of the Commonwealth,
   Corporations Division.^[79][12]
