   Double-headed eagle emblem of the [9]Ecumenical Patriarchate of
   Constantinople ([10]Istanbul), based on insignia of the [11]Byzantine
   Empire. The head on the left (West) symbolizes [12]Rome, the head on
   the right (East) symbolizes [13]Constantinople. The cross and [14]orb
   in the claws symbolize, respectively, spiritual and secular authority.

   see [15]Double Eagle.

   The double-headed eagle is a common symbol in [16]heraldry and
   [17]vexillology. It is most commonly associated with the [18]Holy Roman
   Empire and with the [19]Byzantine Empire. In Byzantine heraldry, the
   heads represent the dual sovereignty of the Emperor (secular and
   religious) and/or dominance of the [20]Byzantine Emperors over [21]both
   East and West. Several Eastern European nations adopted it from the
   Byzantines and continue to use it as their national symbol to this day,
   the most prominent being [22]Russia. However, the design was in use in
   the East for centuries before it was officially adopted by the
   Byzantines, and was independently adopted as the symbol of several
   other historical states, such as early [23]medieval Armenia and the
   [24]Seljuk Sultanate of Rm^[[25]citation needed].

   The two-headed eagle appears on the [26]coat of arms of the following
   countries and territories:
     * [27]Albania (see [28]Coat of arms of Albania)
     * [29]Armenia (see [30]Coat of arms of Armenia)

[[73]edit] Origins

   Double-headed eagles have been present in imagery for many centuries.
   The two-headed eagle can be found in [74]archaeological remains of the
   [75]Hittite civilization dating from a period that ranges from the 20th
   century BC to the 13th century BC.

   Cylindric seals discovered in [76]Bogazkoy, an old [77]Hittite capital
   in modern-day [78]Turkey, represent clearly a two-headed eagle with
   spread wings. The aesthetics of this symmetrical position explains in
   part the birth of this religious figure. It probably dates from the
   18th century BC, and was used in a tradesman background. It can also be
   seen in the same region in two monumental settings: in [79]Alacahyk
   around 1400 BC and in [80]Yazilikaya before 1250 BC. Here the context
   looks different and totally religious: the eagle becomes a divinity
   symbol. The two-headed eagle slowly disappears during the last
   [81]Hittite period, from the 9th century BC to the 7th century BC, and
   totally disappears after the end of the empire.

   The double-headed eagle was also in use by the [82]Arsacid Dynasty of
   Armenia and the [83]Mamikonian family^[84][1] in the 3rd to 9th
   centuries.

[[85]edit] Byzantine Empire

   Further information: [86]Byzantine heraldry
   Double-headed eagle in [87]Mystras, adopted by Byzantine Emperor
   [88]Michael VIII Palaeologus c. 1263
   Example of the use of the double-headed eagle on imperial vestments of
   [89]Theodora Kantakouzene, daughter of Byzantine Sevastokrator
   Nikephoros Kantakouzenos and empress consort of emperor [90]Alexios III
   of Trebizond. From a [91]Golden Bull of Alexios III of Trebizond,
   mid-14th century.

   [92]Constantinople was the successor of Rome, and the Byzantines
   continued the use of the old imperial "single-headed" eagle motif.
   Although the roots of the transformation to double-headed are almost
   certainly connected with old depictions in Asia Minor, the details of
   its adoption are uncertain. It was, however, used in already during the
   first centuries AD and certainly before the 10th century AD by
   Armenians and Persians, appearing in their art (see above).

   According to the most prevalent theory of the double-headed eagle's use
   in Byzantine Empire, the [93]imperial Roman single-headed eagle was
   modified to double-headed by emperor [94]Isaakios Komnenos (1057-1059)
   being influenced from local traditions about such a beast (the haga) in
   his native Paphlagonia in Asia Minor. Local legends talked about this
   giant eagle with two heads that could easily hold a bull in its claws;
   the haga was seen as a representation of power, and people would often
   "call" it for protection. Isaakios Komnenos, deeply influenced by these
   beliefs, had already used it as a family emblem ^[95][2]. As there has
   been reference to "stone representations" of the eagle that were the
   inspiration for its picture, it is reasonable to assume that
   [96]Hittite carvings may have been the sources of the myths themselves,
   but other relevant artwork cannot be excluded as such a source. Whether
   the eagle became an "imperial" symbol or remained purely a personal
   symbol for Komnenos, is not clear.

   It is noteworthy that originally Roman armies used no flags. Instead,
   [97]bronze Aquilas and [98]vexilloids [99][3] and, if the emperor was
   present, pikes or banners with the [100]emperor's portrait were used.
   With the adaption of [101]Christianity as religion, and especially
   during the later Empire, single-headed eagles were fielded together
   [102]labarum symbol, crosses and banners, embroidered with the
   emperor's portrait, were additionally adorned with crosses and other
   Christian symbols. It is possible that, after the Byzantines
   encountered Western knights and armies during the [103]First Crusade,
   they observed the [104]heraldic use of various emblems and attempted to
   emulate it later.

   After the [105]Latin conquest of Constantinople in 1204, the Byzantine
   double-headed eagle was used by the successor states of [106]Epirus and
   [107]Nicaea. [108]Theodore II Laskaris chose it for his symbol as
   Emperor ([109]Empire of Nicaea), taking it to symbolize his state's
   claims to all the Byzantine Empire's former domains, both European
   (West) and Asian (East). An alternative (and probably more correct)
   interpretation is that the eagle symbolized the Emperor's double
   temporal and spiritual sovereignty.

   After the recapture of Constantinople and the restoration of the
   [110]Byzantine Empire, the symbol was used as an emblem of the imperial
   family, but it is uncertain whether it was the official emblem of the
   Empire. More recent research has suggested that it was not, its usage
   being limited to imperial seals and other personal or dynasty symbols
   such as imperial robes, although there has been no depiction of any
   Emperor wearing it. The role of "state" symbols was most probably
   played by flags with the cross. In Byzantine usage, the eagle was
   almost always connected with colors of imperial power (gold and
   purple). A black eagle on golden background was used outside the
   imperial family, denoting the subordinate position (the eagle was black
   as being the 'shadow' of the Emperor's golden eagle) of their bearers.

   (June 2008)

   The double-headed eagle became the standard of the [117]Seljuk Turks
   with the crowning of [118]Toghrl (meaning "Eagle") Beg at [119]Mosul in
   1058 as "King of the East and the West" and was much used
   afterwards^[[120]citation needed]. The Sultans of [121]Rum, Ala ad-Din
   [122]Kayqubad I (1220-1237) and his son [123]Kaykhusraw II (1237-1246)
   used the bicephalous eagle in their standards^[[124]citation needed],
   and the motif was also found on tissues, cut stones, mural squares, and
   [125]Koran holders.^[126][3]

   [127]Turcomans who ruled in Anatolia during the 13th century, inherited
   it from the Seljuk Turks. Islamic coins from the reign of Khalif
   Nasreddin Mahmoud bin Mohammad, following Turkish influence, sport a
   double-headed eagle on one side and the [128]Star of David on the other
   as early as year 1200.

   Today, the [129]Turkish Police have a double-headed eagle in its
   insignia as a secondary charge.

[[130]edit] Holy Roman Empire

   The double-headed eagle of the [131]Holy Roman Empire, c. 1510

   The first mention of a double-headed eagle in the West dates from 1250,
   in a roll of arms of Matthew of Paris for Emperor [132]Frederick II of
   the [133]Holy Roman Empire. Usually depicted black on a gold
   background, it replaced the earlier single-headed eagle, and was
   subsequently adopted in the coats of arms of many German cities and
   aristocratic families. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire
   in 1806, the double-headed eagle was retained by the [134]Austrian
   Empire, and served also as the coat of arms of the [135]German
   Confederation.

[[136]edit] Use by other countries

   Russian [137]coa 1472. The first double-headed eagle-based Russian coat
   of arms adopted from Byzantine by [138]Ivan III after his marriage.

   Petersburg.

   From Byzantium, two-headed eagles spread to [142]Russia after [143]Ivan
   III's marriage to [144]Zoe Palaeologina, ^[145][4] and to
   [146]Montferrat, where a [147]cadet branch of the Palaeologi ruled. It
   was the [148]charge in the Coat of Arms of the [149]Bulgarian [150]Tsar
   [151]Ivan Alexander (reigned 1331-1371). The [152]Serbian [153]Nemanji
   dynasty adopted a white version as their own to signify their own
   independence of, and indeed, claim to the imperial throne of
   Constantinople. The white eagle was retained by most Serbian medieval
   dynasties, as well as the [154]Karaorevi, [155]Obrenovi and
   [156]Petrovi-Njego houses and remains to this day in use in the
   coat-of-arms of the countries of [157]Serbia and [158]Montenegro.
   George Kastrioti ([159]Skanderbeg) adopted a similar flag in his
   struggle against the [160]Ottomans, consisting of a black eagle on red
   background, which has been resurrected in the current [161]Flag of
   Albania. During the next centuries, the eagle was made to hold a sword
   and/or a [162]sceptre and an [163]orb with a cross, symbols of the
   aforementioned double sovereignty.

   Its usage also survived as a decorative element in the [164]Greek
   Orthodox Church, which was the inheritor of the Byzantine legacy during
   the [165]Ottoman Empire, while it remained a popular symbol among
   Greeks. In modern Greece various variations of the two-headed eagles
   are used in Church flags (based on Byzantine flag patterns) and,
   officially, by the Greek Army (Coat of Arms of Hellenic Army General
   Staff). The bird found its way into the Greek coat of arms for a brief
   period in 1925-1926. ^[166][5]

   It remains also an important motif in the heraldry of the imperial
   families of Russia (the House of [167]Romanov) and [168]Austria-Hungary
   (the House of [169]Habsburg), as well as the royal family of Montenegro
   (the [170]House of Petrovic).

   The Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash is used as emblem by the
   [173]Scottish Rite of [174]Freemasonry[175][4]. While there are many
   meanings attached to this symbol, [176][5] author [177]M. P. Hall who
   wrote many works on the subject, suggested it an alchemical symbol of
   the union between the masculine and feminine principles in the
   individual.

[[181]edit] Use in fiction

     * In the world of [182]Warhammer 40,000, the double-headed eagle
       forms the crest of the [183]Imperium of Man, earning it
       considerable religious and cultural significance. For this reason,
       it is not too uncommon to create actual double-headed eagles
       through surgery, mechanical proxy or genetic manipulation. When
       these are used to aid the abilities of a [184]psyker, they are
       known as psyber-eagles. The [185]Emperor of Mankind is known to be
       from central [186]Anatolia (currently [187]Turkey), so it may be a
       reference to his geographic origins.

     * In [188]Namco's game, [189]Tales of Symphonia, Aska, a golden,
       twin-headed bird who is one of the two Summon Spirits of Light is
       thought to have been inspired by the two-headed eagle.In
       [190]Ragnarok Online the double-headed eagle appears ins many flags
       and buildings of the city of [191]Prontera.

     * In [192]The Mouse That Roared and its sequels, the double-headed
       eagle is on the national flag of [193]Grand Fenwick.

     * In [194]The Nightly News, a six-issue comic book mini-series by
       [195]Jonathan Hickman (published by [196]Image Comics), the
       Brotherhood of The Voice uses a double-headed eagle as one of their
       symbols.

     * In the anime [197]Beyblade, Claude from [198]Barthez Battalion has
       a beyblade with the bit beast Rapid Eagle which is a two headed
       eagle.

     * A [199]roc appeared as a double-headed eagle in the film
       [200]Sinbad's Seventh Voyage.

[[201]edit] Use in sports

   The double-headed eagle is the emblem of the Greek sport clubs [202]AEK
   (black eagle on yellow background) and [203]PAOK (black eagle on white
   background). It is a symbol of the clubs' origins, since both clubs
   were founded by [204]Greeks who fled to [205]Greece from
   [206]Constantinople in 1922-23. It is also the emblem of the Turkish
   [207]Konyaspor [208][6],the Dutch N.E.C. Nijmegen and the English
   non-League football club AFC Wimbledon.
