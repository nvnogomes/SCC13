   Founded in 1786, Knoxville is the third-largest city in the U.S. state
   of [46]Tennessee, behind [47]Memphis and [48]Nashville, and is the
   [49]county seat of [50]Knox County^[51][6]. It is also the largest city
   in [52]East Tennessee. As of the 2000 United States Census, Knoxville
   had a total population of 173,890;^[53][3] the July 2007 estimated
   population was 183,546^[54][7] Knoxville is the principal city of the
   "[55]Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area" with a metro population

[[91]edit] Overview

   Of Tennessee's four major cities, Knoxville is second oldest to
   [92]Nashville which was founded in 1779. After Tennessee's admission
   into the Union in 1796, Knoxville was the state's first capital, in
   which capacity it served until 1819, when the capital was moved to
   [93]Murfreesboro, prior to Nashville receiving the designation. The
   city was named in honor of the first [94]Secretary of War, [95]Henry
   Knox.

   One of Knoxville's nicknames is The Marble City.^[96][8] In the early
   20th century, a number of quarries were active in the city, supplying
   Tennessee pink [97]marble (actually [98]Ordovician [99]limestone of the
   [100]Holston Formation) to much of the country. Notable buildings such
   as the [101]National Gallery of Art in [102]Washington are constructed
   of Knoxville marble. The National Gallery's fountains were turned by
   Candoro Marble Company, which once ran the largest marble lathes in the
   United States.

   Knoxville was once also known as the Underwear Capital of the
   World.^[103][9] In the 1930s, no fewer than 20 textile and clothing
   mills operated in Knoxville, and the industry was the city's largest
   employer. In the 1950s, the mills began to close, causing an overall
   population loss of 10% by 1960.

   Knoxville is also the home of the [104]University of Tennessee's
   primary campus. The university's sports teams, called the "Volunteers"
   or "Vols", are extremely popular in the surrounding area. In
   recognition of this popularity, the telephone [105]area code for Knox
   County and eight adjacent counties is [106]865 (VOL). Knoxville is also
   the home of the [107]Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, almost entirely
   thanks to the popularity of [108]Pat Summitt and the [109]University of
   Tennessee women's basketball team.

[[110]edit] History

[[111]edit] Early history

   The first humans to form substantial settlements in what is now
   Knoxville arrived during the [112]Woodland period (c. 1000 B.C. 1000
   A.D).^[113][10] One of the oldest man-made structures in Knoxville is a
   burial mound constructed during the early [114]Mississippian period (c.
   1000 A.D.). The mound is located on the University of Tennessee
   campus.^[115][11] Other prehistoric sites include an Early Woodland
   habitation area at the confluence of the Tennessee River and Knob Creek
   (near the Knox-Blount county line),^[116][12] and Dallas phase
   Mississippian villages at Post Oak Island (also along the river near
   the Knox-Blount line),^[117][13] and at Bussell Island (at the mouth of
   the [118]Little Tennessee River near Lenoir City).^[119][14]

   By the 18th century, the [120]Cherokee had become the dominant tribe in
   the East Tennessee region, although they were consistently at war with
   the [121]Creeks and [122]Shawnee.^[123][15]^[124][16] The Cherokee
   people called the Knoxville area kuwanda'talun'yi, which means
   "Mulberry Place."^[125][17] Most Cherokee habitation in the area was
   concentrated in the [126]Overhill settlements along the [127]Little
   Tennessee River, southwest of Knoxville.

   The first Euro-American traders and explorers arrived in the Tennessee
   Valley in the late 1600s, although there is significant evidence that
   [128]Hernando de Soto visited the Bussell Island site in
   1540.^[129][18] The first major recorded Euro-American presence in the
   Knoxville area was the [130]Henry Timberlake expedition, which passed
   through the confluence of the Holston and French Broad into the
   Tennessee River in December 1761. Timberlake, who was en route to the
   Overhill settlements along the Little Tennessee River, recalled being
   pleasantly surprised by the deep waters of the Tennessee after having
   struggled down the relatively shallow Holston for several
   weeks.^[131][19]

[[132]edit] Settlement

   The home of James White in Downtown Knoxville

   The end of the [133]French and Indian War and confusion brought about
   by the [134]American Revolution led to a drastic increase in
   Euro-American settlement west of the Appalachians.^[135][20] By the
   1780s, Euro-American settlers were already established in the Holston
   and French Broad valleys. Since the Cherokee had not ceded this land,
   however, most of these settlers were in the valley illegally. The U.S.
   Congress ordered all illegal settlers out of the valley in 1785, but
   with little success. As settlers continued to trickle into Cherokee
   lands, tensions between the settlers and the Cherokee rose
   steadily.^[136][21]

   In 1786, [137]James White, a [138]Revolutionary War officer, and his
   friend James Connor built [139]White's Fort near the mouth of First
   Creek, on land White had purchased three years earlier.^[140][22] In
   1790, White's son-in-law, Charles McClung who had arrived from
   Pennsylvania the previous year surveyed White's holdings between First
   Creek and Second Creek for the establishment of a town. McClung drew up
   64 0.5-acre (0.0020 km^2) lots, with the waterfront set aside for a
   town common, two lots were set aside for a church and cemetery, and
   four lots were set aside for a school (the school eventually chartered
   as Blount College was the basis for the University of Tennessee). That
   same year, President [141]George Washington appointed North Carolina
   surveyor [142]William Blount governor of the newly-created
   [143]Territory South of the River Ohio.

   Downtown Knoxville

   One of Blount's first tasks was to meet with the Cherokee and establish
   territorial boundaries and resolve the issue of illegal
   settlers.^[144][23] This he accomplished almost immediately with the
   [145]Treaty of Holston, which was negotiated and signed at White's Fort
   in 1791. Blount originally wanted to place the territorial capital at
   the confluence of the [146]Clinch River and Tennessee River (now
   [147]Kingston), but when the Cherokee refused to cede this land, Blount
   chose White's Fort, which McClung had surveyed the previous year.
   Blount named the new capital Knoxville after Revolutionary War general
   and Secretary of War [148]Henry Knox, who at the time was Blount's
   immediate superior.^[149][24]

   Problems immediately arose from the Holston Treaty. Blount believed
   that he had "purchased" much of what is now East Tennessee when the
   treaty was signed in 1791. However, the terms of the treaty came under
   dispute, culminating in continued violence on both sides. In 1792, 200
   Cherokee led by John Watts marched on Knoxville, and a second group of
   Cherokee attacked Cavet's Station in 1793. Both attacks were repelled
   by Knoxville settlers. Knoxville settlers attacked the Cherokee several
   times as well. When the government invited the Cherokee's chief Hanging
   Maw for negotiations in 1793, Knoxville settlers attacked the Cherokee
   against orders, killing the chief's wife. Peace was renegotiated in
   1794.^[150][25]

[[151]edit] Antebellum Knoxville

   The Craighead-Jackson House in Knoxville, built in 1818

   Knoxville served as capital of the Territory South of the River Ohio
   and as capital of Tennessee (admitted as a state in 1796) until
   1817,^[152][26] when the capital was moved to [153]Murfreesboro. Early
   Knoxville has been described as an "alternately quiet and rowdy river
   town."^[154][27] Early issues of the [155]Knoxville Gazette the first
   newspaper published in Tennessee are filled with accounts of murder,
   theft, and hostile Cherokee attacks. Abishai Thomas, a friend of
   William Blount, visited Knoxville in 1794 and wrote that while he was
   impressed by the town's modern frame buildings, the town had "seven
   taverns" and no church.^[156][28]

   Knoxville initially thrived as a way station for travelers and migrants
   heading west. Its situation at the confluence of three major rivers in
   the Tennessee Valley brought [157]flatboat and later [158]steamboat
   traffic to its waterfront in the first half of the 19th-century, and
   Knoxville quickly developed into a regional merchandising center. Local
   agricultural products especially tobacco, corn, and whiskey were traded
   for cotton, which was grown in the Deep South.^[159][29] The population
   of Knoxville more than doubled in the 1850s with the arrival of the
   East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad in 1855.^[160][27]

   Among the most prominent citizens of Knoxville during the Antebellum
   years was James White's son, [161]Hugh Lawson White (1773-1840). White
   first served as a judge and state senator before being nominated by the
   state legislature to replace [162]Andrew Jackson in the U.S. Senate in
   1825. In 1836, White ran unsuccessfully for president, representing the
   Whig Party.^[163][30]

[[164]edit] The U.S. Civil War

   Anti-slavery and anti-secession sentiment ran high in East Tennessee in
   the years leading up to the [166]U.S. Civil War. [167]William "Parson"
   Brownlow, the radical publisher of the [168]Knoxville Whig, was one of
   the region's leading anti-secessionists (although he defended the
   practice of slavery).^[169][31] Blount County, just south of Knoxville,
   had developed into a center of abolitionist activity, due in part to
   its relatively large [170]Quaker faction and the anti-slavery president
   of [171]Maryville College, Isaac Anderson.^[172][32] The [173]Greater
   Warner Tabernacle AME Zion Church, Knoxville was reportedly a station
   on the [174]underground railroad.^[175][33] Business interests,
   however, guided largely by Knoxville's trade connections with
   cotton-growing centers to the south, contributed to the development of
   a strong pro-secession movement within the city. The city's
   pro-secessionists included among their ranks Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey, a
   prominent historian whose father had built the [176]Ramsey House in
   1797. Thus, while East Tennessee and greater Knox County voted
   decisively against secession in 1861, the city of Knoxville favored
   secession by a 2-1 margin. In late May 1861, just before the secession
   vote, delegates of the [177]East Tennessee Convention met at Temperance
   Hall in Knoxville in hopes of keeping Tennessee in the [178]Union.
   After Tennessee voted to secede the following month, the convention met
   in Greeneville and attempted to create a separate Union-aligned state
   in East Tennessee.^[179][34]^[180][35]

   In July 1861, after Tennessee had joined the [181]Confederacy, General
   [182]Felix Zollicoffer arrived in Knoxville as commander of the
   District of East Tennessee. While initially lenient toward the city's
   Union sympathizers, Zollicoffer instituted martial law in November of
   that year after Union guerillas destroyed seven of the city's bridges.
   The command of the district passed briefly to [183]George Crittenden
   and then to [184]Kirby Smith, the latter of whom launched a failed
   invasion of Kentucky in August 1862. In early 1863, General [185]Simon
   Buckner took command of Confederate forces in Knoxville. Anticipating a
   Union invasion, Buckner fortified Fort Loudon (in West Knoxville, not
   to be confused with the [186]colonial fort to the southwest) and began
   constructing earthworks throughout the city. The approach of Union
   forces under [187]Ambrose Burnside in the Summer of 1863, however,
   forced Buckner to evacuate Knoxville before the earthworks were
   completed.^[188][36]

   Burnside arrived in Knoxville in early September 1863. Like the
   Confederates, he immediately began fortifying the city. The Union
   forces rebuilt Fort Loudon and erected 12 other forts and batteries
   flanked by entrenchments around the city. Burnside moved a pontoon
   bridge upstream from [189]Loudon, allowing Union forces to cross the
   river and build a series of forts along the heights of South Knoxville,
   including Fort Stanley and Fort Dickerson.^[190][37]

   As Burnside was fortifying Knoxville, the Confederate army defeated
   Union forces at the [191]Battle of Chickamauga (near the
   Tennessee-Georgia line) and subsequently laid siege to
   [192]Chattanooga. On November 3, 1863, the Confederates dispatched
   General [193]James Longstreet north to attack Burnside at Knoxville.
   Longstreet initially wanted to attack the city from the south, but
   lacking the means to carry the necessary pontoon bridges, he was forced
   to cross the river further downstream at Loudon (November 14) and march
   against the city's heavily-fortified western section. On November 15,
   General [194]Joseph Wheeler unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge Union
   forces in the heights of South Knoxville, and the following day
   Longstreet failed to cut off retreating Union forces at [195]Campbell's
   Station (now Farragut). On November 18, General [196]William P. Sanders
   was mortally wounded while conducting delaying maneuvers west of
   Knoxville, and Fort Loudon was renamed Fort Sanders in his honor. On
   November 29, after a two-week siege, the Confederates attacked Fort
   Sanders, but retreated after a fierce 20-minute engagement. On December
   4, after word of the Confederate setback at [197]Chattanooga reached
   Longstreet, Longstreet abandoned his attempts to take Knoxville and
   retreated into winter quarters at [198]Russellville. He rejoined the
   [199]Army of Northern Virginia the following Spring.^[200][38]

[[201]edit] Reconstruction and the Industrial Age

   [202]St. John's Cathedral, built in the 1890s

   After the war, northern investors such as the brothers Joeseph and
   David Richards helped Knoxville recover relatively quickly. Joseph and
   David Richards convinced 104 [203]Welsh immigrant families to migrate
   from the [204]Welsh Tract in [205]Pennsylvania to work in a rolling
   mill then co-owned by John H. Jones. These Welsh families settled in an
   area now known as [206]Mechanicsville.^[[207]citation needed] The
   Richards brothers also co-founded the Knoxville Iron Works beside the
   L&N Railroad, also employing Welsh workers. Later the site would be
   used as the grounds for the [208]1982 World's Fair.^[[209]citation
   needed]

   Other companies that sprang up during this period were Knoxville Woolen
   Mills, Dixie Cement, and Woodruff's Furniture. Between 1880 and 1887,
   97 factories were established in Knoxville, most of them specializing
   in textiles, food products, and iron products.^[210][39] By the 1890s,
   Knoxville was home to more than 50 wholesaling houses, making it the
   third largest wholesaling center by volume in the South.^[211][40] The
   Candoro Marble Works, established in the community of Vestal in 1914,
   became the nation's foremost producer of pink marble and one of the
   nation's largest marble importers.^[212][41]

   In 1869, Thomas Hughes, a Union-sympathizer and president of East
   Tennessee University, secured federal wartime restitution funding and
   state-designated Morrill Act funding to expand the college, which had
   been occupied by both armies during the war.^[213][42] In 1879, the
   school changed its name to the University of Tennessee, hoping to
   secure more funding from the Tennessee state legislature. [214]Charles
   Dabney, who became president of the university in 1887, overhauled the
   faculty and established a law school in an attempt to modernize the
   scope of the university.^[215][42]

   The post-war manufacturing boom brought thousands of immigrants to the
   city. The population of Knoxville grew from around 5,000 in 1860 to
   32,637 in 1900. West Knoxville was annexed in 1897, and over 5,000 new
   homes were built between 1895 and 1904.^[216][43]

   In 1901, train robber [217]Kid Curry (whose real name was Harvey
   Logan), a member of [218]Butch Cassidy's [219]Wild Bunch was captured
   after shooting two deputies on Knoxville's Central Avenue. He escaped
   from the Knoxville Jail and rode away on a horse stolen from the
   sheriff.^[[220]citation needed]

[[221]edit] The Progressive Era and the Great Depression

   Kingston Pike, circa 1910.

   The growing city of Knoxville hosted the Appalachian Exposition in 1910
   and again in 1911, and the [222]National Conservation Exposition in
   1913. The latter is sometimes credited with giving rise to the movement
   to create a [223]national park in the Great Smoky Mountains, some
   20 miles (32 km) south of Knoxville.^[224][44] Around this time, a
   number of affluent Knoxvillians began purchasing summer cottages in
   [225]Elkmont, and began to pursue the park idea more vigorously. They
   were led by Knoxville businessman Colonel David C. Chapman, who as head
   of the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission was largely responsible
   for raising the funds for the purchase of the property that became the
   core of the park. The [226]Great Smoky Mountains National Park opened
   in 1933.^[227][45]

   Knoxville's reliance on a manufacturing economy left it particularly
   vulnerable to the fallout from the [228]Great Depression. The Tennessee
   Valley also suffered from constant flooding, and millions of acres of
   farmland had been ruined by soil erosion. To control flooding and
   improve the economy in the Tennessee Valley, the federal government
   created the [229]Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933. Beginning with
   [230]Norris Dam, TVA constructed a series of hydroelectric and other
   power plants throughout the valley over the next few decades, bringing
   flood control, jobs, and electricity to the region.^[231][46] The
   Federal [232]Works Projects Administration, which also arrived in the
   1930s, helped to build [233]McGhee-Tyson Airport and expand
   [234]Neyland Stadium.^[235][47] TVA's headquarters, which consists of
   two twin high rises built in the 1970s, were among Knoxville's first
   modern high-rise buildings.

   In 1948, the soft drink [236]Mountain Dew was first marketed in
   Knoxville, originally designed as a mixer for [237]whiskey.[238][2]
   Around the same time, John Gunther, author of Inside USA, dubbed
   Knoxville the "ugliest city" in America. Gunther's description jolted
   the city into enacting a series of beautification measures that helped
   improve the appearance of the Downtown area.^[239][48]

[[240]edit] Modern Knoxville

   The Sterchi Lofts building dominates 'The 100 Block' in downtown
   Knoxville. Formerly Sterchi Brothers Furniture store, the building was
   vacant for many years prior to its redevelopment as rental apartments.

   Knoxville's textile and manufacturing industries largely fell victim to
   foreign competition in the 1950s and 1960s, and after the establishment
   of the [241]Interstate Highway system in the 1960s, the railroad which
   had been largely responsible for Knoxville's industrial growth began to
   decline. The rise of suburban shopping malls in the 1970s drew retail
   revenues away from Knoxville's Downtown area. While government jobs and
   economic diversification prevented widespread unemployment in
   Knoxville, the city sought to recover the massive loss of revenue by
   attempting to annex neighboring communities in Knox County. These
   annexation attempts often turned combative, and several attempts to
   merge the Knoxville and Knox County governments failed.^[242][49]

   With annexation attempts stalling, Knoxville initiated several projects
   aimed at boosting revenue in the Downtown area. The [243]1982 World's
   Fair the most successful of these projects became one of the most
   popular world's fairs in U.S. history with 11 million visitors. The
   fair's energy theme was selected due to Knoxville being the
   headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority and for the city's
   proximity to the [244]Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The
   [245]Sunsphere, a 266-foot (81 m) steel truss structure topped with a
   gold-colored glass sphere, was built for the fair and remains one of
   Knoxville's most prominent buildings.^[246][50]

   Since then, Knoxville's downtown has been developing, with the opening
   of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Knoxville Convention
   Center, redevelopment of Market Square, a new visitors center, a
   [247]regional history museum, a [248]Regal Cinemas theater, and many
   new and redeveloped [249]condominiums.^[[250]citation needed]

[[251]edit] Geography

   Southeastern view of Knoxville.

   Knoxville is located at [252]355822N 835632W / 35.97278N 83.94222W /
   35.97278; -83.94222 (35.972882, -83.942161)^[253][51].

   According to the [254]United States Census Bureau, the city has a total
   area of 98.1 square miles (254.0 km), of which, 92.7 square miles
   (240.0 km) of it is land and 5.4 square miles (14.1 km) of it is water.
   The total area is 5.5% water.^[255][1]

   In the southeast part of the city, the [256]French Broad River (flowing
   from [257]Asheville, [258]North Carolina) joins the [259]Holston River
   (flowing from [260]Kingsport) to form the [261]Tennessee River.
   Knoxville is centered around a hilly area along the north bank of the
   river between its First Creek and Second Creek tributaries. This area
   now comprises Downtown Knoxville. South Knoxville refers to the
   industrial and residential areas along the south bank of the river
   (extending to the Blount County line), and West Knoxville typically
   refers to the area beyond Sequoyah Hills, much of which is situated
   along [262]Kingston Pike and the merged I-40 and I-75. The Knox County
   section of the Tennessee River is technically part of Fort Loudoun
   Lake, an impoundment of the river created by the completion of
   [263]Fort Loudoun Dam (near [264]Lenoir City) in 1940.

   The hills and ridges surrounding Knoxville are part of the
   [265]Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley Province, which consists of a series
   of elongate and narrow ridges that traverse the upper Tennessee Valley.
   The most substantial Ridge-and-Valley structures in the Knoxville area
   are [266]Bays Mountain, which runs along the Knox-Blount county line to
   the south, and Beaver Ridge, which passes through the northern section
   of the town. The [267]Great Smoky Mountains a subrange of the
   [268]Appalachian Mountains are located approximately 20 miles (32 km)
   south of Knoxville.

   Principal highways serving the city [269]Interstate 40 to
   [270]Asheville, North Carolina, and [271]Nashville and [272]Interstate
   75 to [273]Chattanooga and [274]Lexington. Knoxville and the
   surrounding area is served by [275]McGhee Tyson Airport. Public
   transportation is provided by [276]KAT. Rail freight is offered by
   [277]CSX and [278]Norfolk Southern.

   climate classification Cfa), although it is not quite as hot as areas
   to the south and west due to the higher elevations. Summers are hot and
   very humid, with July highs averaging 88F (31C) and lows averaging 69F
   (20C). According to former local meteorologist Brittany Tarr, triple
   digit temperatures in Knoxville are fairly rare, however. Winters are

[[365]edit] Demographics

   Old Knox County Courthouse in Downtown Knoxville

   As of the [366]census^[367][4] of 2000, there were 177,661 people,
   76,650 households, and 40,164 families residing in the city, and the
   Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of 616,079.
   The [368]population density was 1,876.7 people per square mile
   (724.6/km). There were 84,981 housing units at an average density of
   917.1/sq mi (354.1/km). The racial makeup of the city was 79.7%
   [369]White, 16.2% [370]African American, 0.31% [371]Native American,
   1.45% [372]Asian, 0.03% [373]Pacific Islander, 0.72% from [374]other
   races, and 1.57% from two or more races. [375]Hispanic or [376]Latino
   of any race were 1.58% of the population.

   There were 76,650 households out of which 22.8% had children under the
   age of 18 living with them, 35.3% were married couples living together,
   13.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 47.6% were
   non-families. 38.3% of all households were made up of individuals and
   11.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The
   average household size was 2.12 and the average family size was 2.84.

   In the city the population was spread out with 19.7% under the age of
   18, 16.8% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and
   14.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years.
   For every 100 females there were 90.0 males. For every 100 females age
   18 and over, there were 86.3 males.

   The median income for a household in the city is $27,492, and the

   In 2006, [379]ERI published an analysis that identified Knoxville as
   the most affordable U.S. city for new college graduates, based on the
   ratio of typical salary to cost of living.^[380][53]

   Population and household growth are expected to follow employment
   growth, causing increased housing demand during the forecast period.
   Resident employment should continue to grow at a pace equal to that
   from 2000 to the Current date. As population continues to increase and
   the labor force grows, the unemployment rate is projected to increase
   slightly to 3.7 percent. The population growth is estimated to result
   in 12,900 new households in the HMA by the Forecast date. Demand for
   new housing for the period from April 1, 2005, to April 1, 2008, is
   estimated to total 13,100 units 10,400 sales units and 2,700 rental
   units.

[[381]edit] Households

   During the 1990s, growth in the number of households averaged 3,575 a
   year. The number of renter households grew by an average annual
   increase of 600 during the 1990s compared to an average annual increase
   of 900 from 2000 to the Current date. From 2000 to the Current date,
   the total average annual household growth was 3,925. Average annual
   household growth is expected to continue increasing by 4,300 through
   the forecast period and total 262,800 as of April 1, 2008. Since 1990,
   average household size in the HMA has been decreasing steadily. This
   decrease can be attributed to a growing number of students and retirees
   and to an overall demographic shift toward smaller families.

[[382]edit] Government

   Knoxville is governed by a mayor and nine-member City Council. It uses
   the strong-mayor form of the [383]mayor-council system.^[384][54] There
   are three council members who are elected at-large and six council
   members that represent individual districts. The City Council meets
   every other Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the Main Assembly Room of the
   [385]City County Building.^[386][55] As of 2008, the current [387]mayor
   is [388]Bill Haslam, who defeated Madeline Rogero in the 2003 election.
   The previous mayor of sixteen years, [389]Victor Ashe, was named
   [390]United States Ambassador to [391]Poland in June 2004. Ashe was
   term-limited and could not serve another term.

[[392]edit] Economy

   Knoxville's economy is largely fueled by the regional location of the
   main campus of the [393]University of Tennessee, the [394]Oak Ridge
   National Laboratory and other [395]Department of Energy facilities in
   nearby [396]Oak Ridge, the [397]National Transportation Research
   Center, and the [398]Tennessee Valley Authority. These make Knoxville
   the heart of the high-tech [399]Tennessee Valley Corridor, which
   extends from [400]Blacksburg, Virginia to [401]Huntsville,
   Alabama.^[[402]citation needed]

   Because of its central location in the eastern half of the United
   States and proximity to two major [403]Interstate highways, many
   [404]warehousing and [405]distribution companies operate in and around
   Knoxville.^[[406]citation needed] The [407]Old City is home to most of
   Knoxville's historic warehouses and factories.^[[408]citation needed]

   Knoxville also boasts an Opera Company which has been guided by Don
   Townsend for over two decades. The KOC performs a season of opera every
   year with a talented chorus as the backbone of each
   production.^[[450]citation needed]

   In its May 2003 "20 Most Rock & Roll towns in the U.S." feature,
   [451]Blender ranked Knoxville the 17th best music scene in the United

   heritage and showcases visual arts, folk arts, dance, games, music,
   storytelling, theater, and food. Autumn on the Square showcases
   national and local artists in outdoor concert series at historic Market
   Square, which has been revitalized with specialty shops and residences.

   where the Agees lived and chronicles the death of Agee's
   father.^[[463]citation needed] Another Pulitzer recipient, [464]Cormac
   McCarthy, spent most of his childhood in Knoxville. McCarthy graduated
