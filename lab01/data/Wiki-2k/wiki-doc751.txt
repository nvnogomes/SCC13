   The nonprofit Equity professional East Lynne Theater Company was
   founded in 1980 by [13]Warren Kliewer. At the time, there was no
   theater company in the United States dedicated to American Stage
   Classics. Mr. Kliewer saw the need to change this, by creating a
   company where theater-goers, actors, and directors, alike, could
   experience entertaining and provocative plays by American masters such
   as Washington Irving, Rachel Crothers, and Eugene ONeill. Many of the
   company's productions have not been produced for over fifty years, and
   in some cases, almost ninety. Still, the topics, characters, and
   situations, are relevant to today.

[[14]edit] Overview

   ELTC gives voice to the current generation of playwrights by producing
   World and NJ Premieres based on American literature and history, many
   of which have gone on to other stages and/or become part of the
   company's touring show offerings. ELTCs intern and artist-in-residence
   programs teach students acting, playwriting, and production.

   In 1996, Ohio State University asked to house the companys archives at
   its Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee Theatre Research Institute.
   Playbills, reviews, photographs and other memorabilia are sent to Ohio
   State every year.

   The company was founded in North Jersey, calling The William Carlos
   Williams Center in Rutherford its home, until The Mid-Atlantic Center
   for the Arts (MAC) asked ELTC to move its production season to Cape
   May, NJ. ELTC became known to MAC through its touring productions. In
   1989, ELTC produced it's first season in Cape May comprised of four
   different shows, running for four weeks in the fall.

   In 1998, after the death of Founding Artist Director Warren Kliewer,
   the Board of Trustees asked Gayle Stahlhuth to helm the company. Her
   background is in acting, directing, playwriting, and producing. The
   company has grown to 71 performances of seven different productions a
   season, running from mid-June through mid-December and March, in Cape
   May.

   The company is a member of The New Jersey Theater Alliance and The
   South Jersey Cultural Alliance, and has received grants from The New
   Jersey State Council on the Arts, The Cape May County Freeholders'
   Fund, New Jersey Council for the Humanities, and the New Jersey
   Historical Commission.

   The company employs members of Actors' Equity Association, mostly
   coming from New York City and North Jersey.

   During the Cape May performing season, the company is in residence at
   The First Presbyterian Church of Cape May. Touring and educational
   outreach is throughout the year, throughout the country. The title East
   Lynne is derived from a famous American play that was seen throughout
   the country during the last half of the 1800s.
