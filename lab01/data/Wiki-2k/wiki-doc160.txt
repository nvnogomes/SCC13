   "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" is a song written by [37]Bob Dylan
   in 1962, and released on the 1963 album [38]The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.

   Dylan once introduced "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" as "a
   statement that maybe you can say to make yourself feel better... as if
   you were talking to yourself." Written around the same time [39]Suze
   Rotolo indefinitely prolonged her stay in [40]Italy, "Don't Think
   Twice, It's All Right" is based on a melody taught to Dylan by
   folksinger [41]Paul Clayton. [42]NPR's Tim Riley described the song as
   "the last word in a long, embittered argument, a paper-thin consolation
   sung with spite."^[[43]citation needed]

   As well as the melody, a couple of lines were taken from Clayton's
   "Who's Goin' to Buy You Ribbons When I'm Gone?" which was recorded in
   1960, two years before Dylan wrote "Don't Think Twice." Lines taken
   word-for-word or slightly altered from the Clayton song are, "T'ain't
   no use to sit and wonder why, darlin'," and, "So I'm walkin' down that
   long, lonesome road." On the first release of the song, instead of "So
   I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road babe, where I'm bound, I
   can't tell" Dylan sings "So long, honey babe, where I'm bound, I can't
   tell". The lyrics were changed when Dylan performed live versions of
   the song and on cover versions recorded by other artists.

   The original album version of the song is played in a fast,
   [44]fingerstyle manner by [45]Bruce Langhorne.^[46][1] However, in live
   performances, Dylan often just strums the chords, or [47]flatpicks,
   albeit in a similar, fast-paced manner.

[[48]edit] Cover versions

   "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" has been covered by [49]Cher,

   Mary, [65]The Waifs, [66]Vonda Shepard, [67]John Martyn,[68]Metric,

   cover was the definitive single, reaching #9 pop, #2 easy listening on
   Billboard's charts.^[[88]citation needed]

   [89]The Four Seasons released a cover of the song as a single in
   [90]1965 (with the title "Don't Think Twice") under the pseudonym
   [91]The Wonder Who? Their "joke" version reached the #12 position on
   the [92]Billboard [93]Hot 100 chart and eventually sold one million
   copies.

   [94]The Seekers recorded a cover on their first album for EMI in 1965.

   [95]Eric Clapton performed a very distinct version of the song at the
   Bob Dylan [96]30th Anniversary Concert Celebration, and this version
   appears on the live double album of the same name. Clapton has also
   played the song at a few of his own live shows, sometimes in a duet
   with Dylan. A similar blues version was recorded by Clapton with
   [97]Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown and [98]Maria Muldaur.

   [99]Steel Train covered the song on [100]Listen to Bob Dylan: A
   Tribute.

   [101]Johnny Marr covered the song for an [102]Uncut compilation CD.

   The Brazilian musician Jefferson Gonalves covered the song on his album
   Conexo Nordeste, released in 2006.

   Australian folk band [103]The Waifs recorded a version of "Don't Think
   Twice..." on their live double-cd [104]A Brief History... and have
   included the song in live setlists regularly.

   Danish singer-songwriter [105]Tina Dico has covered the song in live
   performances, and a live version appears on the Special Edition of her
   2006 album [106]In The Red.

   [107]Randy Travis covered the song on his 2008 album [108]Around the
   Bend (album).
