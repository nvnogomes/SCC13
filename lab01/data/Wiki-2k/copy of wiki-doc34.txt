Agape

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Divine Love)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   This article is about the type of love. For the English adjective
   meaning "wide open," see the Wiktionary definition of [9]agape. For
   other uses of the word Agape, see [10]Agape (disambiguation).

   Agap (IPA: [11]/gpi/^[12][1]) ([13]Mod.Gk. [aa.pi]) ([14]Ke.
   IPA: [15][aga.p]), is one of several [16]Greek words translated into
   English as love. The word has been used in different ways by a variety
   of contemporary and ancient sources, including [17]Biblical authors.
   Many have thought that this word represents divine, unconditional,
   self-sacrificing, active, volitional, and thoughtful [18]love. Greek
   philosophers at the time of [19]Plato and other ancient authors have
   used forms of the word to denote love of a spouse or family, or
   affection for a particular activity, in contrast to [20]philiaan
   affection that could denote either brotherhood or generally non-sexual
   affection, and [21]eros, an affection of a sexual nature. The term
   'agape' is rarely used in ancient manuscripts, but was used by the
   early [22]Christians to refer to the self-sacrificing love of [23]God
   for humanity, which they were committed to reciprocating and practicing
   towards God and among one another (also see [24]kenosis).

   Agape has been expounded on by many Christian writers in a specifically
   Christian context. [25]Thomas Jay Oord has defined agape as "an
   intentional response to promote well-being when responding to that
   which has generated ill-being." Oord also argues that agape is not the
   only form of Christian love. Philia and eros can also be forms of love
   appropriate for Christians to express.

[[32]edit] Ancient usage

   A title of the goddess Isis was agape theon, or "beloved/darling of the
   gods," denoting her role as a fertility/life goddess and her pairing as
   a partner with the masculine god aspects. While this pairing was often
   sexual in nature, the term "agape" implied a genuine affection and deep
   love for the goddess.

   Although some sources claim Agape appears in the Odyssey twice, the
   word is in fact not used. Instead, two forms of the word agape may be
   found: agapton and agapazomenoi. Agapton is found in Book 5 of the
   Odyssey and means "beloved" or "well-loved". Agapazomenoi is found in
   books 7 and 17 of the Odyssey and means to treat with affection.

   The verb agapao is used extensively in the Septuagint as the
   translation of the common Hebrew term for love which is used to show
   affection for husband/wife and children, brotherly love, and God's love
   for humanity. It is uncertain why agapao was chosen, but similarity of
   consonant sounds (aava) may have played a part. It is not impossible
   that the Greek concept even originated as a transliteration from some
   Semitic tongue. This usage provides the context for the choice of this
   otherwise obscure word, in preference to other more common Greek words,
   as the most frequently used word for love in Christian writings. The
   use of the noun agape in this way appears to be an innovation of the
   New Testament writers, but is clearly derived from the use of the verb
   agapao in the Septuagint^[33][2].

   Agape is kin to Eros (intimate love) and Philia (fraternal or brotherly
   love)

          See also: [41]1 Corinthians 13

   Agape received a broader usage under later Christian writers as the
   word that specifically denoted "Christian" love or "[42]charity" ([43]1
   Corinthians 13:18), or even God ([44]1 John 4:8, , "God is Love"). The
   [45]New Testament provides a number of definitions and examples of
   agape that generally expand on the meanings derived from ancient texts,
   denoting brotherly love, love of one's spouse or children, and the love
   of God for all people^[46][3].

   The Christian usage of the term agape comes almost directly from the
   canonical [47]Gospels' account of the teachings of [48]Jesus. When
   asked what was the greatest [49]commandment, Jesus said, "'Love
   (agapao) the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
   and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment.
   And the second is like it: 'Love (agapao) your neighbor as yourself.'
   All the [50]Law and the [51]Prophets hang on these two commandments."
   ([52]Matthew 22:37-40)

   In [53]Judaism, the first ("...love the LORD your God...") is the
   [54]Shema, the second ("...love your neighbor...") is the [55]Great
   Commandment.

   At the [56]Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said:

   You have heard that it was said, 'Love (agapao) your neighbor and hate
   your enemy.' But I tell you: Love (agapao) your enemies and pray for
   those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven.
   He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on
   the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what
   reward will you get?

   Christian writers have generally described agape, as expounded on by
   Jesus, as a form of love which is both unconditional and voluntary.
   [57]Tertullian, in his 2nd century defense of Christians remarks how
   Christian love attracted pagan notice: "What marks us in the eyes of
   our enemies is our loving kindness. 'Only look,' they say, 'look how
   they love one another'" ([58]Apology 39).

   In the New Testament the noun agape is often used to describe God's
   love. However, the verb form agapao is at times used in a negative
   sense, where it retains its more general meaning of "affection" rather
   than divine love. Such examples include:
     * [59]2 Timothy 4:10"for Demas has forsaken me, having loved [agapao]
       this present world."
     * [60]John 12:43"for they loved [agapao] the praise of men more than
       the praise from God."
     * [61]John 3:19"but men loved [agapao] darkness instead of light
       because their deeds were evil."

[[62]edit] Agape as a meal

          Main article: [63]Agape feast

   The word agape in its plural form is used in the New Testament to
   describe a meal or feast eaten by early Christians, as in [64]Jude
   [65]1:12, and [66]2nd Peter [67]2:13. It is sometimes believed to be
   either related to the [68]Eucharist, or another term used for the
   Eucharist.
