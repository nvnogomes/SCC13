   Mos Eisley is a spaceport ^[22][1] town on the planet [23]Tatooine in
   the fictional [24]Star Wars universe. In [25]Star Wars Episode IV: A
   New Hope, [26]Obi-Wan Kenobi described Mos Eisley as a "wretched hive
   of scum and villainy." It is also the home of the [27]Mos Eisley
   Cantina and [28]Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes.

   From a distance, the spaceport looks like a haphazard collage of
   low-grade concrete, stone and plastoid structures that spread outward
   from a central power-and-water distribution plant like the spokes of a
   wheel. Also, at a distance, the smooth circular depressions of launch
   stations look like craters pockmarked the landscape.

   The town is really larger than it looks, as a good portion of it lies
   underground. In fact, the town has a population of around 40 to 60
   thousand people, varying seasonally. It had been built from the
   beginning with commerce in mind. Even the oldest of the town's
   buildings had been designed to provide protection from the twin suns.
   The buildings looked primitive from the outside and most of them
   actually were. The Mos Eisley Cantina used to be one of the spaceport's
   original blockhouses.

   Incidentally, the first view of Mos Eisley in [29]Star Wars Episode IV:
   A New Hope is actually a shot of [30]Death Valley in California, USA
   from near the "Dante's View" lookout, with a matte painting added in
   the distance. Also of note, one of the Stormtroopers here carried an
   [31]MG-34 machine gun, used by Germany in [32]World War II.

[[39]edit] Docking Bay 94

   Docking Bay 94 is a dock for parking ships in Mos Eisley for either
   maintenance or simply to take a break after a long day's work. It is
   also referred to as Dock 94.

   Until it housed the [40]Millennium Falcon in its hangar, Docking Bay 94
   was the same as the other hundreds of docks in Mos Eisley. It is simply
   a circular area surrounded by white walls and had an opening on the top
   for ships to enter and exit. There is a sole door to the dock, which
   was flanked by [41]sandtroopers from the [42]501st Legion in its most
   famous moment.

   In [43]Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, [44]Garindan, a spy who was
   working for the Empire, tracked [45]Han Solo and [46]Luke Skywalker to
   the hangar where Solo's ship was parked. The squad of Sandtroopers from
   the [47]501st were called in and entered the bay. Solo, who was making
   some last minute exterior adjustments on his ship, was suddenly
   interrupted by the shout of one of the troopers, "Stop that ship! Blast
   'em!" As the sandtroopers filed in and opened fire, Solo, who evaded
   their shots, managed to lay down suppression fire in return until he
   boarded the Millennium Falcon and took off.

[[48]edit] Mos Eisley Cantina

          Main article: [49]Mos Eisley Cantina

   The Mos Eisley Cantina, officially named Chalmun's Cantina, or the
   "double-c" or "ceecee" (by city militia), is a bar located in Mos
   Eisley. It is the haunt of freighter pilots and a host of other
   dangerous characters and contains booths, a bar counter, and some
   free-standing tables. At times, a band of musicians named [50]Figrin
   D'an and the Modal Nodes performs there.

   The Cantina was featured in the popular MMO Game, Star Wars Galaxies,
   which revealed the cantina as having 3 back rooms and one entrance room
   with seating area.

   It is also the start location for [51]Lego Star Wars II: The Original
   Trilogy, where players can access both standard and unlockable levels
   and items. Mos Eisley as a whole is featured in the game as the setting
   of Chapter 3 of Episode IV: A New Hope, "Mos Eisley Spaceport".

[[52]edit] References in popular culture

   Mos Eisley Grijpze is a [53]chiptune song by Dalezy named after the
   [54]Star Wars spaceport town.

   The indie pop band [55]Eisley is named after Mos Eisley. Before being
   signed the band was called Moss Eisley, but they dropped the first word
   for legal reasons.

   In the online game [56]Star Wars: Galaxies, the player can travel to
   Mos Eisley and access the spaceport, the shuttleports and talk to the
   mayor. In the game, Mos Eisley is run by Imperials.

   Mos Eisley's cantina is mentioned along with Tatooine in the
   [57]Blink-182 song "A New Hope."
