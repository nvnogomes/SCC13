          For the [32]Bobby Brown song, see [33]Don't Be Cruel (Bobby
          Brown song).

   "Don't Be Cruel" is a song by [34]Otis Blackwell, which was recorded by
   [35]Elvis Presley in 1956. It was inducted into the [36]Grammy Hall of
   Fame in 2002. In 2004, it was listed #197 in [37]Rolling Stone's list
   of [38]500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

   "Don't Be Cruel" was originally the [39]A side of RCA single 47-6604,
   with "[40]Hound Dog" on the [41]B-side,^[42][1] although both sides
   became chart-toppers, RCA reissuing the single in later decades as
   [43]double A-side. The single was the first to top all three extant
   [44]Billboard charts: pop, rhythm & blues, and country & western.

   The song was recorded for RCA Victor by Elvis' regular band of
   [45]Scotty Moore on lead guitar (with Elvis usually providing rhythm
   guitar), [46]Bill Black on bass, [47]D.J. Fontana on drums and backing
   vocals from the [48]Jordanaires. Presley recorded this song on [49]July
   2, [50]1956 at RCA's New York City studio. The producing credit was
   given to RCA's [51]Steve Sholes, however the studio recordings reveal
   that Elvis produced the songs in this session (as well as many others)
   himself, which is verified by the band members. Presley selected the
   song, reworked the arrangement himself on piano, and recorded eight
   takes of the song with the band (number 7 being the take released on
   the record) during one recording session following the thirty takes of
   "Hound Dog" (number 28 being released on the record) recorded that day.
   "Any Way You Want Me" was also recorded in that same session following
   "Don't Be Cruel". "Don't Be Cruel" and "Hound Dog" were released on
   [52]July 13, [53]1956.

   Presley reworked the Otis Blackwell demo and changed the music and
   lyrics, just as he did to other compositions by Blackwell. Hence the
   reason he received co-songwriting credit.

   Presley, Scotty, Bill, DJ, and the Jordanaires first performed "Don't
   Be Cruel" on national television on the [54]September 9, [55]1956
   [56]the Ed Sullivan Show. They revisited the song twice more when
   appearing on the Sullivan Show: [57]October 28 of the same year, and on
   [58]January 6, [59]1957.

   The song, listed as "Don't Be Cruel/Hound Dog" at the time of its
   release, hit #1 on the [60]Billboard Hot 100 the week ending [61]August
   18, [62]1956, and remained in the top position for 11 consecutive
   weeks, tying it with the 1950 [63]Anton Karas hit [64]The Third Man
   Theme and the 1951/1952 [65]Johnnie Ray hit [66]Cry for the longest
   stay at number one by a single record until 1992's smash "[67]End of
   the Road" by [68]Boyz II Men.
