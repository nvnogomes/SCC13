[[27]edit] Early career

   His parents were John James, a [28]solicitor and [29]secondary of the
   City of London, and his wife Caroline ne Combe, niece of [30]Harvey
   Christian Combe.^[31][1]

   He unsuccessfully attempted to establish a career as an actor at an
   early age, taking lessons from [32]John Cooper. He played at a private
   theatre in Gough Street, [33]Gray's Inn Road, London and appeared as
   George Barnwell in [34]The London Merchant at Cooper's [35]Theatre
   Royal, Bath.^[36][2] However, he lacked the natural good looks to
   succeed in the theatre, being said by [37]Cyrus Jay to have "the
   appearance of a [38]prize fighter"^[39][2] and he instead turned to the
   law to become a [40]barrister, being [41]called to the bar by the
   [42]Inner Temple in 1836.^[43][3]

   He practised on the Home circuit and his most famous cases included:
     * The successful [44]prosecution of [45]poisoner [46]William Palmer
       in 1856.^[47][3]
     * The successful defence of Dr [48]Simon Bernard, who was tried in
       1858 for [49]complicity with [50]Felice Orsini in his plot to
       [51]assassinate [52]Napoleon III of France.^[53][1] There was some
       scandal over his defence that Bernard had intended to kill a person
       other than Napoleon III.^[54][4] [55]John Simon was James's junior
       at the trial.^[56][5]
     * The [57]Canadian [58]appeal case of the runaway [59]slave [60]John
       Anderson.^[61][6]^[62][7]

   James was made [63]QC in 1850 but was not elected a [64]bencher of the
   Inner Temple as was customary, perhaps because of the establishment's
   distaste for his [65]radical sympathies and the nature of his
   practice.^[66][8] [67]The Spectator described him as:

     ... a leader in all actions for [68]seduction, [69]breach of promise
     of marriage, [70]assault, and [71]false imprisonment, and in all
     cases that involved the reputation of an actress or a horse.^[72][9]

   However, he was made [73]Recorder of [74]Brighton in 1855,^[75][1] by
   that time enjoying an income of 7,000 per year (477,000 at 2003
   prices^[76][10]).^[77][3] In 1859 he was elected [78]Liberal MP for
   [79]Marylebone.^[80][3]^[81][11]

[[82]edit] Scandal

   As an MP, he was a loyal supporter of [83]Palmerston and favoured the
   introduction of a [84]ballot for parliamentary elections and abolition
   of [85]church taxes.^[86][2] However, his radicalism went beyond the
   mainstream. He spoke in public in support of [87]democracy and against
   [88]Napoleon III, and spent part of 1859 at the camp of [89]Giuseppe
   Garibaldi. His reputation was further tainted by his alleged bribery of
   voters in his campaign on behalf of [90]John Jervis in the [91]Horsham
   in 1847.^[92][4]

   Nonetheless, early in 1861 James was reputedly on the point of being
   appointed [93]Attorney General^[94][12] but on 9 April 1861, he
   suddenly resigned all his public offices, stating that he needed to
   devote his time to his professional career.^[95][13]

   It came to light that he was in dire financial difficulties, owing
   100,000 (7.5 million at 2003 prices^[96][10]) and under investigation
   by his Inn. It was established that he had:^[97][3]
     * Led [98]Lord Worsley, the young son of [99]Lord Yarborough, into
       debts of 35,000 (2.6 million at 2003 prices^[100][10]) in 1857 and
       1860;
     * Obtained 20,000 (1.6 million at 2003 prices^[101][10]) from Mr
       Fryar, a solicitor and his election advisor, by
       [102]misrepresentation in 1853; and
     * Borrowed 1,250 (94,000 at 2003 prices^[103][10]) from a witness he
       was to [104]cross-examine in return for a promise of light
       questioning.

   It seems that it was Yarborough who had prevailed upon James to resign
   his public offices in order to protect Worsley. Nonetheless, on 9 July
   1861 James married Marianne ne Hilliard.^[105][2]

[[106]edit] Disbarment and after

   He was [107]disbarred on 18 June 1861 but emigrated to the [108]U.S.
   and was admitted to the bar in [109]New York. There he was lauded as a
   leader of the English Bar and he commented publicly on matters of
   public excitement such as the [110]Trent Affair. There was some
   cynicism about his American practice within the British press with
   accusations that the [111]New York Bar were well aware of his domestic
   disbarrment.^[112][14] However, when his earlier conduct did become
   known in America, an attempt was made to disbar him there, only failing
   when he denied the charges on [113]oath and the judges were equally
   divided as to his culpability.^[114][6] He also appears to have
   resurrected, either through inclination or necessity, his acting
   career, appearing at the [115]Winter Garden Theatre, [116]New York in
   1865. He had married in 1861 but his wife divorced him in 1863. He took
   [117]American citizenship in 1866 and married Eliza ne Wilson
   (18251902) in 1868.^[118][2]

   He returned to England in 1873 but failed to be readmitted to the bar
   of [119]England and Wales. Though he tried, he also failed to be
   admitted as a solicitor or to be selected for Marylebone. He practised
   as a [120]paralegal for the rest of his life but was in poor financial
   circumstances, ultimately coming to rely on [121]charity.^[122][3]
