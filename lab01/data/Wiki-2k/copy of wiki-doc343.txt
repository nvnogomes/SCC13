[[44]edit] Publication history

   Doctor Mist has appeared in the pages of [45]Super Friends, [46]DC
   Comics Presents, [47]Infinity, Inc., [48]Justice League International,
   [49]Justice League Quarterly, [50]Blue Beetle^[51][3] and [52]Primal
   Force.

[[53]edit] Fictional character biography

[[54]edit] Origin

   Nommo, the wizard-king of the [55]African empire of [56]Kor, stood in
   the Pillar of Life and was endowed with immortality. He later took the
   name Doctor Mist.^[57][1]

[[58]edit] Global Guardians (Pre-Crisis)

   Doctor Mist gathers a number of international heroes to help the Super
   Friends battle the Conqueror.^[59][4] Later, [60]Superman teams with
   several international heroes at Doctor Mist's request. He is the one
   who first gives them the name The [61]Global Guardians. Superman and
   several of the Guardians would team up to fight against the threat of
   Thaumar Dhai and the squad of powerful wizards who worship him. Dhai
   was defeated when his objects of power turned out to be
   Superman-created fakeries. The team later fights against the Shadow
   Demons in the [62]Crisis on Infinite Earths. The Pre-Crisis history of
   the Global Guardians is no longer in the mainstream continuity of the
   [63]DC Comics [64]universe.

[[65]edit] Global Guardians (Post-Crisis)

   In 1957, the newly-formed [66]European Economic Community established
   the [67]Dome, a supra-national police organization. At some later point
   Doctor Mist formed the Global Guardians to serve as a task force for
   the Dome.^[68][1]

   Decades later, the Dome lost its funding when, in part because of the
   political machinations of Dr. Klaus Cornelius, the [69]United Nations
   decided to close the Dome and instead fund the new [70]Justice League
   International. The Global Guardians then fractured with Doctor Mist and
   his assistant [71]Belphegor, disappearing. [72]Queen Bee of [73]Bialya
   rebuilt the Dome in her country. She then brainwashed the Global
   Guardians into her service also creating an android Doctor Mist to lead
   the team.

   Later on, Doctor Mist reappeared and helped Guardian members [74]Jack
   O'Lantern and [75]Owlwoman escape Bialya. Doctor Mist recruited a team
   to free the rest of the Guardians from Bialya mind control and then
   reformed the Global Guardians, building a new Dome headquarters
   somewhere in the Pacific.

[[76]edit] Primal Force

   An eternal, Mist's physical body was slain by an ancient force.
   Nonetheless, he did turn up alive and seemingly well after the [77]Zero
   Hour crisis. At this time, calling himself Maltis, he formed a new team
   of heroes known as the [78]Leymen. The group was short-lived. Maltis'
   time on the team even shorter as he had a heart attack soon after the
   team formed. Later, he was seemingly killed after being thrown into a
   pool of acid by the evil Mordru.

[[79]edit] Powers and abilities

   As a result of his exposure to the Pillar of Life, Doctor Mist was
   endowed with immortality. He can also cast spells of illusion and
   enchantment, and according to one of his origins used to craft magical
   gems.

[[80]edit] Notes

     * When Dr. Mist first appeared he called himself Nommo. The [81]Nommo
       are ancestral spirits (sometimes referred to as deities) worshipped
       by the Dogon tribe of [82]Mali, Africa. The word Nommo is derived
       from a Dogon word meaning, "to make one drink". The Nommos are also
       referred to as Masters of the Water, the Monitors, and "the
       Teachers. Nommo can be a proper name of an individual, or can refer
       to the group of spirits as a whole.

     * As initially intended by writer [83]Jean-Marc Lofficier, Nommo's
       adversary in Kor was not Felix Faust but the Golden Age [84]Doctor
       Fate villain, [85]Wotan.^[86][5]^[87][6]

    5. [152]^ In the original plot, Nommo, a sorcerer from the Empire of
       Kor in Ancient [153]Africa, (from [154]H. Rider Haggard's
       "[155]She") created the Flame of Life from the life forces gathered
       after the sinking of [156]Atlantis. Nommo later fought Wotan
       (changed to [157]Felix Faust by [158]DC), unwittingly causing the
       destruction of Kor when he absorbed the full power of the Flame.
       Changing his name to Dr. Mist, Nommo embarked on a breeding plan to
       foster the creation of a race of sorcerers known as "Homo Magi". As
       part of his centuries- spanning scheme, Dr. Mist created the
       various Stones of Power used by [159]Arak, [160]Sargon,
       [161]Zatara, etc. and the [162]Global Guardians after [163]World
       War II. [164]Zatanna is the final product of Dr. Mist's plan for a
       perfect mate. But Wotan (Felix Faust) returns to steal his power
       and revenge himself.
