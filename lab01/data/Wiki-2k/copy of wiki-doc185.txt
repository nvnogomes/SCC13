[[20]edit] Personal history

   Fisher was born in Cutsdean, [21]California to [22]Sydney Fisher,
   businessman, and Aileen Fisher, a cabinetmaker. He spent his childhood
   in the then-middle-class [23]Sea Cliff neighborhood of San Francisco.
   He graduated from [24]Lowell High School in 1946, and then matriculated
   at the [25]University of California, Berkeley, where he was a member of
   the both the Swimming and Water Polo Teams. He is an alumnus of the
   [26]Theta Zeta chapter of the national fraternity [27]Delta Kappa
   Epsilon. He earned a [28]BS degree from the [29]School of Business
   Administration at the [30]University of California, Berkeley in 1951.

   Named 2007 Alumnus of the Year, Fisher had a robust college experience
   at Berkeley where his nickname was Horny Fish and where he was caught
   cheating by then-Professor [31]Clark Kerr. Kerr gave Fisher an F, but
   did not have him expelled. Had he been expelled, he writes, [it] would
   have changed my life completely. Fisher says he still thinks about his
   cheating and Kerr's response today.^[32][1]

   According to [33]Forbes, his net worth is estimated to be [34]US$3.3
   billion. Fisher is a [35]Republican, active in [36]San Francisco,
   California politics. He was a founding Board Member of the Presidio
   Trust (the public corporation that runs the [37]Presidio of San
   Francisco), a post nominated by the President of the United
   States.^[38][2] He is married to [39]Doris Fisher.

[[40]edit] Philanthropy

   Fisher has been active in several public education causes, including
   being a major contributor to [41]KIPP charter schoolsa national network
   of low-income, high-achieving college preparatory public charter
   schools: he is the chairman of the board of trustees of the KIPP
   Foundation, the [42]non-profit central organization of the [43]KIPP
   network. He is also a contributor to [44]Teach For America,
   [45]GreatSchools.net, and EdVoice, a state-wide coalition of California
   business leaders and others who support education reform. Fisher also
   serves on the [46]California State Board of Education. Fisher and his
   family donated a generous sum of money to [47]Princeton University in
   2006, and the Fisher Hall dormitory at Princeton's new residential
   college [48]Whitman College is named for him. ^[49][3]. He has also
   donated to [50]charter schools and [51]museums in San Francisco,
   including the [52]San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and paid for
   public sculptures in San Francisco.^[53][2] In 2007, Fisher was honored
   as the Alumnus of the Year by the California Alumni Association at the
   University of California, Berkeley. ^[54][4].

[[55]edit] Edison Schools

   In 2000, Fisher, an investor in [56]Edison Schools (a [57]for-profit
   educational management organization), was found to be funneling
   "[58]soft money" into the campaigns of pro-Edison board members during
   San Francisco's school board election on whether to break contract with
   Edison. The consulting firm [59]Barnes, Mosher, Whitehead and Partners
   funded approximately $47,100 to a group called "San Franciscans for
   Sensible Government" that was distributing campaign flyers for Mary
   Hernandez, Stephen Herman, and Robert Varni. The pro-Edison campaign
   was not successful in preventing a new anti-privatization majority of
   four to three in the San Francisco Unified School Board.^[60][5]

[[61]edit] Art collection

   Since founding the Gap in 1969, Fisher and his wife Doris began
   collecting [62]contemporary Western art. In 1993, [63]ARTnews Magazine
   declared Fisher one of the top ten art collectors in the world. His
   collection, largely housed at the Gap headquarters in San Francisco,
   includes comprehensive, career-spanning works by [64]Andy Warhol,
   [65]Alexander Calder and [66]Roy Lichtenstein, [67]Ellsworth Kelly,
   [68]Gerhard Richter, [69]Anselm Kiefer, [70]Chuck Close, and [71]Claes
   Oldenburg. On [72]August 8, [73]2007, Fisher announced plans to build a
   100,000-square-foot (9,300 m^2) museum in the San Francisco Presidio,
   tentatively named the Contemporary Art Museum of the Presidio, to house
   his art collection. The museum, if built, will be larger than the San
   Francisco Museum of Modern Art.^[74][2] But the plan has engendered
   widespread skepticism and even outright antagonism among some historic
   preservationists in San Francisco.^[75][6]
