List of Hobbits

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   In [9]J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, [10]Hobbits are a fictional race
   related to [11]Men. They first appear in [12]The Hobbit and play an
   important role in the [13]The Lord of the Rings story.

   This is a list of hobbits that are mentioned by name in Tolkien's
   works. They are ordered alphabetically by first name. In cases where a
   hobbits family name was changed, usually through marriage, their
   original family name is given in parentheses. Nicknames are given in
   quotation marks.

   Note that the years are given in years of the [14]Third Age (unless
   otherwise noted), and not according to [15]Shire Reckoning.

   One line from The Hobbit includes Bilbo's assumption that Gandalf is
   "responsible for so many hobbit lads and lasses" (emphasis added) going
   on adventures.

   unnamed daughters. Her years of birth and death are not given in The
   Lord of the Rings, but a birth-year of 2818 for her appears on
   [46]Bolger family tree 'BG4' in [47]The Peoples of Middle-earth.
   Adamanta (Chubb) Took: Wife of [48]Gerontius Took and mother of
   [49]Isengrim III Took, [50]Hildigard Took, [51]Isumbras IV Took,

   (and Bilbo's mother's side) and Bilbo's second cousin on his mother's
   side (and Bilbo's father's side), making him an excellent example of
   the complicated kinship relationships among Hobbits.
   Adelard Took: (2928[65]F.A. 2) Son of [66]Flambard Took and father of
   [67]Reginard Took, [68]Everard Took, and three unnamed daughters. Bilbo

   rope-making.
   Angelica (Baggins): (2981?) Daughter of [73]Ponto Baggins. Noted for
   her vanity. Received a mirror from Bilbo after the farewell party.
   Asphodel (Brandybuck) Burrows: (29133012) The fifth child of

[[78]edit] B

   Balbo Baggins: (2767c. 2863) is the first recorded Baggins, and the
   ancestor of the Baggins family of Hobbiton. He married Berylla Boffin
   and had five children: [79]Mungo, [80]Pansy, [81]Ponto, [82]Largo, and
   [83]Lily.
     * Note on Balbo's dates: In the published Baggins genealogy only
       Balbo's birthdate is shown, but by looking at his children it is
       possible to estimate his deathdate.

   Bandobras "Bullroarer" Took: (27042806) led the defence against the
   [84]orcs of Mt. Gram led by [85]Golfimbul at the Battle of Greenfields.
   He was known for his exceptionally large stature for a Hobbit (he could
   ride a horse), although he was later surpassed by his descendant Pippin
   and Pippin's friend Merry Brandybuck. He was the son of Thain
   [86]Isengrim II. He was the younger of two sons, and his older brother
   Ferumbras succeeded to the Thainship. He was also known for knocking
   the head off of the leader of the orcs at the Battle of Greenfields,
   and having it land in a rabbit hole, inventing the sport of golf.
   Belba (Baggins) Bolger: (28562956) The wife of [87]Rudigar Bolger and
   second child of [88]Mungo Baggins and [89]Laura Baggins.

   Gamgee, [95]Samwise Gamgee, and [96]Marigold Cotton.
   Belladonna (Took) Baggins: (28522934) The "remarkable" ninth child, and
   eldest daughter, of [97]Gerontius Took and [98]Adamanta Took. Wife of
   [99]Bungo Baggins and mother of [100]Bilbo Baggins. She was also well
   known to the wizard [101]Gandalf.

   of [103]Mungo Baggins, [104]Pansy Bolger, [105]Ponto Baggins,
   [106]Largo Baggins, and [107]Lily Goodbody. Her years of birth and
   death are not given in The Lord of the Rings, but a birth-year of 2772

   She had one son Faramir, named for a [134]Steward of Gondor (see
   [135]Faramir). Her date of death is not known, but some people assume

   Crickhollow at the start of [152]The Fellowship of the Ring. She
   married Master [153]Meriadoc Brandybuck of Buckland, and had at least
   one son. Estella probably died sometime before the year 63 of the
   Fourth Age when Merry left the [154]Shire to live in [155]Gondor. She
   was added to the family tree by Tolkien for the Ballantine edition, and
   remained an anomaly until the consolidation of the text in the Houghton

   history. The twenty sixth Thain of the Shire, he ruled for 72 years,
   and died at the age of 130. He was particular friends with Gandalf, and
   was a direct ancestor to the majority of the famous Hobbits in The Lord
   of the Rings. He married Adamanta Chubb and had twelve children; nine
   sons: Isengrim III, Hildigard, Isumbras IV, Hildigrim
   (great-grandfather to [176]Peregrin Took & [177]Meriadoc Brandybuck),

   Hamfast "Ham / Gaffer / Old" Gamgee: The father of [188]Samwise Gamgee.
   He married [189]Bell Goodchild, with whom he had six children,
   including Samwise, and lived at number three Bagshot Row in the
   [190]Shire. He was a [191]gardener on the [192]Baggins property at
   [193]Bag End for many years. He was frequently consulted for his
   knowledge of root vegetables, generally over a pint at [194]The Green
   Dragon, an inn at Bywater. Early in [195]The Fellowship of the Ring, he
   unintentionally tells a [196]Nazgl that [197]Frodo had left Bag End,
   putting Frodo in danger. He also plays a minor role in [198]The Return
   of the King. Samwise, after adopting the name Gardner, named one of his

   played his part in helping free the Shire.

[[206]edit] K

[[207]edit] L

   Lalia (Clayhanger) Took: (28833002) was the wife of Thain Fortinbras
   Took II. She married in 2914, and her son [208]Ferumbras was born two
   years later. Ferumbras never married, reportedly because nobody wanted
   Lalia as a mother-in-law. Lalia was so fat she couldn't walk and was
   confined to a wheelchair: she was widely known as Lalia the Great (or
   sometimes the Fat). In 3002 her attendant, [209]Pearl Took,
   accidentally tipped Lalia out of her wheelchair into her garden, and
   she died. (Lalia isn't on the Took family tree published in [210]The
   Lord of the Rings, but she is mentioned in [211]The Letters of J.R.R.
   Tolkien.)
   Largo Baggins:
   Laura (Grubb) Baggins: (28142916) was the grandmother of Bilbo Baggins.
   She was the wife of Mungo Baggins. Besides Bungo, she had four other
   children; [212]Belba, Longo, Linda, and [213]Bingo. Upon the death of
   her husband she became head of the family. When she died she was
   succeeded by her eldest son, [214]Bungo.
   Lily (Baggins) Goodbody:
   Lily (Brown) Cotton:
   Linda (Baggins) Proudfoot: (28622963) was the sister of [215]Bungo
   Baggins. She married [216]Bodo Proudfoot, and had a son named [217]Odo.
   Linda was also an aunt of Bilbo Baggins.
   Lobelia (Bracegirdle) Sackville-Baggins: (c. 29183020) married
   [218]Otho, and had a son, Lotho. Portrayed as unpleasant and grasping,
   Lobelia's principal ambition was to acquire the manor smial of [219]Bag
   End for her family. A first attempt was made during [220]Bilbo's
   journey to [221]Erebor, as Lobelia's husband, Otho, was Bilbo's first
   cousin and [222]heir at law, and Bilbo was widely believed to be dead.
   This attempt was foiled when Bilbo returned during an auction of Bag
   End's contents. However, much of Bilbo's silverware vanished during his
   absence; when Bilbo left the Shire permanently, he gave Lobelia a box
   of silver spoons labeled "For Lobelia, from Cousin Bilbo, as a
   present." Years later, after Otho's death, Lobelia finally obtained
   title to Bag End when Frodo sold it to her below [223]fair market
   value, as he was in a rush to leave the Shire with the [224]One Ring. A
   shift in Lobelia's character occurs when Frodo is away on his quest.
   Lobelia opposed Saruman's ruffians, verbally and physically, and was
   imprisoned in the Lockholes of [225]Michel Delving for her actions.
   This feat earned her popularity among the Shire-folk for the first time
   in her life. Freed after the [226]Scouring of the Shire but greatly
   weakened, Lobelia deeded Bag End back to Frodo, ending the
   generation-long feud between Bilbo and Frodo and the
   Sackville-Bagginses. Devastated by her son Lotho's murder, Lobelia
   moved back with her original family, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle.
   She died in 3020, and was over 100 years old. She bequeathed what
   remained of her money to helping hobbits made homeless during Saruman's
   regime.
   Longo Baggins: (28602950)
   Lotho "Pimple" Sackville-Baggins: He was called "Pimple" because of his
   complexion. He became an accomplice of [227]Saruman during the [228]War
   of the Ring. Trading [229]pipeweed with Saruman for money, he began
   buying land in the Southfarthing, where [230]Men from [231]Isengard
   were stationed. With the aid of these [232]Ruffians, Lotho was able to
   depose and imprison [233]Will Whitfoot, the Shire's lawful mayor, and
   declared himself Chief Shirriff. Under his command the Shire was
   industrialised. Lotho began to call himself The Boss. However, Lotho
   was soon stripped of his power, and Saruman took over. Saruman's
   servant [234]Grma Wormtongue killed Lotho, and either buried Lothoor
   ate him, as hinted by Saruman's vicious remarks after his defeat in the
   Shire.

[[235]edit] M

   Madoc "Proudneck" Brandybuck: (27752877)
   Malva "Headstrong" Brandybuck: (c. 27382839) was the first female

   [239]Bilbo Baggins. She danced the Springle-ring (a hobbit dance) with
   [240]Everard Took. She was a third cousin of [241]Meriadoc Brandybuck.
   Menegilda (Goold) Brandybuck:

   was the eldest son of [243]Balbo Baggins and [244]Berylla Boffin
   Baggins. Mungo had four younger siblings: Pansy, Ponto, Largo, and
   Lily. Mungo married [245]Laura Grubb and had five children.
   Myrtle (Burrows):

[[246]edit] N

   Nob: Hobbit of Bree and servant at the [247]Prancing Pony.

[[248]edit] O

   Odo Proudfoot: (29043005) was a son of [249]Bodo Proudfoot and
   [250]Linda Baggins and cousin of [251]Bilbo Baggins. Had a son named
   Olo. Odo makes a brief appearance in the first chapter of [252]The
   Fellowship of the Ring, angrily correcting Bilbo when the latter
   referred to the Proudfeet as "Proudfoots" in his speech at the Farewell
   Party. In the [253]New Line Cinema movie adaptation the character is
   called Everard Proudfoot and is portrayed by [254]Noel Appleby.
   Odovacar Bolger: was the husband of [255]Rosamunda Took and father of
   [256]Fredegar Bolger.
   Olo Proudfoot: (2946[257]F.A. 15) was a son of Odo Proudfoot and the
   father of [258]Sancho Proudfoot.
   Orgulas Brandybuck: (2468?) was a son of [259]Marmadoc Brandybuck and
   the father of [260]Gorbulas Brandybuck.
   Otho Sackville-Baggins: (29103012) though his father was a Baggins, he
   inherited headship of the Sackville family through his mother,
   Camellia. Thus, Otho effectively founded a new family:
   Sackville-Baggins. He was [261]Bilbo Baggins' [262]first cousin and
   closest living heir, and therefore, his ambition was to succeed Bilbo
   as head of the Baggins family and be head of two families at once. With
   his formidable wife, Lobelia, he attempted to seize [263]Bag End for
   his own during Bilbo's extended absence while accompanying
   [264]Thorin's dwarves to [265]Erebor. However, this was foiled when
   Bilbo reappeared during an auction of Bag End's contents by the firm of
   Grubb, Grubb & Burrowes. Otho was later infuriated by Bilbo adopting
   [266]Frodo Baggins, a more distant relative, as his heir, and
   scrutinized Bilbo's will for any irregularities under Shire ink laws.
   Otho died between the time of Bilbo's Long Expected Party and Frodo's
   departure to [267]Bree. Accordingly, he never enjoyed the luxuries of
   Bag End when Lobelia finally took ownership.

[[268]edit] P

   Paladin II Took: Father of [269]Pippin Took. When [270]Lotho
   Sackville-Baggins took over the Shire, Paladin, as [271]Thain, resisted
   him, and refused to acknowledge his rule. This led to skirmishing
   between the Tooks and the ruffians. Ultimately, Paladin sends his son

   Pansy (Baggins) Bolger:
   Pearl (Took): (2975?) was the eldest sister of [272]Peregrin "Pippin"
   Took. She also had two sisters named Pimpernel and Pervinca. Pearl
   probably died sometime before the year 63 of the [273]Fourth Age when
   Pippin left the Shire to live in Gondor. In [274]The Letters of J.R.R.
   Tolkien it is mentioned that she was the caretaker of the Took
   matriarch Lalia (Clayhanger)Took, the acid-tongued mother of Thain
   [275]Ferumbras Took. Lalia was obese and immobile, and perished when
   her wheelchair tipped from the top of Great Smials and she tumbled into
   the gardens. It was widely speculated that Pearl might have been
   intentionally responsible for Lalia's "fatal fall" by tipping the
   chair, a feat for which she was lauded by the other Tooks.

   the youngest daughter of the Old Took. She married [279]Drogo Baggins,
   and had one child, [280]Frodo. In 2980, both she and Drogo drowned in
   the [281]Baranduin, leaving Frodo orphaned.

   Rorimac "Goldfather / Old Rory" Brandybuck:
   Rosa (Baggins) Took: (2856?) was an ancestor of both [284]Merry and
   [285]Pippin. Rosa was the daughter of [286]Ponto Baggins and
   [287]Mimosa Bunce. She had a younger brother, Polo. Her husband was
   [288]Hildigrim Took, one of the many sons of the Old Took.
   Rosamunda (Took) Bolger: Mother of [289]Fredegar Bolger and
   [290]Estella Bolger, she married [291]Odovacar Bolger of Budge Ford. A
   descendant of the [292]Old Took, Rosamunda was the [293]second cousin
   of the Thain, [294]Paladin Took and his sister [295]Esmeralda
   Brandybuck (ne Took).
   Rose "Rosie" (Cotton) Gardner: (2984[296]F.A. 61). Daughter of
   [297]Tolman Cotton and [298]Lily Brown and sister of Tolman (Tom),
   Wilcome (Jolly), Bowman (Nick), and Carl (Nibs). Rosie was a long-time
   friend of [299]Samwise Gamgee, and they were married in 3020 when Sam
   returned home after the [300]War of the Ring. Sam and Rosie had
   thirteen children (Elanor, Frodo, Rose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks,
   Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby, Robin, Tolman (Tom)). Many were
   named after Sam and Rosie's friends and relatives. Among them were
   Elanor the Fair, Frodo Gardner, and Goldilocks. Rosie died in the year
   61 of the Fourth Age. Sam then left Middle-earth for the [301]Undying
   Lands later that year. 'Cotton' in Hobbitish is 'Hlothran'. In the film
   trilogy Rosie lives at 10 Bagshot Row and is played by [302]Sarah
   McLeod.

     "I think the simple 'rustic' love of Sam and his Rosie (nowhere
     elaborated) is absolutely essential to the study of his (the chief
     hero's) character, and to the theme of the relation of ordinary life
     (breathing, eating, working, begetting) and quests, sacrifice,
     causes, and the 'longing for Elves', and sheer beauty." - [303]J. R.
     R. Tolkien letter dated 1951

   Thain of the Shire. His nickname, 'Scattergold', implies that he was
   very generous with his wealth.

   Tanta (Hornblower) Baggins:
   Ted Sandyman: Ted Sandyman is a miller in Hobbiton. When first Lotho
   and then [313]Saruman take control of the Shire, he is persuaded to
   make "improvements" to it, which many hobbits considered to be ugly,
   and which may have done little to increase its power. He supports many
   of the changes made by Saruman.
   Tobold "Old Toby" Hornblower: Tobold Hornblower is the first person to
   domesticate in Middle-earth pipe-weed, which he does in 2670. This
   development leads to its cultivation in the [314]Southfarthing, and the
   pipe-weed, known as Longbottom Leaf from the city where Hornblower was
   from, becomes an important product of the Shire and is widely regarded
   as the finest pipe-weed. This was shown by the fact that Saruman
   imports barrels of it to [315]Isengard.

   Will "old Will / old Flourdumpling" Whitfoot: At the time of the
   [320]War of the Ring, Will Whitfoot is Mayor of [321]Michel Delving. He
   was said to be the fattest [322]hobbit in the Westfarthing. On one
   occasion the roof of the Town Hole collapsed, covering Will in chalk
   and earning him the nickname 'Flourdumpling'. Soon after [323]Frodo
   Baggins left [324]Bag End, Lotho Sackville-Baggins began buying
   properties in the Southfarthing. With the aid of ruffians in the pay of
   [325]Saruman, Lotho quickly took control of the Shire. When Will went
   to Bag End to protest, he was seized by the ruffians and locked up. He
   spent nearly a year in imprisonment, until he was released after the
   [326]Scouring of the Shire. He spent several months recovering, during
   which time Frodo Baggins acted as Deputy Mayor. At the Free Fair of
   S.R. 1420, Will Whitfoot is re-elected as Mayor for another seven
   years. His successor in the post is [327]Sam Gamgee.
