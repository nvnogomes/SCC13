Easy to borrow

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   In [8]securities lending, securities are classified by their
   availability to be borrowed. Highly [9]liquid securities are considered
   "easy"; these products are easily found on the market should someone
   decide to borrow them for the purpose of [10]selling them short.
   Securities that are illiquid in the market are classified as "hard".
   Due to various regulations, a short sale transaction in the United
   States and some other countries must be preceded by [11]locating the
   security and quantity that one would like to be able to sell short in
   order to avoid [12]naked shorting. However, the lending broker can
   create a list of securities that do not require such a locate. This
   list is referred to as an easy-to-borrow (abbreviated as ETB) list, and
   is also known as blanket assurances. Such a list is generated by
   broker-dealers based on "reasonable assurance"^[13][1] that the
   securities on the list are readily available upon customer request.
   However, if a security on the list cannot be delivered as promised (a
   "failure to deliver" would occur), the assumption of reasonable grounds
   no longer applies. In order to provide better grounding for such
   assumptions, the ETB list must be at most 24 hours old.
