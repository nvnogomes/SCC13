   Wittenberg, officially Lutherstadt Wittenberg, is a [51]town in
   [52]Germany in the [53]Bundesland [54]Saxony-Anhalt, on the [55]Elbe
   River. It has a population of about 50,000.

   The importance of Wittenberg historically was due to its seat of the
   [56]Elector of Saxony, a dignity held by the dukes of
   [57]Saxe-Wittenberg and also to its close connection with [58]Martin
   Luther and the dawn of the [59]Protestant Reformation; several of its
   buildings are associated with the events of this time. Part of the
   [60]Augustinian [61]monastery in which Luther dwelt, first as a monk
   and later as owner with his wife and family, is preserved and
   considered to be the world's premier museum dedicated to Luther.

[[69]edit] History

   A settlement was mentioned first in 1180 as a small village founded by
   [70]Flemish colonists under the rule of the [71]House of Ascania. In
   1260 it became the residence of the dukes of [72]Saxe-Wittenberg, and
   in 1293 the settlement was granted a [73]town charter. Wittenberg
   developed into an important trade centre during the following
   centuries, due to its location. When the Ascanians died out,
   Saxe-Wittenberg passed to the [74]House of Wettin. The city became an
   important regional political and cultural centre at the end of the 15th
   century, when [75]Frederick III "the Wise", Elector of Saxony, took up
   residence in Wittenberg. Several parts of the city were extended soon
   afterward: the second bridge over the Elbe was built from 1486 to 1490
   and the castle church, the Schlosskirche, was built from 1496 to 1506.
   The palace was rebuilt the same time.

   In 1502 the [76]University of Wittenberg was founded and gave a home to
   many important thinkers, among them [77]Martin Luther (Professor of
   Theology from 1508) and [78]Philipp Melanchthon (Professor of Greek
   from 1518).

   On [79]October 31 1517, Luther nailed his [80]95 theses against the
   selling of [81]indulgences at the door of the [82]All Saints', the
   Castle Church, marking the beginning of the [83]Protestant Reformation.
   The [84]Anabaptist movement also had one of its earliest homes in
   Wittenberg, when the [85]Zwickau prophets moved there in late 1521,
   only to be suppressed by Luther when he returned from the [86]Wartburg
   in spring 1522. The [87]Capitulation of Wittenberg (1547) is the name
   given to the treaty by which [88]John Frederick the Magnanimous was
   compelled to resign the electoral dignity and most of his territory to
   the Albertine branch of the [89]House of Wettin.

   In 1760 during the [90]Seven Years' War, the [91]Prussian-occupied town
   was bombarded by the [92]Austrians. It was occupied by the [93]French
   in 1806, and refortified in 1813 by command of [94]Napoleon. In 1814 it
   was stormed by the [95]Prussian Army under [96]Tauentzien, who received
   the title of "von Wittenberg" as a reward. In 1815 Wittenberg became
   part of Prussia and was administered within the [97]Province of Saxony.
   Wittenberg continued to be a fortress of the third class until the
   reorganization of German defenses after the foundation of the new
   [98]German Empire led to its being dismantled in 1873.

   Unlike many other historic German cities during [99]World War II,
   Wittenberg was spared destruction during the war. The [100]Allies
   agreed not to bomb Wittenberg, though there was fighting in the city,
   with bullet pock-marks visible on the statues of Luther and Melanchthon
   at the market square, or so the popular version of the city's history
   goes. In actuality, the Luther statue was not even present in the city
   square during much of the war. It was stored at Luther Brunnen, a
   roadhouse only a few kilometers north of the city.

   Wittenberg's reputation as a city protected from Allied bombing is also
   not historically accurate. There was on the outskirts of Wittenberg the
   [101]Arado Flugzeugwerke (Arado Aircraft Factory), which produced
   aircraft components for Hitler's airforce. The factory was staffed by
   Jews, Russians, Poles, political prisoners, and even a few
   Americans--all prisoners engaging in forced labor. Despite the prisoner
   status of its workers, American and British planes bombed the factory
   near the end of WWII. One thousand prisoner workers were killed. The
   recent publication of "...und morgen war Krieg!" by Renate
   Gruber-Lieblich attempts to document this tragic bombing of Wittenberg.

   At the end of the war, Wittenberg was occupied by [102]Soviet forces,
   and became part of the [103]German Democratic Republic in 1949. By
   means of the [104]peaceful revolution in 1989, the communist regime was
   brought down and the city has been governed democratically since 1990.

[[105]edit] Main sights

   Wittenberg is home to numerous important historical artifacts, as well
   as portraits and other paintings by the [106]Cranachs. On the doors of
   [107]All Saints' Church, the Schlosskirche ("castle church" built
   14961506) Luther nailed his [108]95 theses in 1517. It was seriously
   damaged by fire in 1760 during a bombardment by the French during the
   [109]Seven Years' War, was practically rebuilt, and was later
   (18851892) restored. The wooden doors, burnt in 1760, were replaced in
   1858 by bronze doors, bearing the Latin text of the theses. Inside the
   church are the tombs of Luther and [110]Philipp Melanchthon, and of the
   electors [111]Frederick the Wise (by [112]Peter Vischer the Younger,
   1527) and [113]John the Constant (by [114]Hans Vischer), and portraits
   of the reformers by [115]Lucas Cranach the Younger. St. Mary's Church,
   the parish church in which Luther often preached, was built in the
   fourteenth century, but has been much altered since Luther's time. It
   contains a magnificent painting by [116]Lucas Cranach the Elder,
   representing the Lord's Supper (with the faces of Luther and other
   reformers), Baptism and Confession, also a font by [117]Hermann Vischer
   the Elder (1457). In addition, there are numerous historic paintings in
   the church. The ancient electoral palace is another of the buildings
   that suffered severely in 1760; it now contains archives. There are
   also Melanchthon's house and the house of Lucas Cranach the elder
   (14721553), who was mayor of Wittenberg. Statues of Luther (by
   Schadow), Melanchthon and Bugenhagen embellish the town. The spot
   outside the Elster Gate where Luther publicly burned the papal bull in
   1520 is marked by an oak tree.

[[118]edit] Coat of arms

   Wittenberg's oldest [119]arms

   Wittenberg's civic [120]coat of arms conveys with its various heraldic
   elements something of the town's history. On [121]27 June 1293,
   Wittenberg was granted town rights by Duke Albrecht II. There then
   arose a mediaeval town whose highest governing body was its council.
   This council, known to have existed as early as 1317, was given the job
   of administering the town in its care through law and legislation, and
   of handling the town's revenue. For documentation, the administration
   used its own seal. One version of what is believed to be the town's
   oldest town seal, which the council used, and which dated from the
   first half of the 14th century, set the pattern with its elements for
   various civic coats of arms down to the present day.

   The coat of arms symbolizes, with its crenelated wall and the towers
   within and each side, a town that was already strongly fortified by
   1409. The two shields in the centre form the coat of arms of the
   Electorate of Saxony with the Saxon arms on the right, whose gold and
   black stripes recall the Ascanian rulers' house colours with the
   Rautenkranz (literally "lozenge wreath", although it is no such thing,
   as can be seen at the [122]Saxony article) across them symbolizing the
   town's founder Duke Albrecht II since 1262, when it appeared in his
   arms. The shield on the left is the Wittenberg district's arms. In
   1356, Emperor [123]Charles IV bestowed upon the Duke of
   Saxony-Wittenberg the honour of Elector. Wittenberg became an Electoral
   residence. The shield with its crossed swords stands for the office of
   "Arch-Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire" inextricably joined by the
   Electorate, brought to Wittenberg by Rudolf I. Both coats of arms
   continued to be used by the [124]Wettins after the Ascanians died out.
   The flowing water at the foot of the shield symbolizes Wittenberg's
   location on the river Elbe. The fish is a [125]salmon, which were once
   abundant in the Elbe. The [126]fishermen, like all professions in town,
   got their own order in 1422, and the fish found its way onto their coat
   of arms.

[[127]edit] Theatre and culture

   Wittenberg has a long tradition in cultural events. The City Theatre
   [128]Mitteldeutsches Landestheater reached a great importance in
   [129]GDR times. Since 1996, the City proposes Open-Air theatre shows
   based on the Lutheran history still alive in many historical places of
   the ancient town. As highlights, in 2001 and 2005, [130]Fernando Scarpa
   became the artistic director of the "Bhne Wittenberg" (Stage
   Wittenberg), a project for theatre, art and culture in the whole of
   Germany which attracts to the City plenty of audience and whose success
   achieves European echo. [131]Hamlet is said to have studied here.
