   1   "And Then There Were 10" December 27, 2005 101
   Near Earth, a battle between two space ships takes place. Clearly
   outmatched, the smaller of the two fires a laser at the larger ship's
   bridge and launches a pod to Earth amidst the confusion. The bridge
   explosion nearly kills the large ship's commander, [31]Vilgax, but the
   smaller ship appears to have been destroyed completely. On Earth,
   [32]Ben Tennyson begins his cross-country summer vacation with his
   cousin, [33]Gwen, and his grandpa, [34]Max. Ben finds the crashed pod
   at their first stop. Within it is a [35]watch-like alien artifact.
   Reaching to touch it, the watch jumps onto his wrist and refuses to
   come off, unwillingly merging with his DNA. Ben accidentally discovers
   that it can change his form into [36]various alien creatures and
   quickly learns how to use it. Deciding that he could be a superhero who
   can actually help people, Ben uses the watch to destroy robots sent by
   Vilgax to retrieve it, thus beginning a summer of adventure for
   himself, Max and Gwen.
   2   "Washington B.C."        January 13, 2006  102
   During a trip to [37]Washington D.C., Ben confronts [38]Dr. Animo, a
   disgruntled scientist whose Transmodulator can mutate living animals,
   and even resurrect dead ones, and eventually learns a lesson about what
   being a hero really means.
   3   "The Krakken"            January 14, 2006  103
   Ben encounters a lake monster called the [39]Krakken and [40]Captain
   Shaw, a fisherman obsessed with catching it. He soon finds out the
   creature is upset because [41]Jonah Melville, a poacher in the guise of
   an animal lover, is stealing the creature's eggs. After Ben retrieves
   the eggs, a close scene is shown with the [42]Krakken cuddling her
   regained eggs in her nest.
   4   "Permanent Retirement"   January 21, 2006  104
   Ben and Max drive to a retirement center to visit Ben's [43]Aunt Vera,
   but evil alien shape-shifters, called the [44]Limax, are kidnapping and
   replacing the elderly residents in order to devour them later.
   5   "Hunted"                 January 28, 2006  105
   Still in recovery, Vilgax hires three alien bounty hunters to retrieve
   the Omnitrix: a robotic crustacean named [45]Kraab, an assassin named
   [46]Sixsix, and a mysterious gunman named [47]Tetrax. The trio
   encounters Ben playing around with the watch and force him to flee.
   However, when Ben attempts to fight Tetrax, who had separated from the
   group, Tetrax reveals himself to be the same species as [48]Diamondhead
   and criticizes him for his lack of strategy while in combat. Proving
   himself to be on the good side, Tetrax aids Ben in warding off Kraab
   and Sixsix. Realizing that Ben took his words to heart, Tetrax decides
   to leave the Omnitrix with the child and awards him with a
   [49]hoverboard.
   6   "Tourist Trap"           February 4, 2006  106
   While in a tourist trap town called Sparksville, Ben plays a practical
   joke that accidentally unleashes [50]Megawatts, small creatures made
   from electrical energy, on the town. Ben must stop them from
   multiplying out of control and destroying the town with their dangerous
   pranks. Ben eventually turns to Heatblast to seal the Megawatts in the
   World's Largest Lightbulb.
   7   "Kevin 11"               February 11, 2006 107
   Straying from Max after an argument, Ben meets and befriends a boy
   named [51]Kevin, who has the power to absorb any form of energy. Their
   first misadventure forces Ben to reveal what the Omnitrix is capable
   of. Kevin suggests that they team up. However, Kevin just wants the
   Omnitrix's power at his disposal; being treated like a monster for his
   strange powers since birth, Kevin had let hatred build up in his heart
   and is now out to get back at those who had hurt him. Ben attempts to
   reason with Kevin but ends up fighting him as [52]Heatblast
   vs.[53]Fireblast, at which point Kevin escapes and Max finds Ben. Ben
   finds Kevin terrorizing some bullies with energy stolen from Heatblast
   and fights him as [54]Fourarms. Ben defeats Kevin(who battled as
   [55]Sixarms) this time, forcing him to flee. Unknown to Ben, however,
   Kevin had absorbed energy from the Omnitrix after all.
   8   "The Alliance"           February 18, 2006 108
   Fourarms reluctantly fights a female thief named [56]Joey and her gang,
   but Vilgax sends more attack drones at the same time. While Ben shifts
   his attention to the drones, Joey attacks Max. Ben destroys the robots
   and knocks Joey out, leaving them all at the scene in order to get Max
   to a hospital. While he is away, the drones fuse with Joey,
   transforming her into a semi-robotic being called Rojo. Vilgax makes
   telepathic contact with Rojo through the drones and commands her to
   steal the Omnitrix. At the hospital, Ben realizes that his watch makes
   him a constant target and puts Gwen and Max in danger by association;
   worried for their safety, Ben runs away. He later encounters Rojo and
   fights her as [57]XLR8, which proves futile. With advice from Max via
   cell phone, Ben defeats Rojo as [58]Upgrade by merging with and
   shorting out her robotic parts. In the process, Vilgax makes telepathic
   contact with Upgrade through the drones and threatens him, claiming
   that he will obtain the Omnitrix some day. Ben returns to Max and Gwen
   upon the realization that he needs them. Max tells Ben not to worry
   about what Vilgax said; however, Max expresses a look of anxiousness
   while Ben is out of sight.
   9   "Last Laugh"             February 25, 2006 109
   While visiting a travelling circus, Ben fights an evil clown named
   [59]Zombozo, who drains the souls of everyone watching through their
   laughter, all the while inhibited by a [60]coulrophobia. Conquering his
   own fear, Ben defeats Zombozo by terrifying him as [61]Ghostfreak and
   saves his family from the evil clown's soul draining machine. During
   this fight, Ben first notes that he scared himself while fighting as
   Ghostfreak.
   10  "Lucky Girl"             March 4, 2006     110
   Ben defeats a magician named [62]Hex as he attempts to steal a
   spellbook. During the fight Ben retrieves one of Hex's five magical
   Charms of Bezel and gives it to Gwen. The charm gives Gwen the power of
   [63]probability manipulation. Using a [64]Mardi Gras costume, Gwen
   becomes a new superheroine named "Lucky Girl," and begins stealing the
   spotlight from Ben while proving she's also got what it takes to be a
   crime-fighter. Unfortunately, Hex wants his charm back. He takes the
   spellbook and lures Gwen into a trap. He is able to take back his charm
   and begins an incantation to suck the entire city of New Orleans into a
   vortex. Fortunately, Gwen catches him off guard and takes back the
   Charms of Bezel, smashing them so that they may never be used again for
   any evil purposes. Fourarms restrains Hex until he is arrested.
   11  "A Small Problem"        March 11, 2006    111
   In a fit of stubbornness, the Omnitrix transforms Ben into [65]Grey
   Matter and leaves him stuck in that form for far longer than normal.
   During this time, Grey Matter is captured by an alien-obsessed nerd
   named [66]Howell Wayneright. Grey Matter successfully contacts Gwen and
   Max for a short period before a secret society of modern knights, known
   as [67]The Organization, retrieves both Grey Matter and Howell. The two
   work together to escape and quickly discover a room filled with
   extraterrestrial technology, with which The Organization could take
   over the world. Grey Matter sabotages one of the objects to trigger an
   explosion and take down The Organization's base. Enoch, The
   Organization's leader, orders his men to find information on Ben and
   his family.

   celebrating stopping an attempted robbery by having an ice cream
   party.

   With his wounds finally healed, Vilgax decides to personally retrieve
   the Omnitrix. He again contacts Ben in a dream, which Ben tells Max
   about. Worried, Max plots a course to [70]Mount Rushmore. Ben ignores
   Max's warnings not to go alien and flies off to stop trouble along the
   way, only to engage in combat with Vilgax. After a futile struggle,
   Vilgax captures Ben and brings him aboard his ship. Having retrieved
   weapons from a [71]secret base in Mount Rushmore, Max and Gwen free Ben
   from Vilgax's extraction device. Ben and Vilgax fight again, but Ben
   surrenders when Vilgax holds Max and Gwen hostage. Unknown to either of
   them, Max had activated a self-destruct command on Vilgax's ship. Ben

   14 "Truth" May 29, 2006 201
   After the incident with Vilgax, Max tells Ben and Gwen about his secret
   past. He really was a plumber, but not the garden variety version. He
   was part of a secret government organization known as "The Plumbers,"
   that dealt with extra-terrestrial and paranormal phenomenon that others
   couldn't. The organization was disbanded after he defeated Vilgax for
   the first time. During one of Ben's regular acts of heroism, they run
   into Max's old partner, Phil. Phil is still in the business of hunting
   aliens, though he is now a freelance agent. He suggests that they
   remake The Plumbers, but Max is against the idea. Ben, however, is much
   more enthusiastic about the idea. During another alien battle, Ben
   reveals the secret of the Omnitrix to Phil, and Phil is even more
   determined to get him as a partner. Phil ends up taking them to an
   expensive hotel, which he is able to pay for thanks to rewards for
   capturing the aliens. The frequency of the alien attacks, as well as
   the familiar aliens themselves, raises Max's suspicions, and he heads
   to Mount Rushmore to check on something. There, he finds the Null Void
   Projectora weapon that can trap things in, or release them from, an
   alternate dimensionmissing. Phil has been abusing it to scam various
   hotel owners into paying him to remove the aliens that he sets free.
   Phil releases an alien to deal with Max, but Ben is able to rescue him
   and eventually trap Phil in the Null Void.
   15 "The Big Tick" May 30, 2006 202
   During a trip to [73]Yellowstone National Park, Ben discovers a new
   form on the Omnitrix: [74]Cannonbolt, an armadillo- and beetle-like
   alien. At the same time, a meteor crashes nearby unleashing a giant,
   [75]tick-like alien called the "[76]Great One" that intends to devour
   the planet. On top of that, it has its very own [77]worshipers, who
   intend to make sure it completes its task. Ben easily defeats the
   worshippers, but the Great One is impervious to all of his original
   alien forms. Since nothing else works, Ben has to rely on a form he
   knows nothing about in order to defeat the Great One. He quickly
   discovers that Cannonbolt is impervious from any attack when rolled
   into an armored ball and penetrates the Great One's armor in that form,
   killing the alien from the inside. The worshipers proclaim Ben the new
   Great One, but change their minds once he reverts back to normal.
   16 "Framed" May 31, 2006 203
   In San Francisco, Ben discovers that look-alikes of his aliens are
   committing crimes around the city. Ben encounters the imposter and
   discovers that it was really Kevin; their last battle has permanently
   given Kevin the ability to transform into the various aliens of the
   Omnitrix. Kevin leaves Ben to pay for his own crimes performed as
   Omnitrix aliens, bringing Ben into direct conflict with [78]Lt. Steel
   of the government's Special Alien Capture Team. Evading Steel, Fourarms
   confronts Kevin atop the Golden Gate Bridge. Kevin loses control of the
   Omnitrix's powers during the battle, prompting Ben to walk away.
   Kevin's rage at the loss forces one final transformation: a fusion of
   all of the Omnitrix aliens without the ability to revert to human form.
   Blaming Ben for the mess, Kevin vows to kill Ben once and for all.
   Fourarms is no match for the new mutation. Fortunately, Steel had
   observed the battle and conversation and decides that Kevin is the
   enemy, knocking him into the water below. Ben and the Tennysons leave
   the scene with approval from Steel.
   17 "Gwen 10" June 1, 2006 204
   This episode is a "What If?" scenario that is separate from the main
   story. When Ben wakes up one morning, he finds the Omnitrix missing
   from his arm. Weirder still is the fact that Gwen and Grandpa Max have
   no idea what he's talking about when he asks about it. Ben soon
   discovers that he's actually reliving the very first day of summer, the
   same day that Ben found the Omnitrix to begin with, but in an alternate
   reality. At the campsite, Ben tries to find the Omnitrix as it crashes
   to Earth, only to find out that it has already been found by Gwen. Gwen
   quickly adjusts to the Omnitrix's powers, with much greater skill than
   Ben. However, unlike the first episode Vilgax was not injured at all
   earlier and is already heading for Earth to take it back from her,
   preferably in a very painful way. Ben's going to have to prove himself
   to be a hero without the Omnitrix to back him up if he wants to save
   Gwen.
   18 "Grudge Match" June 7, 2006 205
   [79]Diamondhead battles the still-mutated Kevin, who had rendered Gwen
   and Max unconscious. A droid named [80]Slix Vigma observes their fight,
   recognizing them as potential gladiators. Amidst the combat, a
   teleportation beam takes Diamondhead and Kevin to a huge ship called
   the Mega Cruiser, where life or death gladiator matches are regularly
   held between slaves captured from different alien races. There, Vigma
   makes Ben and Kevin a team, bonding them with shackles that transfer
   pain from one to the other. With no choice, Ben and Kevin battle
   another captive, [81]Technorg, during which Ben teaches Kevin new
   attacks combining Omnitrix alien abilities in order to win. Though
   Kevin intends to kill Technorg, Ben restrains him and spares his
   opponent's life. After the fight, Ben and Kevin rally the other
   prisoners, who nearly all escape. However, Kevin traps Ben with the
   intent to kill, revealing that he still bears a grudge. Fortunately,
   Technorg abides by a code of honor and saves Ben, sending him back to
   Earth. Kevin is left aboard the Mega Cruiser with Technorg.
   19 "The Galactic Enforcers" June 13, 2006 206
   When a pair of bounty hunters plan to use raw minerals from earth to
   build a devastatingly powerful bomb, Ben joins a group of alien super
   heroes, the Galactic Enforcers, in order to stop them. However, all is
   not well with the new group, as a small gift of Ben's chocolate is all
   that's needed to weaken the group's leader, Ultimos. This causes his
   second, Synaptak, to take the lead in order to try showing Ben up.
   However, the Enforcers tactics involving 'commanding presence' backfire
   on them, and nearly getting Tini hurt in the process. However, after
   Ben goades Synaptak into rescuing Tini from a landslide, Ben and the
   Enforcers put aside their differences to finally arrest the bounty
   hunters.
   20 "Camp Fear" June 21, 2006 207
   Distracted by Ben and Gwen quarreling, Max almost hits a [82]young
   camper on the road. They take the boy back to his camp, Camp Opinicon,
   only to find no one there. As they investigate the premises, they find
   two more children, [83]twins, who are hiding from something that caused
   the camp to become deserted. Max is captured by tendrils while he
   investigates, prompting Ben and Gwen to split up. While Gwen leads the
   campers to safety from fungal mutants, Ben attempts two failed rescue
   missions, getting captured on the second. In trying to escape, Ben
   unlocks a new alien form, a plant-like alien named [84]Wildvine;
   however, even Wildvine cannot defeat the [85]brain that controls the
   fungal creatures. Fortunately, Ben drops his shoe, which has
   [86]athletes foot powder in it onto the brain and causes it and its
   minions to wither. Ben and Gwen spread more of the antifungal powder on
   its tendrils and save the camp.
   21 "Ultimate Weapon" July 6, 2006 208
   Max's Plumber equipment detects that an ancient mask had been
   unearthed. This quickly triggers a change in Max's attitude; he claims
   that this artifact would lead to the most powerful weapon ever
   designed, and that he should retrieve it before it falls into the wrong
   hands. Max immediately becomes more impatient, worse-tempered, and far
   stricter. Upon retrieving the mask, the Tennysons come into conflict
   with The Orgainization, now called the Forever Knights, who want to
   find the weapon themselves. The Tennysons end up with the mask after a
   struggle and use it to find the ultimate weapon, the Sword of Ekchuah,
   inside of a [87]Mayan pyramid. There, Fourarms faces off against the
   Mayan death god Ah Puch while the Forever Knights fight Max for the
   sword. In a painstaking decision, Max decides to save his family
   instead of claiming the weapon, realizing which was more important. His
   choice was not in vain, as the antique sword crumbles to dust once
   Enoch takes it. The temple collapses, and though Max warns Enoch not to
   stay, Enoch remains inside in an attempt to collect the dust that was
   once the ultimate weapon.
   22 "Tough Luck" July 12, 2006 209
   Gwen dons her Lucky Girl costume again upon finding the Keystone of
   Bezel at a convention in Las Vegas. Rather than magical luck, the
   Keystone increases all of Gwen's natural abilities, making her a more
   efficient and powerful heroine. At the same time, Hex has been busted
   out of prison by his niece, [88]Charmcaster, and seeks to use the
   keystone to restore the destroyed charms. Charmcaster tricks Gwen into
   trusting her so that she could easily take the Keystone and give it to
   Hex. However, Charmcaster double-crosses her uncle so that she can take
   the Charms power for herself. Wildvine stops the recreation process and
   Gwen defeats Charmcaster herself. To do so, she instinctively fires an
   energy blast from Hex's staff which suggests an affinity for magic.
   23 "They Lurk Below" July 18, 2006 210
   The family ride a jet belonging to Grandpa Max's old Friend, Donovan
   Grand Smith, who owns an underwater resort. At the entrance, they
   receive a warm welcome from Donovan himself, though they also meet with
   his grandson, Edwin, who didn't seem to be excited about their guests.
   Later, when Edwin, Ben, and Gwen enter the Undersea Manta Ray, a giant
   submarine, they encounter strange aliens that threatened to destroy the
   whole resort. While the kids find a way to cooperate with each other to
   find the source that lures them in, Donovan himself learns a few
   lessons in how to bond better with his grandson.
   24 "Ghostfreaked Out" July 25, 2006 211
   Lately, Ben has been having strange nightmares about Ghostfreak. During
   a tour of a school Gwen wishes to attend, Ben sees and hears Ghostfreak
   everywhere, and bad luck follows him around. When Frightwig, Acid
   Breath, and Thumbskull show up, Ben activates his Omnitrix; however, it
   transforms him into Ghostfreak. After a vicious battle, during which
   Ben is clearly no longer in control, Ghostfreak escapes from the
   Omnitrix. [89]Ghostfreak removes his second layer of skin in order to
   [90]possess Ben, revealing a horrifying creature underneath. As a side
   effect of removing it, though, he can no longer withstand sunlight and
   is forced to retreat. Ghostfreak scares the circus trio into working
   for him as he schemes to possess Ben and gain control of the Omnitrix.
   Ben and family encounter Ghostfreak and his minions that night. Gwen
   and Max easily deal with the circus trio, but he has Ben on the run. As
   Ghostfreak prepares to possess him, Ben pulls back the curtains in the
   room while the sun is rising, incinerating him.
   25 "Dr. Animo and the Mutant Ray" August 25, 2006 212
   When Ben tries to take apart the Omnitrix to see how it works, he ends
   up breaking off its face and causing weird combinations of his alien
   forms when he transforms. Additionally, the broken piece begins
   mutating the smaller creatures it comes into contact with. Meanwhile,
   Dr. Animo escapes from prison and, during a battle with Ben, finds the
   broken piece of the Omnitrix. Using it, he is able to complete his
   large-scale Transmodulator, giving him the power to mutate the entire
   planet in a single shot.Combinations: Stinkarms, Diamondmatter,
   Heatjaws:).
   26 "Back With a Vengeance" October 9, 2006 213
   Ben accidentally figures out the master control of the Omnitrix,
   allowing him to become any alien just by thinking about it, and stay an
   alien indefinitely. Elsewhere, Kevin had assumed control of the
   Megacruiser. Using it to navigate the Universe, he locates and revives
   Vilgax. The two battle, but Vilgax quickly realizes the nature of
   Kevin's mutation and decides that he may be of use. Kevin and Vilgax
   locate Ben and fight to a stalemate. Max attempts to trap the enemies
   in the Null Void dimension; however, Ben gets pulled in as well and
   ends up continuing his battle in another realm. Gwen enters the Null
   Void in order to retrieve Ben. Unfortunately, Kevin takes her hostage,
   forcing Ben to give away the Omnitrix in order to save her. But before
   anyone can escape, Kevin double-crosses Vilgax. Ben and Gwen procure
   the Omnitrix in the resulting brawl and leave the villains trapped in
   the Null Void dimension. Ben reattaches the Omnitrix, only to realize
   that he had zeroed out the master control and can no longer perform
   mind-accessed transformations.

   audience. Even though he is stopped by Gwen, the trouble doesn't end
   there. Sublimino is able to use those he hypnotizes to commit crimes in
   their [92]dream state, and the alien-equipped Ben proves to be the

   Ben and Max and tries to cook up another body-transfer spell. Gwen

   equipment for an unknown reason. One of [96]Max's old friends believes
   it to be a [97]Yenaldooshi, or [98]Navajo werewolf, a sign of pure
   evil. Wildvine fights the creature, but it bites Wildvine's root just
   before Ben returns to normal. It nearly kills Ben as a human, but he is
   spared when the wolf accidentally scratches the Omnitrix rather than
   Ben himself. Afterwards, Ben begins transforming into a werewolf
   himself, presumably an effect of the bite. The others hurry to kill the
   werewolf before Ben's transformation is complete. However, they
   discover that werewolf is actually an alien. By scratching the
   Omnitrix, it added its own DNA to the Omnitrix, which was gradually
   shifting Ben into [99]that form. Upon reverting back to human form some
   time later, Ben fights the werewolf as Cannonbolt inside an active
   volcano, sealing it within. The group is unable to find the missing
   equipment, but assume the threat to be over. However, the alien had
   finished building a transmitter from the parts he salvaged, and it
   activates on its own.
   32 "Game Over" February 24, 2007 306
   Ben and Gwen are playing Sumo Slammer video game and Gwen is beating
   Ben at it. As a result, Ben turns into Upgrade and merges with the
   computer so he can lower Gwen's score. As Gwen tries to get Ben out,
   lightning hits the van and zaps them both into the game. It isn't long
   before they realize that all of the aliens in the Omnitrix are
   unavailable and they have to collect tokens in order to activate
   certain ones. They progress through the levels in order to get the
   Upgrade token and allow them to leave the game. However, the villain of
   the game hears them, and wants to use the Upgrade token to leave the
   game and take over the real world.
   33 "Super Alien Hero Buddy Adventures" March 3, 2007 308
   When a television show called Super Alien Hero Buddy Adventures, which
   stars corny cartoon versions of Fourarms, Heatblast, and [100]Wildmutt,
   shows up, Ben wants credit. Furthermore, it has replaced his favorite
   show, Kangaroo Commando. It just so happens Ben and Gwen are visiting
   Planetary Studios at the time, so he tries to confront the producer
   about it. Meanwhile, strange accidents begin occurring around the actor
   who plays The Commando, conveniently allowing the actor to save the
   day. The Commando suspects that the artist producing the cartoon, Tim
   Dean, is responsible, but Gwen suspects foul play on the Commando's
   part.
   34 "Under Wraps" March 10, 2007 309
   In order to teach Ben and Gwen the value of hard work, Grandpa Max
   takes them to a farm. However, a farmhand tells Ben and Gwen of a
   [101]mummy that had recently arrived in a flash of purple lightning,
   prompting their curiosity. The two of them find it digging for a
   strange stone, but it attacks them as soon as they see it. XLR8 fights
   it to no avail, but the mummy flees in the confusion. Max discovers
   that the strange rock is an unstable chemical called "Corrodium," which
   causes severe mutation in earthly organisms. The Tennysons track the
   mummy down to an ice cream factory, but end up in danger when the mummy
   proves to be invincible. In the resulting struggle, the mummy touches
   the Omnitrix and inadvertently adds its DNA, allowing Ben to use
   [102]that form; however, the Omnitrix decides to transform Ben into
   Upgrade instead. Upgrade possesses a [103]liquid nitrogen containment
   tank and sprays the mummy with the chemical, effectively freezing it.
   The family then flees the farm for fear of more manual labor.
   35 "The Unnaturals" March 17, 2007 310
   Ben goes to see his favorite [104]Little League team, and discovers
   their opponents, the [105]Squires, are [106]robots. He cheats for his
   own team, but it works against them when the robots try to kidnap
   people on the team who appeared to be experts due to Ben's help. While
   attempting a rescue, Ben discovers that the robots plans are to replace
   the [107]President of the United States, who had also been watching the
   game. The Tennysons foil the Squires' plan and personally save the
   [108]president. After they have left, Enoch appears, revealing the plan
   to be his own. He vows that the Tennysons will pay with their lives.
   36 "Monster Weather" March 24, 2007 307

   37 "[109]The Return" April 7, 2007 311
   A shuttle launch at [110]NASA is interrupted by a purple lightning
   storm. This attracts the attention of Ben, Gwen, and Max, who hope to
   discover the origin of the alien werewolf and mummy. While at NASA, Ben
   runs into an ill-tempered scientist by the name of [111]Dr. Vicktor.
   Surveillance tapes associate him with the purple lightning storm, and
   he is quickly shown to be in cahoots with the two creatures. Ben, Gwen,
   and Max encounter the creatures again, in addition to Doctor Vicktor in
   his true form. Following a losing battle, the Tennysons split up: Max
   and Gwen board the space shuttle that Doctor Vicktor launches, and Ben
   follows Vicktor as XLR8. The mummy's onboard the space shuttle, and
   Vicktor sends the werewolf to New Mexico in a flash of purple lightning
   through use of a teleportation device. But as Ben confronts Dr.
   Vicktor, the scientist reveals that he is not carrying out his own
   plan. To Ben's horror, Vicktor revives his master: Ghostfreak.
   38 "[112]Be Afraid of the Dark" April 14, 2007 312
   From where the "The Return" left off, Ben is now facing both a revived
   Ghostfreak and Doctor Vicktor, quickly transforming into Grey Matter to
   escape. Grey Matter is able to discern Ghostfreak's plan from a
   computer terminal: Using the corrodium to amplify the power source of
   the orbiting space station, in conjunction with the device the alien
   werewolf built in New Mexico, Ghostfreak is intent on covering the
   daylight side of the Earth in a corrodium shield. This will not only
   mutate Earth's population, but it will also block out the sun, giving
   Ghostfreak a world of eternal darkness to rule over. Ben uses Upgrade
   to create a makeshift rocket to get to the space station, which Vicktor
   clings to so that he might also get to the station. Meanwhile, Max and
   Gwen fight the mummy aboard the space center and attempt to thwart
   Ghostfreak's plan from there. Upgrade seemingly defeats the mummy, but
   Ghostfreak appears again and manually starts the device. In pure
   darkness, Ghostfreak's form enhances; Ben's new [113]Benvicktor form
   holds him off until doctor Vicktor came back. However, Max tricks
   Vicktor into destroy the projector, ruining Ghostfreak's plan and
   apparently killing the werewolf. In a fit of rage, Vicktor attempts to
   warp Ben away, but accidentally banishes himself and the mummy. Ben and
   Gwen escape with Max on the shuttle, on which they again expose
   Ghostfreak to sunlight and defeat him. Cannonbolt protects Gwen and Max
   from [114]atmospheric reentry, and the three land in Egypt. In the
   aftermath of the attack, Ben realizes that he has gained Ghostfreak's
   natural form on the Omnitrix.
   39 "The Visitor" April 21, 2007 313
   Two snowmobilers accidentally release an alien named [115]Xylene from a
   strange container. Xylene locates the Omnitrix and attacks Ben, under
   the impression that he had stolen it. However, when Max comes to
   defend, the two recognize each other as old friends. Xylene and Max
   reminisce later that night. As Wildvine spies on them, Xylene asks Max
   to leave Earth and travel through the [116]Universe with her.
   Distraught, Ben runs back to the campsite, where he is unable to ward
   off an attack by one of Vilgax's remaining drones and has to rely on
   Max and Xylene for help. There, Xylene reveals that she was the
   commander of the ship bringing the Omnitrix to Earth when Vilgax
   attacked it, and that she had intended to send it to Max; Ben received
   the Omnitrix by accident. Ben runs off in shock and Gwen follows. The
   drone attacks again and captures Max. Ben and Xylene reluctantly team
   up to save him. In the process, Xylene uses her knowledge of the
   Omnitrix to unlock a new form, [117]Upchuck, which Ben uses to destroy
   the robot. At that, Xylene prepares to leave the planet and repeats her
   offer to Max. Max declines, claiming that Ben and Gwen are his whole
   world.

   exploiting his alien DNA for his own evil purposes. Using the alien

   Bucket. While Grandpa Max tries desperately to track down the Rust
   Bucket, the Road Crew give it a makeover for use in their plans. The

   Plumbers by an alien race. they lose the keys to the villains, and

   however).

   from Ben. All four Tennysons (Ben's father helps) fight off Vilgax's
   drones running amok in the city. When Vilgax appears again, easily
