[[87]edit] History

   The first settlers of Hopkins arrived in 1852^[88][3] as land around
   the growing [89]Minneapolis-St. Paul area was opening up and being
   explored by members stationed at [90]Fort Snelling. However, the roots
   of the town begin in 1887 with the building of the [91]Minneapolis
   Threshing Machine Company, later called [92]Minneapolis-Moline, to make
   farm equipment . At the time, Minneapolis Moline employed most of the
   Hopkins residents. In 1887, the West Minneapolis Land Company was
   founded and formed to build housing for the Minneapolis Moline factory
   workers.

   Until 1893, Hopkins was part of [93]Minneapolis. That year, residents
   of Hopkins sent the [94]Hennepin County Board of Commissioners a
   petition signed by 41 residents, asking that a separate [95]village be
   formed. Following an election, the community was then incorporated as
   the village of West Minneapolis with a population of 1,105. The
   original village consisted of about three square miles, and it has been
   enlarged by annexation to its present size of about four square miles.

   In 1928, the name of the village was changed to Hopkins after Harley H.
   Hopkins, who was among its first [96]homesteaders and was the
   community's first [97]postmaster. Mr. Hopkins allowed the town to build
   the train depot on his land (now [98]The Depot Coffee House) with the
   agreement that the train station would say "Hopkins" on it. People
   getting off the train assumed the name of the town was Hopkins and it
   stuck. On [99]January 1, [100]1948, the village became a [101]city upon
   adoption of what is called the council-city manager charter.
