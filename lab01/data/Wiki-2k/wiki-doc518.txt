   (April 2007)

   Dunst is a [14]queer [15]performance art and [16]activist group in
   [17]Copenhagen, [18]Denmark. The group began in 2001 as an informal
   [19]human network, but since 2004 it formally works as an association.
   Among its projects are art shows, dinner nights, performances, film
   nights, parties and political manifestations, as well as tv and radio
   shows. The name means [20]odour or reek in [21]Danish.

[[27]edit] Activities

   During 2003, Dunst handled the Gay House at [28]Christiania. Events and
   parties in the revived Gay House were popular among Copenhagen's gays,
   but Dunst allegedly received complaints and threats from Christiania
   residents and subsequently moved out of Christiania.^[29][1]^[30][2]

   During 2003 Dunst broadcast six episodes of its own TV show on
   [31]Kanal Kbenhavn, a local Copenhagen [32]television network. The
   network, however, declined to air an episode showing one artist eating
   excrement and subsequently banned Dunst from its facilities. Dunst
   currently broadcasts a weekly radio show on the local cable network.

   Dunst has made events in neighbouring countries and has gained some
   international attention, notably in [33]Berlin.^[[34]citation needed]

[[35]edit] Style and context

   Dunst is known for its bizarre and ironic [36]drag queen personalities
   (including such names as Ramona Macho, Miss Fish, Puta and Tove
   Hansen). Having decidedly anti-[37]establishment aims, the group has a
   humorous approach with a [38]drag-[39]punk flavour. Public appearances
   have been referred in several mainstream media which would otherwise
   often ignore gay events.^[40][3]

   The attitude of Dunst appears more sarcastic and less militant than
   radical [41]queer punk formations in other countries. It could be
   claimed that Dunst combines a [42]postmodern appearance with a Danish
   tradition of humorous political [43]activism.^[[44]citation needed]
   During the 1970s and 1980s, the theatre group Solvognen (Sun Chariot,
   linked with Christiania), singers Troels Trier and Rebecca Brel, and
   the squatter performance network Kulrte Klat ("Coloured Blob") made
   imaginative and ironic performances, as well as [45]feminist groups of
   rdstrmper (literally "[46]Redstockings").

[[47]edit] Manifesto

   The Dunst website proclaims its "Manifesto" as follows:^[48][4]

     1. dunst is for all the cute ones. 2. dunst is the culture bearing
     layer of our gender political confusement. 3. dunst has provocation
     as a work tool and not as a goal in itself. 4. dunst makes contrasts
     strong. 5. dunst is for all who in a self performance will go beyond
     their own modesty. 6. dunst is the low life that others won't have
     an opinion about. 7. dunst is the sanctuary for those who come from
     a male or female [49]chauvinist upbringing. 8. dunst crosses the
     gender specific habits and limits you keep in your everyday life. 9.
     dunst is for those who think they and others should be culturally
     carpet bombed. 10. dunst is always in change.
