   Ego death is an experience that reveals the illusory aspect of the ego,
   sometimes undergone by [19]psychonauts, [20]mystics, [21]shamans,
   [22]monks, [23]psychologists, and others interested in exploring the
   depths of the [24]mind.

   The practice of ego death as a deliberately sought "[25]mystical
   experience" in some ways overlaps, but is nevertheless distinct from,
   traditional teachings concerning [26]enlightenment/"[27]Nirvana" (in
   [28]Buddhism) or "[29]Moksha" (in [30]Hinduism), which might perhaps be
   better understood as transcendence of the notion that one even has any
   actual, non-illusory "[31]ego" with which to experience "death" in the
   first place.

[[36]edit] Methods of inducing of the experience

   The most direct means of accomplishing the [37]mystical experience of
   ego death may be through the use of [38]psychedelics^[39][1] such as
   [40]LSD, [41]DMT, [42]DXM, [43]psilocybin, [44]mescaline, [45]nitrous
   oxide, [46]Lysergic acid amide. Many other methods, practices, or
   experiences may also induce this state, including [47]prayer,
   [48]sacred ritual, [49]sleep deprivation, [50]fasting, and
   [51]meditation practice. Less frequently, it might also come about
   spontaneously or "of its own accord" (as a symptom of certain
   [52]mental illnesses, or in response to severe [53]trauma).

   There are a variety of schools of thought about the aim, practice, and
   interpretation of the ego death experience. According to one person,
   for example (see [54]egodeath.com) it is to be characterized as the
   perceived loss of boundaries between self and environment, a sense of
   the loss of "control," the loss of the accustomed feeling of existing
   as a "personal agent," loose "cognitive-association binding," and even

     ...a sense of being controlled by frozen block-universe determinism
     with a single, pre-existing, ever-existing future. Experiencing this
     model of control and time initially destabilizes self-control power,
     and amounts to the death of the self that was conceived of as an
     autonomous control-agent. Self-control stability is restored upon
     transforming one's mental model to take into account the dependence
     of personal control on a hidden, separate thought-source, such as
     Necessity or a divine level that transcends Necessity.^[55][2]

   It should also be noted, within the context of this system, that ego
   death is not [56]actual death itself, but rather a temporary state of
   mind which can be stabilised and reverted. This can be done either by
   thought-source control for any who have achieved the state, as well as
   by de-intoxication for those who have reached the state using
   [57]psychedelics.

   However, there are, again, at least as many [58]points of view about
   the nature of ego death as there are [59]mystics, [60]psychonauts, etc.
   who have had the experience.^[[61]citation needed] (Some, for example,
   may even go so far as to agree with the poet [62]Dylan Thomas who said,
   "after the first death, there is no other."^[63][3]) It can also be
   argued that experiencing ego death is not possible because an ego is a
   functional necessity of experience and hence experience does not occur
   after ego death. Unless ones contemplation (while not ceasing to exist)
   is focused and or completely absorbed into an infinite object.
   Meditation on a blank or white-out state of consciousness would also
   have the same effect.
