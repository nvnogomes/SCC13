[[36]edit] Life

[[37]edit] Early life and career

   He was born at [38]Abingdon in [39]Berkshire (now [40]Oxfordshire), (7
   miles south of [41]Oxford, England), circa 1175.

   'Rich' was an epithet sometimes given to his wealthy merchant father.
   It was never applied to Edmund or his siblings in their lifetimes.
   Edmund may have been educated at the monastic school in [42]Abingdon.
   He studied at the [43]universities of Oxford and [44]Paris and became a
   teacher about 1200, or a little earlier. For six years he lectured on
   [45]mathematics and [46]dialectics, apparently dividing his time
   between Oxford and Paris, and winning distinction for his part in
   introducing the study of [47]Aristotle. He is the first known Oxford
   [48]Master of Arts and the site where he lived and taught was formed
   into a mediaeval academic hall in his name and eventually incorporated
   as the current college [49]St Edmund Hall. Through the influence of a
   pious mother he had led from boyhood a life of self-denial and
   austerity; and it is not surprising that he tired of secular subjects
   and went over to [50]theology.

   Though for some time he resisted the change, he finally entered upon
   his new career between 1205 and 1210. He received ordination, took a
   doctorate in divinity, and soon won fame as a lecturer on theology and
   as an extemporaneou
