Donkey pronoun

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Donkey anaphor)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   A donkey pronoun is a pronoun that is [9]bound in [10]semantics but not
   [11]syntax.^[12][1]^[13][2] Some writers prefer the term donkey
   anaphora, since it is the [14]referential aspects and [15]discourse or
   [16]syntactic context that are of interest to researchers (see
   [17]anaphora). The terms d-type or e-type pronoun are also used,
   [18]mutually exclusively, dependent on theoretical approach to
   [19]interpretation. A sentence containing a donkey pronoun is sometimes
   called a [20]donkey sentence.

   The term donkey pronoun was coined from a [21]counterexample provided
   by [22]Peter Geach (1962) to [23]Richard Montague's proposal for a
   generalized formal representation of [24]quantification in [25]natural
   language. The example was reused by [26]David Lewis (1975), [27]Gareth
   Evans (1977) and many others, and is still quoted in recent
   publications. The original donkey sentence is as follows.
     * Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it. [28]Peter Geach, Reference
       and Generality

   This sentence is significant because it represents a class of
   well-formed natural language sentences that defy straight-forward
   attempts to generate their [29]formal language equivalents. The
   difficulty is with understanding how English speakers [30]parse the
   scope of quantification in such sentences.^[31][3] Additionally, the
   [32]indefinite article 'a' is normally understood as an [33]existential
   quantifier, but the most natural reading of the donkey sentence
   requires it to be understood as a nested [34]universal quantifier.
   There are other features of the sentence that require careful
   consideration for adequate description.

   The donkey pronoun in the example sentence is the word it.

   There is nothing "wrong" with donkey sentences. They are grammatically
   "correct", they are well-formed, their syntax is regular. They are also
   logically meaningful, they have well-defined [35]truth conditions,
   their semantics is unambiguous. It is precisely this that makes them
   interesting. The difficulty is with explaining how syntactic elements
   give rise to the semantic result; and in a way that generalizes
   consistently with all other language use. Then, for example, we could
   program a computer to accurately translate natural language forms into
   [36]logical form.^[37][4] The question is, how are natural language
   users, apparently effortlessly, agreeing on the meaning of sentences
   like these?

   There may be several equivalent ways of describing this process. In
   fact, [38]Hans Kamp (1981) and [39]Irene Heim (1982) independently
   proposed very similar accounts in different terminology, which they
   called [40]discourse representation theory (DRT) and [41]file change
   semantics (FCS) respectively.

   In 2007, Adrian Brasoveanu published studies of donkey pronoun analogs
   in [42]Hindi, and analysis of complex and [43]modal versions of donkey
   pronouns in English.

[[49]edit] Discourse Representation Theory

   Donkey sentences became a major force in advancing [50]semantic
   research in the 1980s, with the introduction of [51]discourse
   representation theory (DRT). During that time, an effort was made to
   settle the inconsistencies which arose from the attempts to translate
   donkey sentences into [52]first-order logic.

   Donkey sentences present the following problem, when represented in
   first-order logic: The systematic translation of every existential
   expression in the sentence into existential quantifiers produces an
   incorrect representation of the sentence, since it leaves a free
   occurrence of the variable y in BEAT(x.y):

          \forall x\, (\text{FARMER} (x) \and \exists y \,(
          \text{DONKEY}(y) \and \text{OWNS}(x,y)) \rightarrow
          \text{BEAT}(x,y))

   Trying to extend the scope of existential quantifier also does not
   solve the problem:

          \forall x \,\exists y\, (\text{FARMER} (x) \and \text{DONKEY}(y)
          \and \text{OWNS}(x,y) \rightarrow \text{BEAT}(x,y))

   In this case, the logical translation fails to give correct truth
   conditions to donkey sentences: Imagine a situation where there is a
   farmer owning a donkey and a pig, and not beating any of them. The
   formula will be true in that situation, because for each farmer we need
   to find at least one object that either is not a donkey owned by this
   farmer, or is beaten by the farmer. Hence, if this object denotes the
   pig, the sentence will be true in that situation.

   A correct translation into first-order logic for the donkey sentence
   seems to be:

          \forall x\, \forall y\, (\text{FARMER} (x) \and \text{DONKEY}(y)
          \and \text{OWNS}(x,y) \rightarrow \text{BEAT}(x,y))

   Unfortunately, this translation leads to a serious problem of
   inconsistency. Indefinites must sometimes be interpreted as existential
   quantifiers, and other times as universal quantifiers, without any
   apparent regularity.

   The solution that [53]DRT provides for the donkey sentence problem can
   be roughly outlined as follows: The common semantic function of
   non-anaphoric [54]noun phrases is the introduction of a new
   [55]discourse referent, which is in turn available for the binding of
   anaphoric expressions. No quantifiers are introduced into the
   representation, thus overcoming the scope problem that the logical
   translations had.

[[62]edit] Notes

    1. [63]^ Emar Maier describes donkey pronouns as "bound but not
       [64]c-commanded" in a [65]Linguist List [66]review of Paul D.
       Elbourne's Situations and Individuals ([67]MIT Press, 2006).
    2. [68]^ Barker and Shan define a donkey pronoun as "a pronoun that
       lies outside the restrictor of a [69]quantifier or the
       [70]antecedent of a [71]conditional, yet [72]covaries with some
       [73]quantificational element inside it, usually an [74]indefinite."
       Chris Barker and Chung-chieh Shan, [75]'Donkey Anaphora is Simply
       Binding', colloquium presentation, Frankfurt, 2007.
    3. [76]^ Lewis describes this as his motivation for considering the
       issue in the introduction to Papers in Philosophical Logic, a
       collection of reprints of his articles. "There was no satisfactory
       way to assign relative scopes to quantifier phrases." ([77]CUP,
       1998: 2.)
