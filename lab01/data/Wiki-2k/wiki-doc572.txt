[[36]edit] In Rugrats

   Dil as seen in Rugrats

   When Dil joined the Rugrats cast in [37]1999, his age was moved up to 3
   months. From the very beginning, Dil had curly yet limited hair on his
   head, and he almost always wore yellow trap-door pajamas (though in the
   movies, his pajamas were purple). Because of his age, Dil could not say
   as many words as the other Rugrats. For the final five years of
   Rugrats' run, Dil had to learn on how to be a Rugrat. He always wanted
   everything at his age and would always do whatever he could to get
   anything. When he grabbed something, he would often say, "Mine!" (Which
   incidentally was his first word). He was just as selfish as his cousin
   Angelica, and always cried until something would get his attention.
   Dil's cuteness, however, saved Dil from becoming an Angelica-clone.
   When Didi was pregnant with Dil, she expected him to be a girl and she
   and Stu planned to name him "Trixie" after Stu's mother (Tommy also
   reveals that another name they had considered was "Delilah") but named
   him after Didi's cousin Dylan.^[38][3]

   Dil would always call Angelica "Yucky" (or "YAKEE", as he pronounced
   it), and he was also a hair puller. His favorite sports were [39]tennis
   (as evidenced in "Silent Angelica") and [40]baseball (as revealed in
   "Hand Me Downs"). Sometimes Dil would say "poopie" whenever he was
   about to poop on his diaper. And Dil would always be called up to save
   the other Rugrats at the right time (as when Dil found the treasure in
   "Club Fred"). Dil remained the same height until a [41]2003 episode
   titled "Back to School" when he, according to his father, [42]Stu
   Pickles, "grew an inch."

[[43]edit] In All Grown Up!

   At 9 years of age, Dil may still be the youngest of the gang, but he
   has come a long way from when he was a 3 month old. Dil now has red
   hair, like his mom Didi, and he has developed an unusual personality
   (caused by either being dropped on his head as a baby by Phil and Lil,
   or by his [44]DNA from his father Stu's side of the family, as
   evidenced in "Truth or Consequences" when Vice Principal Pangborn
   analyzed him). Dil had an imaginary best friend in Izzy in the episode
   "Izzy or Isn't He?". Dil has a pet goldfish called Pablo and in "Lucky
   13," Dil showed that he is fascinated by [45]dolphins, believing that
   they share 'a bond with our alien brethren' - possibly inspired by
   [46]Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. And in "The Big
   Score," Dil becomes the mascot for the middle school [47]soccer team by
   dressing up as various animals, including a slug and a monkey not
   unlike the [48]Los Angeles Angels' [49]Rally Monkey. Dil, in fact added
   soccer to the list of favorite sports early on in the series (since
   then however, most of the soccer is focused on [50]Phil and Lil
   DeVille). Dil is a team laser tag player, as shown in 'Tommy Foolery'.
   Dil also shows his side as an inventor in "Tweenage Tycoons," proving
   that Dil is a smart boy.

   Dil believes strongly in aliens and the supernatural, and he actually
   gets to interact with an extraterrestrial race in "Tommy Foolery". Dil
   also believes strongly in the theory of karma and has tried to train
   Angelica to build up her karmic residue to get rid of a zit on her
   cheek (It's Karma, Dude). Dil celebrates both Jewish and Christian
   holidays (Hanukkah and Christmas for example), this is due to his
   Father and Mother being Christian and Jewish, respectively. In fact, in
   the Christmas episode of [51]All Grown Up!, Dil and Tommy wrote a
   Hanukkah song and performed it after Susie sang the first verse of
   [52]The First Noel.

   Dil is not only an unusual boy; but he also is a mix of several
   international cultures. Thanks to his unusual behavior and originality,
   it's been thought that Dil was intended to be a [53]breakout character.
   This happened on the last seasons of the show which most of the
   story-lines included him and even in the last series episode "All Broke
   Up" he masterminded both plots. As a result, Dil was ranked number one
   in the most recent poll for favorite character.

[[54]edit] Multi-cultural practices

   Dil loves embracing different cultures. It is known that he wears a
   sherpa hat (as evidenced in "A DeVille House Divided") in almost every
   episode, and he wears the kilt part of Scottish culture and in the
   episode 'Memoirs Of A Finster', he was seen eating with chopsticks and
   wearing Japanese shoes and wearing a Mexican poncho. On 'Dude, Where's
   my Horse?', it is known that Dil is also interested in different
   languages like Spanish (which is the language of one of his favorite
   Soap Opera "Hospital de Tentacion!" ) and Portuguese as we saw in
   'Curse of Reptar'.

[[55]edit] Role as a little brother

   During the series Dil has changed his role of little brother, on Season
   1 and 2 we saw a continuity of how Dil looked up to Tommy, in All Grown
   Up he worshiped Tommy until Season 3 where Dil seems to get
   independence from his own brother, on Season 4 he finally breaks that
   feeling of worshiping and on Season 5 the rivalry of the brothers is
   more seen as Dil is totally independent from his brother, and as seen
   in Golden Boy he shows that he can be better than Tommy in almost
   everything, and defeating him in the forest with his skills that
   include: Talking to animals, constructing campers with things he can
   find in the forest etc.

[[56]edit] Gift of invention

   Like his father Stu before him, Dil Pickles possesses the gift of
   invention. However, Dil's inventions tend to be somewhat as weird as he
   is. "Tweenage Tycoons" featured many of these inventions:
     * The "BeltQuarium", a belt-like [57]aquarium that Dil built so he
       could keep an eye on his pet goldfish, Pablo.
     * "Shades With a View", shades that act somewhat like
       [58]Fisher-Price's [59]View-Master toy, with is a button on the top
       of the lens which allows the user to flip through different slides.
     * "Shillows", as Dil describes them, "shoes with pillows".
     * A tie with a watch face that allowed the wearer to quickly glance
       downwards and see the time, instead of lifting his hands to see the
       time.

   The episode "All Broke Up" also shows him inventing a board game called
   "Impatience."

   Also, another invention appeared briefly in "Truth or Consequences"
   that allowed Dil to read while walking backwards on his hands. As Dil
   passed by, it prompted [60]Phil to ask, "I wonder what Dil would be
   like if we never dropped him on his head?"

   Also in "Tweenage Tycoons", there were also several inventions and
   ideas that Dil considered during his inventor's block, that didn't turn
   out so well (some of which didn't even leave the drawing board!):
     * Talking socks
     * Blinking underwear
     * Mayonnaise Wallpaper
     * Ideas during his brief "normal" phase which had been done before
       like a [61]rubber band ball, a file cabinet, and [62]glue.

[[63]edit] Voice

   [64]Tara Strong was already a frequent Rugrats guest voice before
   officially joined the cast as the voice of Dil Pickles. Her most
   notable voice before being Dil was Timmy McNulty. Dil's Rugrats voice
   has been reused on another [65]cartoon, [66]The Proud Family, in which
   she is the voice of BeBe and CeCe Proud. In fact, until Rugrats ceased
   production Tara had recorded Dil's lines separately from other cast
   members, a job she did again as the voice of 3-month-old Dil for the
   video release "Tales from the Crib: Snow White," which was released on
   VHS and DVD on [67]September 26, [68]2005.

[[69]edit] National background

   Dil is a [70]Jewish Christian and a [71]Russian-American having
   [72]Jewish-Russian Grandparents (Boris and Minka) and an [73]American
   father (Stu) also being a [74]Christian. Dil's grandpa Lou's mother is
   [75]Scottish (as evidenced in All Grown Up! episode "Bad Blood").
