   Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic ( , Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panikku^[34]?, lit.
   "Dream Factory: Heart-Pounding Panic") is a [35]Japanese [36]video game
   released for the [37]Famicom Disk System about a family who plans to
   rescue two children. The game is best known for its Western conversion
   [38]Super Mario Bros. 2, which had its characters change to those from
   Nintendo's popular [39]Mario franchise. "Doki doki" is a Japanese
   [40]onomatopoeia for a rapidly beating heart, and it is commonly found
   in Japanese video game titles, carrying connotations of excitement and
   anxiety. Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic was one of the very few FDS Games to
   use the Famicom Sound Channel.^[[41]citation needed]

   The remade worldwide version of Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic, known as
   [42]Super Mario Bros. 2 (not to be confused with [43]Super Mario Bros.:
   The Lost Levels), was also released in Japan for the NES (rather than
   the Famicom Disk System), Super NES (as part of [44]Super Mario
   All-Stars), and Game Boy Advance (as part of [45]Super Mario Advance).
   In the Japanese Releases, it is known as Super Mario USA. The title
   screen in the version seen in Super Mario All-Stars is based on the
   Japanese NES version (red and black as opposed to red, white, and
   blue).

[[46]edit] Background

   Papa, Imajin, Lina, and Mama in the game's opening story.

   The game was developed in cooperation with [47]Fuji Television to
   promote its Yume Kj '87 (tr. Dream Factory '87) event, which showcased
   several of Fuji TV's latest TV shows and other products at the time.
   The game featured the mascots of the Yume Kj festival a family
   consisting of siblings Imajin and Lina and their parents, Papa and Mama
   as its main characters. The rest of the characters, including the main
   villain, Mamu ([48]Wart), were all creations by Nintendo for the game.
   The game takes place within a book with an [49]Arabian setting. All
   four characters are playable, and the game is not completed until the
   player plays through as all four. In the American localization Toad
   corresponds to the stout Papa, Princess Toadstool to floaty Lina,
   high-jumping Mama to Luigi and Imajin to Mario. Even though it was not
   originally conceived as a Mario game, [50]Shigeru Miyamoto had a larger
   involvement in this game than he did with the original [51]Super Mario
   Bros. 2 (known outside Japan as The Lost Levels) which was released in
   Japan. In [52]1988, the game was localized for [53]North America and
   [54]Europe as [55]Super Mario Bros. 2. The Yume Kj family members were
   replaced by [56]Mario, [57]Luigi, [58]Princess Toadstool, and [59]Toad,
   and numerous other small changes were made. Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic
   represents the original source of several elements that later became
   common in the [60]Mario series.
