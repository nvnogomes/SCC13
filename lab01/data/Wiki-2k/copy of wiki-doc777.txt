   Eastland Mall was a two-level, enclosed shopping mall located at 833
   East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Blvd in [21]North Versailles, Pennsylvania,
   situated on 57 acres (230,000 m^2) of land at the peak of a hill
   overlooking the [22]Monongahela River^[23][1]. The mall was home to
   such stores as [24]Gimbels, [25]Sears, [26]J.C. Penney, [27]F.W.
   Woolworth Company, and Gee Bee discount store^[28][1]. The mall annex
   also included a two screen movie theater and auto repair center.

[[33]edit] Opening

   The [34]Gimbels department store chain began construction on Eastland
   Mall in [35]1961. After approximately two years of construction and $12
   million of construction costs, Eastland Shopping Plaza opened on
   [36]August 15, [37]1963. In addition to a 200,000-square-foot
   (19,000 m^2) Gimbels, some of the nation's largest stores, [38]J.C.
   Penney, [39]Sears, [40]National Record Mart, [41]May-Stern, [42]Kinney
   Shoes, [43]Thom McAn, and [44]F.W. Woolworth Company moved into the
   mall.

   When Eastland Shopping Plaza opened, downtown [45]McKeesport (the
   largest retailer in the Mon-Valley at the time) suffered as Sears and
   J.C. Penney moved from McKeesport into Eastland Shopping Plaza. Three
   other McKeesport retailers, Immel's, Wander Sales, and Richard's Shoes,
   opened stores in Eastland. At its peak in the 1960s, Eastland Shopping
   Plaza employed 800 people.^[46][1]

[[47]edit] Decline

   Local residents say that the mall was doomed from the start. While
   Gimbels was being built, high winds blew down its unfinished brick
   walls.

   The upper level of Eastland was originally an open-air marketplace.
   After a fire destroyed much of the property and caused $1 million worth
   of damage on [48]June 6, [49]1973, a roof was added and the entire mall
   was enclosed. At this time the "Shopping Plaza" in Eastland's name was
   changed to "Mall" and a Gee Bee discount store was opened.

   Just six years after its opening Eastland faced competition from
   all-enclosed [50]Monroeville Mall, then billed as the largest mall in
   the United States, located under six miles (10 km) away. Four years
   earlier, Eastland saw competition from [51]South Hills Village, the
   country's largest (and first two-story) enclosed mall, in [52]Upper St.
   Clair and [53]Bethel Park. In [54]1979, [55]Century III Mall, the third
   largest enclosed shopping center in the world (at that time), opened
   10 miles (16 km) away in [56]West Mifflin to further speed the decline
   of Eastland as J.C. Penney relocated from Eastland Mall to Century III
   Mall.

   Furthermore, whereas these three malls were located in and around more
   affluent suburbs, Eastland was located primarily around old mill towns.
   Many of these communities lost vast amounts of population during the
   lifetime of the Eastland Mall. [57]Braddock, which East
   Pittsburgh-McKeesport Blvd leads directly into two miles (3 km) away,
   had approximately 12,000 residents in 1963. By the mall's close in 2005
   it had fewer than 3,000. This demographic change took with it potential
   customers and employees of Eastland Mall.

   After Eastland Mall had already filed for [58]Chapter 11 bankruptcy,
   its most devastating blow came in [59]September 1986 when [60]Gimbels,
   which had developed and owned the mall, went out of business, taking
   most of Eastland's tenants along with it. Benderson Development Company
   of [61]Buffalo, NY purchased the mall from the bankrupt Gimbels
   department store two years later.^[62][1]

   For the next 20 years Eastland tried to stay afloat with a variety of
   unique tenants - including a [63]PennDOT state driver's license testing
   center, a beer distributor (Beer World, located in the old J.C.
   Penney's), a distribution center for [64]Xerox, the local magistrate's
   office, a professional wrestling center (PWX, owned by James Miller), a
   bingo parlor (Eastland Social Hall Bingo), and a low power TV station,
   [65]WBYD-CA. Most notable was the addition of a two story indoor and
   spacious outdoor [66]flea market in the space once occupied by Gimbels
   which, according to a flea market manager, drew 500 vendors and 2,000
   customers per weekend at its peak^[67][2].
   The Eastland Flea Market

   Many smaller retail stores then opened inside the mall, including
   Harper's Bazaar (a [68]mom-and-pop women's clothing store run by Jim
   and Carol Harper), Kennywood Messenger Service (a notary and vehicle
   licensing service), Amer-a-Quick printing service, a barber shop, and a
   beauty parlor. The revival was temporary. In the 1990s, the flea market
   was moved off to the side in the old Gee Bee store, taking foot traffic
   away from the retail stores located inside the mall.

   The building then fell into a state of ruin. By the time the mall
   closed in 2005, it was only worth $1.38 million - less than the $1.4
   million that Benderson Development Company paid for it 1988. By that
   point, trash cans holding water falling from the leaky roof abounded
   throughout the mall. Parts of the original Gimbels facade had collapsed
   and the walls were showing stress cracks. The walkway was no longer
   heated and the tiles were so broken and floor so uneven the heels of a
   shopper's shoes often caught in the floor.^[69][1]

   Two tenants survived for the entire 42-year life of the mall, Valley
   Shoe Repair and Marc Anthony's Hair Salon.

   Although some tenants supported keeping the mall open, [70]North
   Versailles Township officials wanted to see the property cleared and
   replaced by new retail space or housing. It was also rumored that
   [71]University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) purchased the
   property in order to centralize their Braddock and McKeesport hospital
   locations. After a year of sitting vacant, the mall, including the
   theater, was razed in early 2007. Benderson Development, the company
   who owns the Eastland property plans to build a multi use complex on
   the site known as "Eastland Centre". Benderson bills Eastland Centre as
   a Retail/Office/Warehouse/Distribution complex. Only 10 miles (16 km)
   from downtown Pittsburgh, the centre is strategically located near a
   major population area, yet is situated in an area which is easy to
   access throughout the region. Eastland's proximity to major interstate
   highways make it a prime location for a warehouse/distribution
   center.^[72][3]
