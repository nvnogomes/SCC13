   Edward "Ted" Stickles (born [11]April 7, [12]1942 in [13]San Francisco,

   1995. He was inducted into the Indiana University Hall of Fame in 1998.

   Stickles swam with [16]Doc Councilman's [17]Indiana University swim

   roommate, Hall of Famer [18]Chet Jastremski, held a total of seven
   world records. Ted broke a total of nine world records in the

   Olympic team. They would have been the first brother and sister to make
   an Olympic team.
