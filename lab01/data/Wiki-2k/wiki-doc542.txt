   Durrn ([15]Persian: ) or Abdl ([16]Persian: ) is the name of a chief
   [17]tribal [18]confederation in [19]Afghanistan and [20]Pakistan.
   Originally known by their ancient name Abdalite, they have been called
   Durrani since the beginning of the [21]Durrani Empire in 1747.^[22][1]
   The number of Durranis are estimated to be roughly 16% of the
   population of [23]Afghanistan or 5 million individuals.^[24][2] They
   are also found in large numbers in western Pakistan. The Durrani
   Pashtuns are trilingual in [25]Pashto, [26]Dari and [27]Urdu, and are
   arguably the most urbanized and educated of the [28]Pashtun tribes in
   Afghanistan.

   The Durranis have been prominent leaders, as the royal family of
   Afghanistan is derived from the tribe, and a substantial number of
   Durrani Pashtuns are [29]bureaucrats and public [30]officials, as well
   as businessmen and merchants. The particular dialect of [31]Pashto
   language favored by the Durrani Pashtuns tends to be tinged with a
   slight Persian inflection and is considered the more genteel and urbane
   dialect, often viewed by Pashtuns overall as the more 'proper' dialect,
   as opposed to the rougher [32]"Pukhtu" version favored in the north and
   by most of the Pashtuns of Pakistan. The Durranis, like most other
   Pashtuns, were [33]Zoroastrians, who later on accepted Islam and are
   now [34]Muslims of the [35]Hanafi [36]Sunni [37]Islamic sect and
   continue to follow the Pashtun honor code known as [38]Pashtunwali.
   Most of the Hindu Durranis migrated to India after partition of India
   in 1947. Durranis of Hindu origin are prominent members of Khatri Clan
   which incidently lived in areas now known as Afghanistan, Uzbekistan,
   Potohar plateau of Punjab, Pakistan, Multan, Sindh provience of
   Pakistan etc

[[44]edit] A brief history

   The Durranis are, like other Pashtuns and neighbouring peoples,
   [45]Iranian-speaking. The Durranis were known in the past as "Abdalis,"
   from approximately the 7th century until about 1750, shortly after the
   [46]Durrani Empire was established at [47]Kandahar. The Abdalis appear
   to have begun to spread out during the early [48]Middle Ages along with
   other Pashtun tribes and came to inhabit much of what is today
   Afghanistan and Pakistan. One of the most prominent generals of the
   Persian empire, was a young Pashtun Abdali chieftain named [49]Ahmad
   Shah Abdali.

   The name or title Durrani or 'Durr-i-Durran' means the '[50]pearl of
   pearls' in Persian. It was carried by the Abdali tribe in 1747 when
   Ahmad Shah Abdali (born in [51]Multan, Pakistan) united the Pashtun
   tribes following a [52]loya jirga and changed his own name to [53]Ahmad
   Shah Durrani after becoming [54]Emir of Afghanistan or Emir of the
   [55]Durrani Empire. Since this period, the kings of Afghanistan have
   been of Durrani extraction. The Durranis were the most divided Pashtun
   tribe during the rule of the [56]Ghilzai-dominated [57]Taliban, with
   some having openly opposed them. The Durrani are the politically
   dominant Pashtun group in Afghanistan as the current [58]President of
   Afghanistan, [59]Hamid Karzai, is of the Durrani sub-group known as the
   [60]Popalzai and has close ties to the former king of Afghanistan
   [61]Zahir Shah, another member of the Durrani tribe.

[[62]edit] Branches, clans, subtribes

   The Durrani tribe is divided into two branches [63]Panjpai and
   [64]Zirak. Durrani tribes of the [65]Zirak branch include [66]Popalzai,
   the [67]Alikozai, the [68]Barakzai, and the [69]Achakzai.

   The [70]Panjpai branch are today mainly found west of Kandahar in
   [71]Helmand and [72]Farah, and include the [73]Noorzai, the [74]Alizai,
   the [75]Eshaqzai or [76]Sakzai, Khokani, and Maku.

   The literacy rate of the Durrani is the highest of all of the Pashtun
   tribes in Afghanistan and hovers around 25%. The Durrani are considered
   the most liberal of the Pashtun tribes. The Durrani continue to live in
   close proximity to other [77]people of Afghanistan and culturally
   overlap in many ways with the [78]Tajiks with whom they often share
   more cultural and socio-economic traits in comparison to the more
   tribal Pashtuns such as the [79]Ghilzai, who are the other major
   Pashtun tribe in Afghanistan. The Durrani are part of [80]Sarbans, a
   Pashtun tribal group.
