   Colombia-Ecuador relations refers to the [15]diplomatic relations
   between the neighboring [16]Republic of Colombia and the [17]Republic
   of Ecuador. The present territory of both countries was under the
   [18]Spanish empire during the [19]Spanish colonization of the Americas.
   After the [20]wars for independence against the Spanish empire led by
   [21]Simon Bolivar, Ecuador, Colombia (then called [22]Nueva Granada),
   and [23]Venezuela became part of the [24]Gran Colombia confederation.
   Gran Colombia struggled to hold together as a country. After intense
   civil conflicts between political factions led to a separation and
   territorial divisions and changes.

[[32]edit] Diplomatic relations

   Present-day Colombia and Ecuador trace back established official
   diplomatic relations to December, 1831 with the signing of the
   [33]Treaty of Pasto, in which both countries recognized each other as
   sovereign states. The Ecuadorean diplomatic mission in New Granada
   (Colombia) did not open until 1837. It wasn't until 1939 that Ecuador
   raised the diplomatic mission's status to an official Embassy. Colombia
   did the same the following year in 1940.^[34][1]

[[35]edit] Andean diplomatic crisis (2008)

          Main article: [36]2008 Andean diplomatic crisis

   On [37]March 1, [38]2008 the Colombian military launched an attack
   against [39]FARC in the border area between Colombia and Ecuador, which
   ended with the death of some 19 guerrillas including the group's second
   in command [40]Raul Reyes and one Colombian soldier. The attack
   targeted a guerrilla camp some 1.8 km inside Ecuadorean territory.

   Colombian president [41]lvaro Uribe called the Ecuadorean president
   [42]Rafael Correa, arguing that Colombian forces had crossed the border
   during combat in pursuit of the guerrillas. Correa said he would
   investigate the events and later accused the Colombian president of
   being either misinformed or lying to him. The accusation was based on
   the information provided by the Ecuadorean army in the bombed area,
   describing what Correa later called a "massacre". According to the
   Ecuadorean president, bodies in their underwear or pajamas were found
   in the guerrilla camp, indicating that they would have been sleeping at
   the time of the bomb raid and that there was no "hot pursuit" as
   president Uribe had informed him hours earlier. The Ecuadorean
   president decided then to recall his ambassador in [43]Bogot for
   consultations. The Colombian government subsequently apologized for its
   actions while accusing the Ecuadorean government of giving safe conduct
   to the FARC.

   Reacting to the event, President of Venezuela, Hugo Chvez stated that
   if Colombia launched a similar operation within Venezuelan borders he
   would consider it a [44]casus belli and verbally attacked the Colombian
   president. Chvez ordered ten Venezuelan national guard battalions to
   the Colombia-Venezuela border and closed its embassy in Bogot. Chvez
   also offered his support to Ecuadorean president Correa.

[[45]edit] Purported plans to destabilize Colombia

   In a press conference held on March 3, 2008 the [46]Colombian National
   Police chief [47]Oscar Naranjo claimed that their intelligence service
   had confiscated three computers from [48]Ral Reyes with extensive
   information purportedly detailing a close relationship between the FARC
   and the governments of Hugo Chvez and Rafael Correa. The police chief
   stated that these documents proved that the Ecuadorean government
   agreed with Reyes to provide safe conduct for him in Ecuadorean
   territory. He also accused Venezuela of having plans to destabilize the
   Colombian government and a plan to provide [49]uranium to the FARC and
   produce a [50]dirty bomb.

   These claims are denied by the Ecuadorian government sustaining that
   the little contact they had with FARC was well known by the Colombian
   government, and it was for humanitarian purposes only. In a visit to
   Brazil, Correa made a comparisson by pointing out that president of
   France, Sarkozy is also in contact with FARC, and yet nobody would even
   think to accuse him of such things. Venezuela rejected the accusations
   by sarcasticly saying that from these computers would come out every
   document the Colombian government decides they need.

[[51]edit] Suspension of diplomatic relations

   As a response to the crisis the Ecuadorean government of Rafael Correa
   decided to end any diplomatic relations with Colombia, ordered the
   Ecuadorean embassy in Colombia to close and expelled the Colombian
   ambassador.

   The [52]Ecuadorian and [53]Colombian presidents [54]Rafael Correa and
   [55]lvaro Uribe agreed to restore low-level [56]diplomatic relations at
   the level of [57]Charg d'Affaires immediately and without preconditions
   on [58]June 6, [59]2008 following individual communications with and
   under a deal brokered by former U.S. President [60]Jimmy
   Carter.^[61][2]^[62][3]
