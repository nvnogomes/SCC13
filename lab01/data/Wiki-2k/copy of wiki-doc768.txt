   The [14]West/[15]Central [16]Canadian English dialect is one of the
   largest and most homogeneous [17]dialect areas in [18]North America,
   ranging from [19]Ontario, through the [20]Prairie Provinces to
   [21]British Columbia. It forms a dialect continuum with the accent in
   the [22]Western [23]United States, and borders the [24]Canadian North,
   and U.S. [25]North Central and [26]Inland North dialect regions. While
   it is one of the most homogeneous in that the regional differences
   inside the dialect area are very small, it has few unique features. It
   is very similar to [27]General American English.

   While the West/Central dialect is mutually intelligible with many
   dialects of English spoken in England, especially Received
   Pronunciation, in general it preserves more archaic features, that
   existed before the dialects split.
     * Unlike RP, the West/Central dialect is [80]rhotic. This means it
       maintains the pronunciation of r before consonants. Rhoticity has
       been largely influenced by [81]Hiberno-English, [82]Scottish
       English, and [83]West Country English. The sound corresponding to
       the letter "R" is a [84]retroflex or [85]alveolar [86]approximant
       rather than a trill or a tap. The 'er' sound of (stressed) fur or
       (unstressed) butter, which is represented in [87]IPA as stressed []
       or unstressed [] is realized in Canadian English as a
       [88]monophthongal [89]r-colored vowel.
     * It has also not shifted [] to [] (the so-called "broad A") before
       [f], [s], [], [], [z], [v] alone or preceded by [n].

   Both RP, and the West/Central dialect have gone through the following
   changes:
     * The [90]horse-hoarse merger of the vowels [] and [o] before 'r',
       making pairs like horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four,
       morning/mourning etc. [91]homophones.
     * The [92]wine-whine merger making pairs like wine/whine, wet/whet,
       Wales/whales, wear/where etc. [93]homophones, in most cases
       eliminating //, the [94]voiceless labiovelar fricative. This is
       preserved in some older speakers, as well as being an archaicism.

   The following changes are innovations, and do not occur in RP. It
   shares these changes with General American.
     * The [95]merger of [] and [], making father and bother rhyme.
     * The replacement of the lot vowel with the strut vowel in most
       utterances of the words was, of, from, what, everybody, nobody,
       somebody, anybody, and because.
     * [96]Vowel merger before intervocalic /r/.
     * The merger of [] and [] after [97]palatals in some words, so that
       cure, pure, mature and sure rhyme with fir in some speech registers
       for some speakers.
     * Some speakers have [98]Dropping of [j] after [99]alveolar
       consonants so that new, duke, Tuesday, suit, resume, lute are
       pronounced /nu/, /duk/, /tuzde/, /sut/, /zum/, /lut/.
     * Both intervocalic /nt/ and /n/ may be realized as [n] or [], making
       winter and winner homophones for some speakers. This does not occur
       when the second syllable is stressed, as in entail.
     * Laxing of /e/, /i/ and /u/ to //, // and // before //, causing
       pronunciations like [p], [p] and [pj] for pair, peer and pure for
       some speakers.
     * The [100]flapping of intervocalic /t/ and /d/ to [101]alveolar tap
       [] before reduced vowels. The words ladder and latter are mostly or
       entirely homophonous, possibly distinguished only by the length of
       preceding vowel. For some speakers, the merger is incomplete and
       't' before a reduced vowel is sometimes not tapped following [e] or
       [] when it represents [102]underlying 't'; thus greater and grader,
       and unbitten and unbidden are distinguished.
     * The vowels in words such as [103]Mary, marry, merry are [104]merged
       to the [105]open-mid front unrounded vowel [], except in Quebec.

   The following changes are shared with the Western dialect in the US:
     * Traditionally [106]diphthongal [107]vowels such as [o] as in boat
       and [e], as in bait, have acquired qualities much closer to
       [108]monophthongs in some speakers. However, the continuing
       presence of slight offglides (if less salient than those of, say,
       British [109]Received Pronunciation) and convention in [110]IPA
       [111]transcription for English account for continuing use of [o]
       and [e].
     * The [112]cot-caught merger exists. A notable exception occurs with
       some speakers over the age of 60, especially in rural areas in the
       Prairies, although the merger is the most widespread overall.
     * For most speakers, // is realized as [e] before g.
     * The words origin, Florida, horrible, quarrel, warren, are all
       generally realized as [-r-], rather than [-r-].
     * /u/ is slightly fronted after [113]coronals.
     * The /i/ ending in words of more than two syllables is realized as
       [in], [n], or [].
     * Milk is realized as [mlk] by some speakers, [mlk] by others,
       although words such as pillow are pronounced with [-l-].

   The following changes are shared with the Western dialect in the U.S.,
   but to a lesser extent:

   The [114]Canadian Shift: The vowels in the words cot and caught merge
   to []. The // of bat is retracted to [a] (except before nasals):
   indeed, // is lower in this variety than almost all other North
   American dialects;^[115][1] the retraction of // was independently
   observed in [116]Vancouver^[117][2] and is more advanced for Ontarians
   and women than for people from the [118]Prairies or [119]Atlantic
   Canada and men.^[120][3] Then, // and // are lowered in the direction
   of [] and [] and/or retracted; studies actually disagree on the
   trajectory of the shift.^[121][4]

   The following changes are shared with the [122]Pacific Northwest
   English dialect, as well as other dialects:
     * [123]-tensing // is tense before velar stops. This can cause words
       such as "bag" and "beg" to sound very similar, and some speakers
       pronounce both as [beg]. Some speakers, especially in Ontario have
       tense -tensing before nasals as well.
     * Tomorrow is generally pronounced as [-r-], instead of [-r-].
     * The following feature is most prominent in the Prairies, Ontario,
       and the Maritimes: "[124]Canadian raising": [125]diphthongs are
       "raised" before [126]voiceless [127]consonants (e.g., [p], [t],
       [k], [s], [f]). For example, [128]IPA /a/ (the vowel of "eye") and
       /a/ (the vowel of "loud") become [] and [], respectively, the /a/
       component of the [129]diphthong going from a low vowel to a
       [130]mid vowel ([]). Note also that this phenomenon preserves the
       recoverability of the phoneme /t/ in "writer" despite the North
       American English process of flapping, which merges /t/ and /d/ into
       [] before unstressed vowels, so "writer" and "rider" can be
       distinguished from each other even though the t and d in those
       words are pronounced the same. The most noticeable feature is the
       raising of /a/ to [] because [] is an [131]allophone of /o/ (as in
       "road") in many other dialects, so the (mainly Eastern) Canadian
       pronunciation of "about the house" may sound like *"a boat the
       hoas" to speakers of dialects without the raising, and in many
       cases is misheard or exaggerated to "aboot the hoose". Some
       [132]stand-up and [133]situation [134]comedians, as well as
       television shows actually do exaggerate the pronunciation to
       *"aboot the hoos" for comic effect, for example in the
       [135]American [136]television series [137]South Park. However, as
       it is untrue, this exaggeration can be considered offensive by some
       Canadians.

   In contrast to General American:
     * The // of foreign loan words in words such as drama or Iraq are
       usually pronounced like the a in bat: [dm], [k].
     * Been is usually pronounced /bin/ rather than /bn/.
     * Words such as borrow, sorry, and sorrow are generally pronounced
       with [-r-], instead of with [-r-].
     * Americans sometimes claim to be able to recognize the
       Western/Central Canadian dialect instantly by their use of the word
       [138]eh. However, only a certain usage of eh (detailed in the
       article) is peculiar to Canada. It is common in southern
       [139]Ontario, the [140]Maritimes and the [141]Prairie provinces. eh
       is used quite frequently in the North Central dialect, so a
       Canadian accent is often detected in people from [142]North Dakota,
       [143]Michigan, [144]Minnesota, and [145]Wisconsin.
     * [146]Canadian raising

[[147]edit] Regional Variation

[[148]edit] British Columbia

          See also: [149]Pacific Northwest English

   The dialect is very similar to the English spoken in the Prairies and
   Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. BC is home to a very diverse population.
   In parts of the Fraser Valley the intonation and cadence of Dutch and
   Mennonite German have influenced local English. British accents and a
   wide range of European and Asian second-language flavoured English have
   always been common, to the point of the British flavour being
   identifiably a hallmark of early 20th Century British Columbia, as has
   been English as spoken by First Nations peoples, which is distinct as
   an accent but also remains largely undocumented. Unlike in the
   prairies, [150]Canadian raising (one of the most noticeable features of
   Canadian English), found in words such as "about" and "writer" is
   receding in BC, and many speakers do not raise /a/ before voiceless
   consonants. Younger speakers in the Greater Vancouver area do not even
   raise /a/, causing "about" to sound like "abowt". The "o" in such words
   as "holy," "goal," "load," "know," etc. is pronounced as a back and
   rounded [o], but not as rounded as in the Prairies where there is a
   strong Scandinavian, Slavic and German influence. The interrogative
   "eh" is not used as frequently as in the rest of Canada.

[[152]edit] Chinook Jargon

          Main article: [153]Chinook Jargon use by English Language
          speakers

   [154]Pacific Northwest English and [155]British Columbian English have
   several words still in current use which are loanwords from the
   [156]Chinook Jargon, which was widely spoken throughout [157]British
   Columbia by all ethnicities well into the middle of the 20th Century.
   [158]Skookum, [159]potlatch, muckamuck, saltchuck, and other Chinook
   Jargon words are widely used by people who do not speak Chinook Jargon.
   These words tend to be shared with, but are not as common in, the
   states of [160]Oregon, [161]Washington, [162]Alaska and, to a lesser
   degree, [163]Idaho and western [164]Montana.

[[165]edit] Prairies

   A strong [166]Canadian raising exists in the [167]prairie regions
   together with certain older usages such as chesterfield and front room
   also associated with the Maritimes. Aboriginal Canadians are a larger
   and more conspicuous population in prairie cities than elsewhere in the
   country and certain elements of aboriginal speech in English are
   sometimes to be heard. Similarly, the linguistic legacy, mostly
   intonation but also speech patterns and syntax, of the Scandinavian,
   Slavic and German settlers  who are far more numerous and historically
   important in the Prairies than in Ontario or the Maritimes  can be
   heard in the general milieu. Again, the large [168]Mtis population in
   Saskatchewan also carries with it certain linguistic traits inherited
   from French, aboriginal and Celtic forebears.

   The noun bluff (and the adjective bluffy) in reference to an aspen and
   willow grove typically surrounding a slough, appears to be unknown
   outside the Canadian prairies, whereas the eastern Canadian and
   international use of the term in reference to a low cliff or abutment,
   is largely unknown in western Canada and causes some puzzlement to
   newly arrived westerners in Ontario.

   The phrase whack of is often used in western Canada to refer to a large
   amount, e.g., We sure got a whole whack of snow in town last week!.

   Prairie housewives formerly used the somewhat disparaging adjective
   boughten, also used in the Northern U.S., in reference to bread
   purchased commercially rather than home-baked. The word is now
   considered nonstandard, and rarely used.

   In [169]Saskatchewan, the term "bunny hug" refers to a [170]hooded
   sweatshirt.

   There is noticeable pronunciation differences by which each speaker
   calls the name of his or her respective city. People from [171]Edmonton
   generally omit the "d" in their city's name, making it sound more like
   "Eh-mon-ten". [172]Calgary is pronounced by people native to the city
   as with an [] or an [], or omit the second "a" altogether, making the
   name sound like "Cal-guh-ry" or simply "Cal-g-ry", instead of
   "Cal-gah-ry", used elsewhere in the country. [173]Saskatoon is
   pronounced as "Sask-toon" by its native residents, omitting the "a".
   People from [174]Regina (pronounced generally as [/rdan/]) are inclined
   to pronounce the first vowel as an [] instead of an []. People from
   cities with longer names tend to shorten their city's name to a single
   syllable, as in the case of [175]Lloydminster (Lloyd), [176]Swift
   Current (Swift), [177]Medicine Hat (Med), Lethbridge (Leth) etc. With
   regards to provincial names, Albertans tend to lessen the emphasis on
   the "al" in Alberta, making the province's name sound like "ul-ber-ta".
   Saskatchewan residents pronounce the "wan" as [/wn/] instead of [/wn/],
   which is used elsewhere in Canada.

   Other prairie terms include:

   [178]Slough: a shallow pond that is located in a field that usually
   dries up in the summer.
   Dugout: a small, artificial (or artificially-deepened) body of water,
   often dug to provide soil for road construction.

   Mostly used in Alberta due to its climate, a [179]Chinook refers to a
   warm winter wind that causes sudden increase in temperature (20-30
   degrees in a matter of an hour or two)

   [180]Shinny: A form of [181]ice hockey played without skates.

   A semi or semi-truck is a large trailer used for the transportation of
   mostly industrial goods.

   May Long is a regionalism to refer to the [182]long weekend for
   [183]Victoria Day every May.

   [184]Chauch: A slang term generally referring to young men who work out
   and attempt to dress well but are ultimately, not classy. (In 1970s
   Ontario, "chauch" meant attractive young women, normally heard in the
   expression "Nice chauch". The word was both singular and plural.)

   header, gooder, giver (mostly Saskatchewan and southern and eastern
   Manitoba, although this is also used in parts of the United States): As
   in, to leave, it was great, give it all (or alternatively, to leave),
   respectively.

   [185]Listen to a sample of Prairies English

[[186]edit] Ontario

   [187]Canadian raising is often quite strong in [188]Ontario.

[[189]edit] Midwestern Ontario

   The subregion of [190]Midwestern Ontario consists of the Counties of
   [191]Huron, [192]Bruce County, [193]Bruce, [194]Grey, and [195]Perth.
   The "Queen's Bush" as the area was called, did not experience
   communication with Southwestern and Central dialects until the early
   20th century. Thus, a strong accent similar to Central Ontarian is
   heard, yet many different phrasings exist. It is typical in the area to
   drop phonetic sounds to make shorter contractions, such as: Prolly
   (Probably), Goin' (Going), and "Wuts goin' on tonight? D'ya wanna do
   sumthin'?" It is particularly strong in the County of Bruce, so much
   that it is commonly referred to as being the Bruce Cownian (Bruce
   Countian) accent. Also 'er' sounds are often pronounced 'air', with
   "were" sounding more like "wear".

[[196]edit] Ottawa Valley

   The [197]Ottawa Valley has its own distinct accent, known as the
   [198]Ottawa Valley Twang.

[[199]edit] Eastern Ontario

   [200]Canadian raising is not as strong in [201]Eastern Ontario as it is
   in the rest of the province. In [202]Prescott and Russell, parts of
   [203]Stormont-Dundas-Glengarry and Eastern [204]Ottawa, [205]French
   accents are often mixed with English ones due to the high
   [206]Franco-Ontarian population there. In [207]Renfrew County a
   separate dialect known as [208]Ottawa Valley Twang has developed. In
   [209]Lanark County, Western [210]Ottawa and [211]Leeds-Grenville and
   the rest of [212]Stormont-Dundas-Glengarry, the accent spoken is nearly
   identical to that spoken in [213]Central Ontario and the [214]Quinte
   area.

   Words in which the Eastern Ontario accent is significant:
     * Got it - often pronounced [g]
     * Okay - often pronounced [ke]
     * Hello - often pronounced [helo]

[[215]edit] Toronto

   Suburban residents are known to ignore the second T, pronouncing it as
   "To-RAW-no", "T'Ronno" or even "Tronna" or "Tron-o" and Bloor Street as
   "Bluer Street". Suburban residents describe east and west as the "East
   End" or the "West End". Natives from the city core describe east and
   west as the "East side" or "East end" and the "West Side" or "West
   end". Other streets in Toronto have distinct differences between their
   spelling and pronuciation: notably, "Eglinton" would be said
   "Eglington" by most Torontonians.^[216][5]

   In Toronto and the areas surrounding Toronto (Central Ontario,
   [217]Greater Toronto Area), the [] is often pronounced as [d].
   Sometimes (particularly in [218]North York, an area of Toronto), [] is
   elided altogether, resulting in "Do you want this one er'iss one?" The
   word southern is often pronounced with [a]. In the regional area north
   of York and south of Parry Sound, notably among those who were born in
   these bedroom communities (Barrie, Vaughan, Orillia, Bradford,
   Newmarket) as opposed to those who moved there to commute, the cutting
   down of syllables is often heard, e.g. "probably" is reduced to
   "prolly", or "probly" when used as a response.

   Slang terms used in Toronto are synonymous with those used in other
   major North American cities. There is also a heavy influx of slang
   terminology originating from Toronto's many immigrant communities, of
   which the vast majority speak English only as a second or minor
   language. These terms originate mainly from various European, Asian,
   and African words. Many suburban Torontonians use buddy (without a
   capital) as it is often used in Newfoundland English as equivalent to
   that man ("I like buddy's car").

   In Toronto's ethnic communities there are many words that are distinct;
   many of which come from the city's large [219]Caribbean community.

[[220]edit] Southwestern Ontario

   Southwestern Ontario English mainly consists of a mix of Toronto
   English, and Midwestern Ontario English. It has an accent very similar
   of a mix between Toronto English, and Midwestern Ontario English,
   although recently, some words have been taken from Southern English
   English, especially around [221]London, Ontario.

   [222]Listen to a sample of Ontario English

[[223]edit] Quebec

          Main article: [224]Quebec English

   English is a minority language in Quebec, but has many speakers in
   Montral, the [225]Eastern Townships and in the
   [226]Gatineau-[227]Ottawa region. Among Montral-native anglophones,
   there is a distinction between // and /a/, unique in Canada, so that
   Mary and merry are not homophones. Among Eastern Townships-native
   anglophones, syrup is often pronounced as sir-rup. Quebec also has
   French influence. A person with English mother tongue and still
   speaking English as the first language is called an Anglophone. The
   corresponding term for a French speaker is Francophone and the
   corresponding term for a person who is neither Anglophone nor
   Francophone is Allophone. Quebec Anglophones generally pronounce French
   street names in Montreal as French words. Pie IX Boulevard is
   pronounced as in French, not as "pie nine", but as "pee-nuff". On the
   other hand, Anglophones do pronounce final d's as in Bernard and
   Bouchard; the word Montreal is pronounced as an English word and Rue
   Lambert-Closse is known as Clossy Street.
