Edward Earl Johnson

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edward Earl Johnson (1961 [8]May 20, [9]1987) was a convicted
   [10]murderer [11]executed by the [12]U.S. state of [13]Mississippi. He
   was convicted of the murder of a policeman, J.T. Trest and the
   [14]sexual assault of a 69-year-old woman, Sally Franklin. Throughout
   his eight years on [15]death row he continued to plead his innocence.

[[16]edit] Case

   His case came to international attention when he was featured in the
   [17]BBC documentary [18]Fourteen Days In May. Broadcast in 1987, the
   documentary showed the last two weeks of Johnson's life. It starts on
   May 6, the day that Johnson learns the date of his [19]execution. In
   interviews he says that his confession was made under [20]duress with
   police threatening him with death.

   The book, Life on Death Row (Thomas, 1991) details the events leading
   up to and following the Johnson trial. Thomas shows the key witness for
   the prosecution to be unreliable, changing her story and identification
   of her assailant several times at the time of the event and in
   subsequent questioning.

[[21]edit] Execution

   In spite of [22]British lawyer [23]Clive Stafford Smith's attempts for
   a reprieve, Edward was executed (the documentary team were given access
   to him until minutes before the sentence was carried out). A follow up
   documentary by Stafford Smith claimed to prove conclusively that
   Johnson was innocent and had been framed.

   He was pronounced dead at 12:06 a.m. on [24]May 20, [25]1987 after
   being put to death in the [26]gas chamber of what was then called
   [27]Parchman Prison Farm.

   It was the second execution by the state of Mississippi since the
   [28]Gregg v. Georgia decision and the 72nd overall in the United
   States.
