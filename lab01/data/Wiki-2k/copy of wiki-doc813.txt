   Walden (first published as Walden; or, Life in the Woods) by [65]Henry
   David Thoreau is one of the best-known [66]non-fiction books written by
   an [67]American. Published in 1854, it details Thoreau's sojourn in a
   cabin near [68]Walden Pond, amidst woodland owned by his friend and
   mentor [69]Ralph Waldo Emerson, near [70]Concord, Massachusetts.
   However, Emerson's lack of enthusiasm for the project can be seen in
   this thought delivered during Thoreau's funeral: "I so much regret the
   loss of his rare powers of action, that I cannot help counting it a
   fault in him that he had no ambition. Wanting this [that is, lacking
   ambition] instead of engineering for all America, he was the captain of
   a [71]huckleberry party. Pounding beans is good to the end of pounding
   empires one of these days; but if, at the end of years, it is still
   only beans!" Thoreau did not intend to live as a [72]hermit, for he
   received visitors and returned their visits. Instead, he hoped to
   isolate himself from society in order to gain a more objective
   understanding of it. [73]Simple living and [74]self-sufficiency were
   Thoreau's other goals, and the whole project was inspired by
   [75]transcendentalist philosophy, which was one of the key ideas of the
   American Romantic Period. As Thoreau made clear in his book, his cabin
   was not in wilderness but at the edge of town, not far from his family
   home.

[[82]edit] Synopsis

   Economy: This is the first chapter and also the longest by far. Thoreau
   begins by outlining his project: a two-year and two-month stay at a
   crude cabin in the woods near Walden Pond. He does this, he says, in
   order to illustrate the spiritual benefits of a simplified lifestyle.
   He easily supplies the four necessities of life (food, shelter,
   clothing, and fuel). He meticulously records his expenditures and
   earnings, demonstrating his understanding of "economy," as he builds
   his house and buys and grows food. For a home and freedom, he spends a
   mere $28.13.

   Complementary Verses: This chapter consists entirely of a poem, "The
   Pretensions of Poverty," by seventeenth-century English poet [83]Thomas
   Carew. The poem criticizes those who think that their poverty gives
   them unearned moral and intellectual superiority.

   Where I Lived, and What I Lived For: After playing with the idea of
   buying a farm, Thoreau describes his cabin's location. Then he explains
   that he took up his abode at Walden Woods so as to "live deliberately,
   to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn
   what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had
   not lived."

   Reading: Thoreau provides discourse on the benefits of reading
   [84]classical literature (preferably in the original [85]Greek or
   [86]Latin) and bemoans the lack of sophistication in Concord,
   manifested in the popularity of popular literature. He yearns for a
   [87]utopian time when each New England village will support "wise men"
   to educate and thereby ennoble the population.

   Sounds: Thoreau opens this chapter by warning against relying too much
   on literature as a means of transcendence. Instead, one should
   experience life for oneself. Thus, after describing his cabin's
   beautiful natural surroundings and his casual housekeeping habits,
   Thoreau goes on to criticize the train whistle that interrupts his
   reverie. To him, the railroad symbolizes the destruction of the good
   old pastoral way of life. Following is a description of the sounds
   audible from his cabin: the church bells ringing, carriages rattling
   and rumbling, cows lowing, [88]whip-poor-wills singing, owls hooting,
   frogs croaking, and [89]cockerels crowing.

   Solitude: Thoreau rhapsodizes about the beneficial effects of living
   solitary and close to nature. He loves to be alone, for "I never found
   the companion that was so companionable as solitude," and he is never
   lonely as long as he is close to nature. He believes there is no great
   value to be had by rubbing shoulders with the mass of humanity.

   Visitors: Thoreau writes about the visitors to his cabin. Among the 25
   or 30 visitors is a young French-Canadian woodchopper, Alec Therien,
   whom Thoreau idealizes as approaching the ideal man, and a runaway
   slave, whom Thoreau helps on his journey to freedom in Canada.

   The Bean-Field: Thoreau relates his efforts to cultivate two and a half
   acres of beans. He plants in June and spends his summer mornings
   weeding the field with a hoe. He sells most of the crop, and his small
   profit of $8.71 covers his needs.

   The Village: Thoreau visits the small town of Concord every day or two
   to hear the news, which he finds "as refreshing in its way as the
   rustle of the leaves." Nevertheless, he fondly but rather
   contemptuously compares Concord to a [90]gopher colony. In late summer,
   he is arrested for refusing to pay federal taxes, but is released the
   next day. He explains that he refuses to pay taxes to a government that
   supports slavery.

   The Ponds: In autumn, Thoreau rambles about the countryside and writes
   down his observations about the geography of Walden Pond and its
   neighbors: Flint's Pond (or Sandy Pond), White Pond, and Goose Pond.
   Although Flint's is the largest, Thoreau's favorites are Walden and
   White ponds. They are lovelier than diamonds, he says.

   Baker Farm: While on an afternoon ramble in the woods, Thoreau gets
   caught in a rainstorm and takes shelter in the dirty, dismal hut of
   John Field, a penniless but hard-working Irish farmhand, and his wife
   and children. Thoreau urges Field to live a simple but independent and
   fulfilling life in the woods, thereby freeing himself of employers and
   creditors. But the Irishman won't give up his dreams of luxury, which
   is the American dream.

   Higher Laws: Thoreau discusses whether hunting wild animals and eating
   meat is good. He concludes that the primitive, animal side of humans
   drives them to kill and eat animals, and that a person who transcends
   this propensity is superior to those who don't. (Thoreau eats fish.) In
   addition to [91]vegetarianism, he lauds chastity, work, and
   [92]teetotalism.

   Brute Neighbors: Thoreau briefly discusses the many wild animals that
   are his neighbors at Walden. A description of the nesting habits of
   [93]partridges is followed by a fascinating account of a massive battle
   between [94]red and [95]black ants. Three of the combatants he takes
   into his cabin and examines them under a microscope as the black ant
   kills the two smaller red ones. Later, Thoreau takes his boat and tries
   to follow a teasing [96]loon about the pond.

   House-Warming: After picking November berries in the woods, Thoreau
   bestirs himself to add a chimney and plaster the walls of his hut in
   order to stave off the cold of the oncoming winter. He also lays in a
   good supply of firewood, and expresses affection for wood and fire.

   Former Inhabitants; and Winter Visitors: Thoreau relates the stories of
   people who formerly lived in the vicinity of Walden Pond. Then he talks
   about the few visitors he receives during the winter: a farmer, a
   woodchopper, and a poet (Ellery Channing).

   Winter Animals: Thoreau amuses himself by watching wildlife during the
   winter. He relates his observations of owls, [97]hares, [98]red
   squirrels, mice, and various birds as they hunt, sing, and eat the
   scraps and corn he put out for them. He also describes a [99]fox hunt
   that passes by.

   The Pond in Winter: Thoreau describes Walden Pond as it appears during
   the winter. He claims to have sounded its depths and located an
   underground outlet. Then he recounts how 100 laborers came to cut great
   blocks of ice from the pond, the ice to be shipped to the
   [100]Carolinas.

   Spring: As spring arrives, Walden and the other ponds melt with
   [101]stentorian thundering and rumbling. Thoreau enjoys watching the
   thaw, and grows ecstatic as he witnesses the green rebirth of nature.
   He watches the geese winging their way north, and a hawk playing by
   itself in the sky. As nature is reborn, the narrator implies, so is he.
   He departs Walden on [102]September 8, [103]1847.

   Conclusion: This final chapter is more passionate and urgent than its
   predecessors. In it, he criticizes conformity: "If a man does not keep
   pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different
   drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or
   far away." By doing these things, men may find happiness and
   self-fulfillment.

     "I do not say that John or Jonathan will realize all this; but such
     is the character of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never
     make to dawn. The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us.
     Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to
     dawn. The sun is but a morning star."

[[104]edit] Themes

   Walden emphasizes the importance of self-reliance, solitude,
   contemplation, and closeness to nature in transcending the "desperate"
   existence that, he argues, is the lot of most humans. The book is not a
   traditional [105]autobiography, but combines autobiography with a
   social critique of contemporary Western culture's consumerist and
   materialist attitudes and its distance from and destruction of nature.
   That the book is not simply a criticism of society, but also an attempt
   to engage creatively with the better aspects of contemporary culture,
   suggested both by Thoreau's proximity to Concord society and by his
   admiration for classical literature. There are signs of ambiguity, or
   an attempt to see an alternative side of something common  the sound of
   a passing locomotive, for example, is compared to natural sounds.

   Walden is informed by [106]American Transcendentalism, a philosophy
   developed mostly by Thoreau's friend and spiritual mentor [107]Ralph
   Waldo Emerson. Emerson owned the land on which Thoreau built his cabin
   at Walden Pond, and Thoreau often used to walk over to Emerson's house
   for a meal and a conversation.

   Thoreau regarded his sojourn at Walden as a noble experiment with a
   threefold purpose. First, he was escaping the dehumanizing effects of
   the [108]Industrial Revolution by returning to a simpler, agrarian
   lifestyle. (However, he never intended the experiment to be permanent,
   explicitly advised that he did not expect all his readers to follow his
   example, and never wrote against technology or industry as such.)
   Second, he was simplifying his life and reducing his expenditures,
   increasing the amount of leisure time in which he could work on his
   writings (most of [109]A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers was
   written at Walden). Much of the book is devoted to stirring up
   awareness of how one's life is lived, materially and otherwise, and how
   one might choose to live it more deliberately  possibly differently.
   Third, he was putting into practice the Transcendentalist belief that
   one can best transcend normality and experience the Ideal, or the
   Divine, through nature.

[[110]edit] Critical response

   Scottish author [111]Robert Louis Stevenson judged Thoreaus endorsement
   of living alone in natural simplicity, apart from modern society, to be
   a mark of effeminacy, calling it "womanish solicitude; for there is
   something unmanly, something almost dastardly" about the
   lifestyle.^[112][1] Richard Zacks pokes fun at Thoreau in An
   Underground Education : The Unauthorized and Outrageous Supplement to
   Everything You Thought You Knew About Art, Sex, Business, Crime,
   Science, Medicine, and Other Fields of Human Knowledge saying:

     Thoreau's 'Walden, or Life in the Woods' deserves its status as a
     great American book but let it be known that Nature Boy went home on
     weekends to raid the family cookie jar. While living the simple life
     in the woods, Thoreau walked into nearby Concord, Mass., almost
     every day. And his mom, who lived less than two miles away,
     delivered goodie baskets filled with meals, pies and doughnuts every
     Saturday. The more one reads in Thoreau's unpolished journal of his
     stay in the woods, the more his sojourn resembles suburban boys
     going to their tree-house in the backyard and pretending they're
     camping in the heart of the jungle.^[113][2]

   Poet [114]John Greenleaf Whittier criticized what he perceived as the
   message in Walden that man should lower himself to the level of a
   [115]woodchuck and walk on four legs. He said: "Thoreau's Walden is a
   capital reading, but very wicked and heathenish... After all, for me, I
   prefer walking on two legs".^[116][3]

       local mountain.
     * Walden is mentioned throughout the season 8, [131]Frasier episode
       [132]Cranes Unplugged.
     * Walden is mentioned and discussed in [133]The Perks of Being a

       reference is made to it in many of his books.
     * In an episode of CBS' popular forensics drama [137]CSI, criminalist
       [138]Sara Sidle encounters her supervisor (and partner) [139]Gil
       Grissom reading Walden in his office, sparking a brief conversation
       about the book that sheds light on their relationship. This
       foreshadows a subsequent [140]episode, in which [141]Grissom
       explains that he is taking a sabbatical at the fictional Williams
       University, to research and teach a seminar on the life cycle of a
       local mosquito species at nearby [142]Walden Pond.
     * A [143]residential community in [144]Calgary, Alberta is named
       after the book.[145][1]
     * Larry and the Meaning of Life, the sequel to [146]Vote For Larry by
       [147]Janet Tashjian, takes place at Walden Pond and draws
       inspiration from Thoreau and Walden.
     * Walden is mentioned and discussed in The Adoration of Jenna Fox by
       Mary E. Pearson.
     * Walden School in [148]The Learning Center for the Deaf is named
       after the pond nearby.
     * Walden is a key reference point in [149]Jon Krakauer's '[150]Into
       The Wild' (an account of Alaskan adventurer [151]Christopher
