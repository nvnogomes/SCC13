   John Edward "Eddie" Murphy ([31]October 2, [32]1891 [33]February 21,
   [34]1969), nicknamed "Honest Eddie," was an [35]American [36]baseball
   player who played for three different [37]Major League [38]teams. In
   his 11-year career, Murphy played for the [39]Philadelphia Athletics,
   the [40]Chicago White Sox, and the [41]Pittsburgh Pirates.

   He appeared in three [42]World Series. His first two were with the
   Athletics in [43]1913 and [44]1914 World Series. Murphy appeared in the
   [45]1919 World Series as a member of the Chicago White Sox, a series
   most well known for the [46]Black Sox Scandal.

[[47]edit] Professional baseball career

   Murphy began his professional baseball career with the [48]Baltimore
   Orioles of the [49]Eastern League, later named the [50]International
   League. On [51]August 24, [52]1912, the Orioles traded Murphy and Jimmy
   Walsh to the Philadelphia Athletics for Bris Lord, Claud Derrick, and
   cash.^[53][1]

   Murphy played in his first Major League game on [54]August 26,
   [55]1912. Three years later, the Chicago White Sox purchased his
   contract. Murphy played the remainder of the [56]1915 and the next six
   season for the White Sox.

   In 1919, Murphy appeared in 30 games and hit for a .486 [57]batting
   average. That year, the White Sox made the World Series. It was an
   infamous series and as a result of the Black Sox Scandal, eight members
   of the White Sox were banned from Major League Baseball. Murphy was not
   one of those players. Consequently, he was given the nickname "Honest
   Eddie."^[58][2]

   Murphy ended his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates in [59]1926. In 11
   years, he had 680 [60]hits, 111 [61]stolen bases, and a .287 life-time
   batting average.
