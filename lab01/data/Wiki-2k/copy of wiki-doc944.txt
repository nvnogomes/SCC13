Edward L.R. Elson

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   The Reverend Edward L. R. Elson ([8]December 23, [9]1906 - [10]August
   25, [11]1993) was a [12]Presbyterian minister and [13]Chaplain of the
   United States Senate.

   Edward Lee Roy Elson, the oldest of nine children, was born in
   [14]Monongahela, Pennsylvania, to Leroy Elson, a locomotive engineer,
   and his wife, Pearl. Early on he was encouraged to study music and gave
   concerts in the [15]Pittsburgh area on the [16]cornet with his sister
   Hazel playing the piano. One of his favorite memories of high school
   was the time he and his sister gave a concert in the very early days of
   radio on [17]KDKA, the pioneer radio station.

   Dr. Elson was educated at [18]Asbury College in [19]Wilmore, Kentucky,
   and then went to [20]University of Southern California for a master's
   in theology. He married Frances Sandys, a fellow Asbury College student
   in 1929. At about the time of his ordination in 1930, he learned that
   his young wife had a very serious illness, and owing largely to this,
   he chose to go and serve at the La Jolla Presbyterian Church because of
   its proximity to the [21]Scripps Clinic in [22]La Jolla, California.
   His wife died three years later on his birthday.

   Having been invited to join the American Seminar in Europe and Russia,
   Elson took an eye-opening trip to Europe in the summer of 1936. Shortly
   after returning from Europe, Elson married Helen Chittick, a member of
   his church.

   After having been in the chaplain reserves for ten years, he resigned
   his position with the church and went on active duty with the Army in
   1941, arriving in France in December 1944. Not long after, General
   Frank Wilburn requested that Elson be his personal representative at
   the execution by firing squad of a soldier for [23]desertion. This
   soldier, [24]Eddie Slovik, was the first to be so executed by the
   American military since the [25]American Civil War. Another of his
   wartime assignments was to interview members of the clergy who had been
   imprisoned at [26]Dachau. After the German surrender, he was asked to
   represent [27]Dwight D. Eisenhower before the Consistory, a ruling body
   of the German Protestant church, in order to determine how the German
   Church would be rebuilt.

   Upon returning to the U.S. from the war, he soon learned that he was a
   candidate for the pastorate of the Covenant-First Presbyterian Church
   in [28]Washington, D.C. and ultimately became its pastor in 1946. One
   of his first duties there was to oversee the transition of the
   Covenant-First Presbyterian Church to the National Presbyterian Church,
   a move that had been in the works for many years. Eisenhower attended a
   pre-inaugural service at the church. A few days later, on February 1,
   1953, Dr. Elson baptized the president and admitted him to formal
   membership of the church. The baptism came after the president's
   brother, Milton, confirmed that though Ike had regularly attended the
   River Brethren Church in [29]Abilene, Kansas, he had never officially
   joined the church nor had he been baptized. In the 1960s, Elson
   oversaw, along with the building committee, the construction of a large
   new church, which was dedicated in 1967 on Eisenhower's birthday,
   October 14.

   In 1967, he was named to a special committee of the Presbyterian
   General Assembly to study the Vietnam War. In September 1967, while he
   and his wife were still at their summer home in [30]Cape Breton Island,
   he received a phone call from the [31]White House asking him to be on a
   team to observe the upcoming elections in [32]South Viet Nam.

   Dr. Elson was elected to the position of [33]Chaplain of the United
   States Senate in 1969, retiring from that position after having served
   for a little over twelve years in February, 1981. During his tenure at
   the Senate, he invited the first woman, Wilmina Rowland, to offer the
   opening prayer.
