[[19]edit] Summary

   Dutch Blitz () is a fast-paced, family oriented, action [20]card game
   played with a specially printed deck. The game was created by Werner
   Ernst George Muller, a German immigrant from Bucks County,
   [21]Pennsylvania. The game is very popular among the Pennsylvania
   [22]Amish and Dutch community, and among Christian groups in the United
   States and [23]Canada (primarily in Dutch and German communities). The
   game is essentially the same as [24]Nertz, with the essential
   difference being you can play Nertz with four standard playing decks,
   but must play Dutch Blitz on specialized decks.

   It is similar to and possibly derived from the European game of
   [25]Ligretto manufactured in Germany.

[[26]edit] Overview of Gameplay

[[27]edit] Deck contents:

     * 160 cards total:
          + 4 decks; Pump, Buggy, Plow, and Bucket.
               o Each deck includes 10 red (orange), 10 blue, 10 green,
                 and 10 yellow cards.

[[28]edit] Game Terminology

   Blitz Pile: This pile of 10 cards is the most important pile of cards
   to each player since it is the key towards "Blitzing" the other players
   when all cards from this pile have been cleared.

   Dutch Piles: Stacks of cards in each of the four colors - 1 through 10
   an ascending sequence - placed in the center of the table and played
   upon by all players. Each player accumulates scoring points here.

   Post Piles: Groups of cards placed to the left of both the Blitz and
   Wood piles in descending sequence For each player, the Post Piles serve
   as a "trading" or replacement area during the game. There are generally
   three post piles but in a two person game four or five post piles are
   often used to prevent the game from stalling.

   Wood Pile: Stack of cards built to the right of a player, from cards
   held in that player's hand.

[[29]edit] Objective

   The objective of Dutch Blitz is to score points by playing as many
   cards as possible on Dutch Piles, and by emptying your Blitz Pile as
   quickly as possible. You do this by playing cards from your Blitz Pile,
   Post Piles, and Wood Pile on the Dutch piles.

[[30]edit] Game End/Point Scoring

   The game ends when a player plays all 10 of the cards out of his/her
   Blitz Pile and yells "BLITZ!". Each player scores points at the end of
   each hand as follows:
    1. Add one point from the for each card card the player has used in
       the Dutch Piles
    2. Subtract two points for each card the player has left in his/her
       Blitz Pile

   Usually more rounds are played until one player reaches 100 cumulative
   points, yet some games have gone on for days at a time.
