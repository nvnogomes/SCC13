   Dungeons & Dragons (abbreviated as D&D or DnD)^[22][1] is a [23]fantasy
   [24]role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by [25]Gary Gygax and
   [26]Dave Arneson, and first published in 1974 by [27]Tactical Studies
   Rules, Inc. (TSR). The game is currently published by [28]Wizards of
   the Coast, a subsidiary of [29]Hasbro. It was derived from
   [30]miniature wargames with a variation of the [31]Chainmail game
   serving as the initial rule system.^[32][2] D&D's publication is widely
   regarded as the beginning of modern role-playing games and, by
   extension, the entire role-playing game industry.^[33][3]

   Players of D&D create [34]characters that embark upon imaginary
   adventures within a fantasy [35]setting. A [36]Dungeon Master
   (abbreviated as DM, also known as a Game Master or GM) serves as the
   game's referee and storyteller, while also maintaining the setting in
   which the adventures occur. During each game session, the players
   listen to descriptions of their character's surroundings, as well as
   additional information and potential choices from the DM, then describe
   their actions in response. The characters form a party that interacts
   with the setting's inhabitants (and each other). Together they solve
   dilemmas, engage in battles and gather treasure and knowledge.^[37][3]
   In the process the characters earn [38]experience points to become
   increasingly powerful over a series of sessions. D&D departs from
   traditional wargaming and assigns each player a specific [39]character
   to play instead of a [40]military formation. Miniature figures or
   markers, placed on a grid, are sometimes used to represent these
   characters.

   The early success of Dungeons & Dragons led to a proliferation of
   similar game systems, such as [41]Tunnels and Trolls,^[42][4]
   [43]Traveller and [44]RuneQuest.^[45][5] Despite this competition, D&D
   dominates the role-playing game industry, enjoying a nearly
   unassailable market position.^[46][6] In 1977, the game was split into
   two versions: the simpler Dungeons & Dragons and the more complex
   [47]Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (abbreviated as AD&D or
   ADnD).^[48][1]^[49][7] AD&D 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000,
   the simpler version of the game was discontinued and the complex
   version was renamed simply Dungeons & Dragons with the release of its
   3rd edition.^[50][8] Dungeons & Dragons version 3.5 was released in
   June 2003, with a 4th edition in June 2008.^[51][9]

   As of 2006, Dungeons & Dragons remains the best-known^[52][10] and
   best-selling^[53][11] role-playing game, with an estimated 20 million
   people having played the game and more than [54]US$1 billion in book
   and equipment sales.^[55][12] Dungeons & Dragons is known beyond the
   game for other [56]D&D-branded products, [57]references in popular
   culture and some of the [58]controversies that have surrounded it,
   particularly a [59]moral panic in the 1980s falsely linking it to
   [60]Satanism and [61]suicide.^[62][13]

[[84]edit] Play overview

   A D&D game session in progress

   Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. It
   is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a
   table-top. Typically, each player controls only a single character,
   which represents an individual in a fictional
   setting.^[85][14]^[86][15] As a group, these [87]player characters
   (PCs) are often described as a party of adventurers, with each member
   often having his or her own areas of specialty.^[88][16] During the
   course of play, each player directs the actions of his or her character
   and its interactions with the other characters in the
   game.^[89][17]^[90][18] A game often continues over a series of
   meetings to complete a single [91]adventure, and longer into a series
   of related gaming adventures, called a [92]campaign.^[93][19]

   The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the
   game are determined by the [94]Dungeon Master (DM) according to the
   rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules.^[95][20]
   The DM selects and describes the various [96]non-player characters
   (NPCs) the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions
   occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players'
   choices and actions.^[97][21]^[98][18] Encounters often take the form
   of battles with '[99]monsters'a generic term used in D&D to describe
   potentially hostile beings such as animals or mythical creatures. The
   game's extensive ruleswhich cover diverse subjects such as social
   interactions,^[100][22] [101]magic use,^[102][23]
   [103]combat,^[104][24] and the effect of [105]the environment on
   PCs^[106][25]help the DM to make these decisions. The Dungeon Master
   may choose to deviate from the published rules^[107][20] or make up new
   ones as he or she feels necessary.^[108][26]
   Release 3.5 of the three core rulebooks

   The most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three
   [109]core rulebooks: The [110]Player's Handbook, the [111]Dungeon
   Master's Guide and the [112]Monster Manual. A [113]Basic Game boxed set
   contains abbreviated rules to help beginners learn the game.^[114][27]

   The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character
   sheet for each player and a number of [115]polyhedral dice. The current
   editions also assume, but do not require, the use of [116]miniature
   figures or markers on a gridded surface. Earlier editions did not make
   this assumption.^[117][28] Many optional accessories are available to
   enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed
   [118]adventures and various [119]campaign settings.^[120][29]

[[121]edit] Game mechanics

          Main article: [122]Dungeons & Dragons game mechanics
          Main article: [123]Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)

   D&D uses [124]polyhedral [125]dice to resolve random events. These are
   abbreviated as a 'd' followed by the number of sides. From left, d4,
   d6, d8, d12, d20 and two d10, the last of which are used together as a
   d100, d%, or percentile die.

   Before the game begins, each player [126]creates his or her player
   character and records the details (described below) on a [127]character
   sheet. First, a player determines his or her character's [128]ability
   scores,^[129][30] which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity,
   Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has
   offered differing methods of determining these statistics; as of 4th
   Edition, players generally assign their ability scores from a list or
   use points to "buy" them.^[130][31] The player then chooses a [131]race
   (species) such as Human or Elf, a [132]character class (occupation)
   such as Fighter or Wizard, an [133]alignment (a moral and ethical
   outlook which may have a Good or Evil component, a Lawful or Chaotic
   component, or something in between), and a number of powers, skills and
   feats to enhance the character's basic abilities.^[134][32] Additional
   [135]background history, not covered by specific rules, is often also
   used to further develop the character.^[136][33]

   During the game, players describe their PC's intended actions, such as
   punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM
   [137]in characterwho then describes the result or response.^[138][34]
   Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked
   door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more
   complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice.^[139][18]
   Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability
   scores, skills and the difficulty of the task.^[140][35] In
   circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such
   as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a
   [141]saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage
   is reduced or avoided.^[142][36]^[143][37] In this case the odds of
   success are influenced by the character's class, levels and (with the
   3rd edition) ability scores.^[144][36]^[145][38]

   As the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally
   increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose)
   experience, skills^[146][39] and wealth, and may even alter their
   alignment^[147][40] or add additional character classes.^[148][41] The
   key way characters progress is by earning [149]experience points
   (XP/EXP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a
   difficult task.^[150][42] Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a
   [151]level, which grants the character improved class features,
   abilities and skills.^[152][43] XP can also be lost in some
   circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life
   energy, or by use of certain magical powers that require payment of an
   XP cost.^[153][44]

   [154]Hit points (HP) are a measure of a character's vitality and health
   and are determined by the class, level and constitution of each
   character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains
   wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most
   common way for a character to die in the game.^[155][45] Death can also
   result from the loss of key ability scores^[156][46] or character
   levels.^[157][47] When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead
   character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may
   be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired,
   the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the
   game.^[158][48]

[[159]edit] Adventures, campaigns and modules

          Main article: [160]Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)

   A typical Dungeons & Dragons game consists of an 'adventure', which is
   roughly equivalent to a single story.^[161][49] The DM can either
   design an adventure on his or her own, or follow one of the many
   additional [162]pre-made adventures (previously known as "modules")
   that have been published throughout the history of Dungeons & Dragons.
   Published adventures typically include a background story,
   illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some also include
   location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled
   '[163]Temple of the Frog' was included in the [164]Blackmoor rules
   supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone D&D module published by TSR
   was 1978s [165]Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, written by Gygax.

   A linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a
   '[166]campaign'.^[167][50] The locations where these adventures occur,
   such as a city, country, planet or an entire [168]fictional universe,
   are also sometimes called 'campaigns' but are more correctly referred
   to as 'worlds' or '[169]campaign settings'.^[170][51] D&D settings are
   based in various [171]fantasy subgenres and feature varying levels of
   magic and technology.^[172][52] Popular commercially published
   [173]campaign settings for Dungeons & Dragons include [174]Greyhawk,
   [175]Dragonlance, [176]Forgotten Realms, [177]Mystara,
   [178]Spelljammer, [179]Ravenloft, [180]Dark Sun, [181]Planescape,
   [182]Birthright and [183]Eberron.^[184][53] Alternatively, DMs may
   develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.
   Several Dungeons & Dragons miniature figures. The grid mat underneath
   uses one-inch squares.

[[185]edit] Miniature figures

   The [186]wargames from which Dungeons & Dragons evolved used
   [187]miniature figures to represent combatants. D&D initially continued
   the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors.
   The original D&D set of 1974 required the use of the Chainmail
   miniatures game for combat resolution.^[188][54] By the publication of
   the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus
   miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players
   continued to use them as a visual reference.^[189][55]

   In the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures
   specifically for Dungeons & Dragons and similar games. Licensed
   [190]miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include
   [191]Grenadier Miniatures (19801983),^[192][56] [193]Citadel Miniatures
   (19841986),^[194][57] [195]Ral Partha,^[196][58] and TSR
   itself.^[197][59] Most of these miniatures used the 25 [198]mm scale,
   with the exception of Ral Parthas 15 mm scale miniatures for the 1st
   edition Battlesystem.^[199][60]^[200][61]

   Periodically, Dungeons & Dragons has returned to its wargaming roots
   with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming.
   Supplements such as [201]Battlesystem (1985 & 1989) and a new edition
   of [202]Chainmail (2001)^[203][62] provided rule systems to handle
   battles between armies by using miniatures.

   Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition (2000) assumes the use of
   [204]miniatures to represent combat situations in play, an aspect of
   the game that was further emphasized in the v3.5 revision. The
   [205]Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures Game (2003) is sold as sets of
   plastic, randomly assorted, pre-painted miniatures, and can be used as
   either part of a standard Dungeons & Dragons game or as a stand-alone
   [206]collectible miniatures game.^[207][63]

[[208]edit] Game history

[[209]edit] Sources and influences

          Main article: [210]Sources and influences on the development of
          Dungeons & Dragons

   The immediate predecessor of Dungeons & Dragons was a set of medieval
   miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by
   [211]Gary Gygax, whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before
   the game was published as [212]Chainmail. [213]Dave Arneson used
   Chainmail to run games where players controlled a single character
   instead of an army, an innovation that inspired D&D.^[214][2] Developed
   with Arneson's help from his modified version of Chainmail for his
   Blackmoor campaign,^[215][64] Gygax wrote "The Fantasy Game", the
   role-playing game (RPG) that became Dungeons & Dragons
   (D&D).^[216][1]^[217][65]

   Many Dungeons & Dragons elements also appear in hobbies of the mid- to
   late twentieth century (though these elements also existed previously).
   Character-based role playing, for example, can be seen in
   [218]improvisational theatre.^[219][66] Game-world simulations were
   well-developed in [220]wargaming. Fantasy milieus specifically designed
   for gaming could be seen in [221]Gloranthas board games among
   others.^[222][5] Ultimately, however, Dungeons & Dragons represents a
   unique blending of these elements.

   The theme of D&D was influenced by [223]mythology, [224]pulp fiction,
   and contemporary fantasy authors of the 1960s and 1970s. The presence
   of [225]halflings, [226]elves, [227]dwarves, [228]half-elves,
   [229]orcs, [230]dragons, and the like, often draw comparisons to the
   work of [231]J.R.R. Tolkien. Gygax maintained that he was influenced
   very little by [232]The Lord of the Rings (although the owners of that
   works copyright forced the name changes of hobbit to 'halfling', ent to
   'treant', and balrog to 'Type VI demon [balor]'), stating that he
   included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity
   of the work.^[233][67]^[234][68]

   The magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are used up
   once cast (and must be re-memorized the next day), was heavily
   influenced by the [235]Dying Earth stories and novels of [236]Jack
   Vance.^[237][69] The original alignment system (which grouped all
   players and creatures into Law, Neutrality and Chaos) was derived from
   the novel [238]Three Hearts and Three Lions by [239]Poul
   Anderson.^[240][70] A troll described in this work also influenced the
   D&D definition of that monster.^[241][68]

   Other influences include the works of [242]Robert E. Howard, [243]Edgar
   Rice Burroughs, [244]A. Merritt, [245]H. P. Lovecraft, [246]Fritz
   Leiber, [247]L. Sprague de Camp, [248]Fletcher Pratt, [249]Roger
   Zelazny, and [250]Michael Moorcock.^[251][71] Monsters, spells, and
   magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of
   individual works ranging from [252]A. E. van Vogts Black Destroyer,
   [253]Coeurl (the [254]Displacer Beast), [255]Lewis Carrolls
   [256]Jabberwocky ([257]vorpal sword) to the [258]Book of Genesis (the
   clerical spell Blade Barrier was inspired by the flaming sword which
   turned every way at the gates of [259]Eden).^[260][70]

[[261]edit] Edition history

          Main article: [262]Editions of Dungeons & Dragons

   Dungeons & Dragons has gone through several revisions. Parallel
   versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to
   distinguish between the different editions.
   The original Dungeons & Dragons set.

   The [263]original Dungeons and Dragons, now referred to as OD&D was a
   small box set of three booklets published in 1974. It was amateurish in
   production and written from a perspective that assumed the reader was
   familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless it exploded in popularity, first
   among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of
   [264]college and [265]high school students. This first set went through
   many printings and was supplemented with several official additions,
   such as the original [266]Greyhawk and [267]Blackmoor supplements (both
   1975)^[268][72], as well as magazine articles in TSRs official
   publications and countless [269]fanzines.

[[270]edit] Two-pronged strategy

   In 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that
   would divide the D&D game for over two decades. A [271]Basic Dungeons &
   Dragons boxed set was introduced^[272][65] to clean up the presentation
   of the essential rules, make the system understandable to the general
   public, and placed in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. In
   1978 Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) was published,^[273][65] which
   brought together the various published rules, options and corrections,
   then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers.
   The basic set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that
   game to switch to the advanced rules.

   Unfortunately, almost from its inception, differences of design
   philosophy caused this dual marketing approach to go awry. Gygax, who
   wrote the advanced game, wanted an expansive game with rulings on any
   conceivable situation which might come up during play. J. Eric Holmes,
   the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room
   for personal improvisation. As a result, the basic game included many
   rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in the advanced
   game. Confusing matters further, the original D&D boxed set remained in
   publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for
   TSR.^[274][5]

   Advanced Dungeons & Dragons was designed to create a tighter, more
   structured game system than the loose framework of the original
   game.^[275][7] While seen by many as a revision of D&D,^[276][8] AD&D
   was at the time declared to be "neither an expansion nor a revision of
   the old game, it is a new game".^[277][7] The AD&D game was not
   intended to be directly compatible with D&D and it required some
   conversion to play between the rule sets.^[278][73] The term Advanced
   described the more complex rules and did not imply "for higher-level
   gaming abilities". Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks,
   commonly referred to as the 'core rulebooks', were released: the
   [279]Players Handbook (PHB), the [280]Dungeon Masters Guide (DMG), and
   the [281]Monster Manual (MM). Several supplementary books were
   published throughout the 1980s, notably [282]Unearthed Arcana (1985)
   that included a large number of new rules.^[283][65]

[[284]edit] Revised editions

   In 1981 Basic Dungeons & Dragons was revised by Tom Moldvay. However,
   the rules for the Dungeons & Dragons game continued to diverge and it
   became a separate and distinct product from TSRs flagship game, AD&D.
   This game was promoted as a continuation of the original D&D tone,
   whereas AD&D was an advancement of the mechanics.^[285][7] Although
   simpler overall than the 'Advanced' game, it included rules for some
   situations not covered in AD&D. There were five sets: Basic (1977,
   revised in 1981 and again in 1983), Expert (1981, revised in 1983),
   Companion (1983), Master (1985), and Immortals (1986, revised in 1991).
   Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the
   previous.^[286][74] The first four sets were later compiled as a single
   hardcover book, the [287]Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991).
   First edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide.

   Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition, sometimes referred to as AD&D2
   or 2nd Ed, was published in 1989,^[288][65] again as three core
   rulebooks; the primary designer was [289]David "Zeb" Cook. The Monster
   Manual was replaced by the [290]Monstrous Compendium, a loose-leaf
   binder that was replaced by the hardcover [291]Monstrous Manual in
   1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still
   referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition,^[292][75] and a series of
   Players Option manuals were released as optional core
   rulebooks.^[293][65]

   The release of AD&D2 deliberately excluded some aspects of the game
   that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils,
   sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character
   typessuch as assassins and half-orcswere removed.^[294][76] The edition
   moved away from a theme of 1960's and 1970's "sword and sorcery"
   fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and
   mythology.^[295][77] The rules underwent minor changes, including the
   addition of non-weapon proficienciesskill-like abilities that
   originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements. The game's magic spells
   were divided into schools and spheres.^[296][1] A major difference was
   the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional
   fantasy. This included blending fantasy with other genres, such as
   horror (Ravenloft), science fiction (Spelljammer), and apocalyptic
   (Dark Sun), as well as alternative historical and non-European
   mythological settings.^[297][78]

[[298]edit] Wizards of the Coast

   In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was purchased by [299]Wizards of the
   Coast. Following three years of development, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd
   Edition was released in 2000.^[300][79] This game is referred to as
   D&D3 or 3E and is not to be confused with the 1983 edition of the basic
   D&D game. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into
   a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the D&D rules to
   date, and also served as the basis for a multi-genre role-playing
   system designed around 20-sided dice, called the [301]d20
   System.^[302][80] The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally
   consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game,
   allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted
   to play.^[303][81] Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules
   to encourage further customization of characters.^[304][82] The new
   rules also standardized the mechanics of action resolution and
   combat.^[305][83]

   In 2003, Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5, also known as Revised 3rd Edition or
   D&D3.5, was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This
   release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and
   expanded the core rulebooks.^[306][83]

   In early 2005 Wizards of the Coast's R&D team started to develop
   Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, prompted mainly by the feedback
   obtained from the D&D playing community and a desire to make the game
   faster, more intuitive and a better play experience than it was under
   3rd Edition. The new game was developed through a number of design
   phases spanning from May 2005 until its release.^[307][84]

   Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition was announced at [308]Gen Con in August
   2007, and the initial three core books were released June 6,
   2008.^[309][9] 4th Edition streamlined the game into a simplified form
   and introduced numerous rules changes. Many character abilities were
   restructured into 'Powers'. These altered the spell-using classes by
   adding abilities that could be used at will, per encounter or per day.
   Likewise, non-magic-using classes were provided with parallel sets of
   options. Wizards of the Coast is releasing other supplementary material
   virtually through their website,^[310][85]^[311][86] including the
   capability for online play via a virtual 3-D tabletop.^[312][87]

[[313]edit] Acclaim and influence

   Beginning with a [314]French language edition in 1982, Dungeons &
   Dragons has been translated into many languages besides the original
   English.^[315][65]^[316][1] By 2004, more than US$1 billion has been
   spent on Dungeons & Dragons products, and the game has been played by
   more than 20 million people.^[317][12] As many as 6 million people
   played the game in 2007.^[318][87]

   The various editions of Dungeons & Dragons have won many [319]Origins
   Awards, including All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977, Best
   Roleplaying Rules of 1989 and Best Roleplaying Game of 2000 for the
   three flagship editions of the game.^[320][88] Both Dungeons & Dragons
   and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons are Origins Hall of Fame Games
   inductees as they were deemed sufficiently distinct to merit separate
   inclusion on different occasions.^[321][89] The independent [322]Games
   magazine placed Dungeons & Dragons on their Games 100 list from 1980
   through 1983, then entered the game into the magazines Hall of Fame in
   1984.^[323][90]^[324][91]

   Dungeons & Dragons was the first modern role-playing game and it
   established many of the conventions that have dominated the
   genre.^[325][92] Particularly notable are the use of [326]dice as a
   [327]game mechanic, [328]character record sheets, use of [329]numerical
   attributes and gamemaster-centered group dynamics.^[330][93] Within
   months of Dungeons & Dragonss release, new role-playing game writers
   and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most
   of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other
   role-playing games inspired by D&D include [331]Tunnels and Trolls
   (1975),^[332][4] [333]Empire of the Petal Throne (1975) and
   [334]Chivalry and Sorcery (1976).^[335][94]

   The role-playing movement initiated by D&D would lead to release of the
   science fiction game [336]Traveller (1977) and fantasy game
   [337]RuneQuest (1978), and subsequent game systems such as
   [338]Chaosiums [339]Call of Cthulhu (1981), [340]Champions (1982),
   [341]GURPS (1986)^[342][95] and [343]Vampire: The Masquerade
   (1992).^[344][96]^[345][5] Dungeons & Dragons and the games it
   influenced also fed back into the genres originminiatures wargameswith
   combat strategy games like [346]Warhammer Fantasy Battles.^[347][97]
   D&D also had a large impact on modern [348]video games.^[349][98]

   Director [350]Jon Favreau credits Dungeons & Dragons with giving him
   "...a really strong background in imagination, storytelling,
   understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance."^[351][99]

[[352]edit] Licensing

   Further information: [353]Variant Dungeons & Dragons games

   Early in the games history, TSR took no action against small
   publishers' production of D&D compatible material. This attitude
   changed in the mid 1980s when TSR revoked these rights (even from
   publishers they had earlier officially licensed, such as [354]Judges
   Guild),^[355][100] and took legal action to prevent others from
   publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to
   resentment by the other gaming companies.^[356][5] TSR itself also ran
   afoul of intellectual property law in several
   cases.^[357][101]^[358][102]

   With the launch of Dungeons & Dragonss [359]3rd Edition, Wizards of the
   Coast made the [360]d20 System available under the [361]Open Game
   License (OGL) and [362]d20 Trademark License. Under these licenses,
   authors are free to use the d20 System when writing games and game
   supplements.^[363][103] The OGL and d20 Trademark License also made
   possible new games, some based on licensed products like [364]Star
   Wars, and also new versions of older games, such as [365]Call of
   Cthulhu.

   During the 2000s, there has been a trend towards recreating older
   editions of D&D. [366]Necromancer Games, with its slogan "Third Edition
   Rules, First Edition Feel"^[367][104] and Goodman Games Dungeon Crawl
   Classics range^[368][105] are both examples of this in material for d20
   System. Other companies have created complete game systems based on
   earlier editions of D&D. An example is [369]HackMaster (2001) by
   [370]Kenzer and Company, a licensed, non-OGL, semi-satirical follow-on
   to 1st and 2nd Edition.^[371][106] [372]Castles & Crusades (2005), by
   Troll Lord Games, is a reimagining of early editions by streamlining
   rules from OGL^[373][107] that was supported by [374]Gary Gygax prior
   to his death.^[375][108]

   With the release of the fourth edition, Wizards of the Coast has
   introduced its [376]Game System License, which represents a significant
   restriction compared with the very open policies embodied by the OGL.
   In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as [377]Paizo
   Publishing with its [378]Pathfinder RPG) who previously produced
   materials in support of the D&D product line, have made the decision to
   continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly
   with Wizards of the Coast.^[379][109]^[380][110]

[[381]edit] Controversy and notoriety

          Main article: [382]Dungeons & Dragons controversies

   At various times in its history, Dungeons & Dragons has received
   negative publicity, in particular from some [383]Christian groups, for
   alleged promotion of such practices as [384]devil worship,
   [385]witchcraft, [386]suicide, and [387]murder, and for naked
   [388]breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original AD&D
   manuals (mainly monsters such as [389]Harpies, [390]Succubi,
   etc.).^[391][13]^[392][111] These controversies led TSR to remove many
   potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the 2nd
   Edition of AD&D.^[393][76] Many of these references, including the use
   of the names [394]devils and [395]demons, were reintroduced in the 3rd
   edition.^[396][112] The [397]moral panic over the game also led to
   problems for fans of D&D who faced further social ostracism, unfair
   treatment and false association with the occult and [398]Satanism,
   regardless of an individual fans actual religious affiliation and
   beliefs.^[399][113]

   Dungeons & Dragons has also been the subject of rumors regarding
   players having difficulty separating fantasy and reality, even leading
   to [400]psychotic episodes.^[401][114] The most notable of these was
   the saga of [402]James Dallas Egbert III,^[403][115] which was
   fictionalized in the novel [404]Mazes and Monsters and later made into
   a [405]TV movie.^[406][116]^[407][111] The game was also blamed for
   some of the actions of [408]Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990
   of murdering his stepfather. Research by various
   psychologists,^[409][117] the first being that of Armando Simon, have
   concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of
   D&D.^[410][118]

   The games commercial success was a factor that led to [411]lawsuits
   regarding distribution of [412]royalties between original creators
   Gygax and Arneson.^[413][119]^[414][120] Gygax later became embroiled
   in a political struggle for control of TSR which culminated in a court
   battle and Gygaxs decision to sell his ownership interest in the
   company in 1985.^[415][121]

   including [418]Dragon Magazine, [419]Dungeon Magazine, an [420]animated
   television series, a [421]film series, an [422]official role-playing
   soundtrack and [423]computer games such as the [424]MMORPG
   [425]Dungeons & Dragons Online: Stormreach. Hobby and toy stores sell
   [426]dice, [427]miniatures, [428]adventures and other game aids related
   to D&D and its game offspring.

[[429]edit] References in popular culture

          Main article: [430]Dungeons & Dragons in popular culture

   As the popularity of D&D grew throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, the
   game was referenced more and more in popular culture. Numerous games,
   films and cultural references based on D&D or D&D-like fantasies,
   characters or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the
   1970s. Typically, though by no means exclusively, D&D players are
   portrayed derogatively as the epitome of [431]geekdom.^[432][122]
   References to the game are used as shorthand to establish
   characterization or provide the punch line of a
   joke.^[433][123]^[434][124] Famous D&D players include professional
   basketball player [435]Tim Duncan, comedian [436]Stephen Colbert,
   musician [437]Moby, and actors [438]Vin Diesel, [439]Matthew Lillard,
   [440]Mike Myers, [441]Patton Oswalt, [442]Wil Wheaton and [443]Robin
