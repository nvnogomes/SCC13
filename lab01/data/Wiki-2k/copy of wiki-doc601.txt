   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edward Archibald Mitchell ([8]December 2, [9]1910 - [10]December 11,
   [11]1979) was a [12]U.S. Representative from [13]Indiana, a
   [14]military leader and a businessman.

   Born in [15]Binghamton, New York, Mitchell attended the Binghamton
   schools and had three years of college training at the [16]American Law
   Institute and [17]Columbia University, [18]New York City. He moved to
   [19]Evansville, Indiana, in September 1937. He engaged as a
   warehouseman and later as district manager for a large food distributor
   1934-1937. In 1937 Mitchell purchased a half interest in a [20]food
   marketing and brokerage company and served as president. At age
   twenty-seven after purchasing part of the company he had accumulated a
   net worth of over one million dollars which with inflation would be at
   the very least $14.3 million today.

   Following his success in the food service industry he served in the
   [21]United States Navy from November 1942 until his discharge as a
   [22]lieutenant commander in January 1946, having been commanding
   officer of underwater demolition teams in the [23]Pacific Theater for
   two years. He was awarded the [24]Silver Star Medal at [25]Okinawa
   following his honourable discharge.

   Mitchell was elected as a [26]Republican to the [27]Eightieth Congress
   ([28]January 3, [29]1947-[30]January 3, [31]1949). He was an
   unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1948 to the [32]Eighty-first
   Congress. He served as delegate in 1952 and 1956 to Republican National
   Conventions. In March 1971 Mitchell, who was sixty at the time,
   infamously decked Congressman [33]Hale Boggs, 57, with one punch in the
   men's room of the Statler Hilton during a Congressional dinner; Boggs
   threatened suit; Mitchell famously replied he "would meet Boggs in
   court or in gym". The original argument was due Congressman Mitchell's
   objection to the abusive cracks that Boggs was making about the
   [34]Nixon Administration.

   Mitchell resided in [35]Evansville, Indiana, where he died [36]December
   11, [37]1979. He was interred in Sunset Memorial Park.
