   Mani Menon (born [16]July 09, [17]1948) in [18]Trichur, [19]India, is
   an [20]American [21]surgeon and the director of the [22]Vattikuti
   Urology Institute at the [23]Henry Ford Hospital in [24]Detroit, MI.
   Menon is widely regarded as a pioneer in the development of [25]robotic
   surgery techniques for the treatment of patients with [26]prostate
   cancer^[27][1]^[28][2]^[29][3].
   In May 2008, Menon received the prestigious [30]B.C. Roy award from the
   [31]President of India, under the category of "Eminent Medical Person"
   for his achievements in the fields of [32]urology and robotics^[33][4].
   He is profiled in the [34]Americas Top Doctors list and in the
   International [35]Who's Who in the World in Biology and Medicine. He is
   currently the symposium director of the [36]International Robotic
   Urology Symposium^[37][5].

[[46]edit] Early years and urological career

   A native of Kerala, India, he joined the newly established
   [47]Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research
   (JIPMER) in [48]Pondicherry, [49]India^[50][1]. After graduating in
   1969, he completed his residency at the Brady Urological Institute at
   the [51]John Hopkins Hospital. Working with the institutes
   [52]chairman, Dr. Patrick Walsh, Menon developed a novel technique to
   measure [53]androgen receptors in the human prostate^[54][6]. Menon
   would quickly climb the academic ranks in urology. At the age of 34,
   Menon became the chairman of the Urology department at the
   [55]University of Massachusetts Medical Center in [56]Worcester,
   [57]Massachusetts^[58][6].
   Dr. Menon has published more than 300 papers, 90 book chapters and
   invited articles^[59][7] mostly in the field of robotic
   [60]prostatectomy, [61]renal transplantation and [62]urolithiasis. He
   has been an invited lecturer and guest professor over 70 times at
   institutions all over the world. His work of research has been
   published in many urological journals such as the [63]Journal of
   Clinical Investigation, the [64]Journal of Biological Chemistry, the
   [65]American Journal of Physiology, [66]Proceedings of the National
   Academy, the [67]New England Journal of Medicine and many more^[68][7].

[[69]edit] Robotic surgery

   In 1997, Menon was recruited to become chairman of urology at Henry
   Ford Hospital in to revive the prostate cancer program. In 2001, Henry
   Ford Hospitals urology department would receive a $20 million donation
   from the Vattikuti foundation^[70][8]. The donation helped establish
   the [71]Vattikuti Urology Institute (VUI) and would allow Menons team
   to explore minimally invasive means of treating prostate cancer.
   Menon and the staff at the VUI would develop robotic procedures in
   general (for example, bladder, kidney cancer) and the prostatectomy in
   particular^[72][9]. The robotic prostatectomy developed by Menon is
   called the [73]Vattikuti Institute Prostatectomy. Specialised
   laparoscopic instruments are used for the procedure^[74][9]^[75][10].
   During the operation, images from a 3-D camera are projected to a
   remote console. The surgeons operates in virtual reality, observing the
   images on a screen. This technology serves to make the surgery less
   invasive and more precise. Menon has performed nearly 4,000 robotic
   prostatectomies^[76][11] and is considered a world authority on the use
   robotic surgery for prostate cancer^[77][9].

   In his years as Director of VUI, Menon has trained and mentored fellow
   surgeon, [78]Ashutosh Tewari. To this day, Menon and Tewari collaborate
   on clinical manuscripts, research [79]abstracts, conference lectures,
   and other projects. Both surgeons have significantly influenced the
   field of robotic surgery as it applies to urology, refining patient
   outcomes as well as boosting the surgical robot industry^[80][12].

[[103]edit] Collaboration with NYU Langone School of Medicine

   In March 2008, Menon and a surgical team from the [104]Vattikuti
   Urology Institute entered a joint collaboration with Dr. Herbert Lepor
   and his team at the Department of Urology at the [105]NYU School of
   Medicine at [106]New York University^[107][14]. The objective of this
   collaboration was to expand resident education, patient care and
   academic exchange between the institutions in the field of urology.
   Combined initiatives include female urology, [108]oncology,
   [109]minimally invasive surgery, basic research, and outcome analysis.
