Dual-channel architecture

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Dual channel)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   Dual-channel architecture describes a technology that theoretically
   doubles data throughput from the memory to the [9]memory controller.
   Dual-channel-enabled memory controllers utilize two 64-bit data
   channels, resulting in a 128-bit data path.

[[15]edit] Operation

   Dual-channel architecture requires a dual-channel-capable motherboard
   and two or more [16]DDR, [17]DDR2 SDRAM, or [18]DDR3 SDRAM memory
   modules. The memory modules are installed into matching banks, which
   are usually color coded on the [19]motherboard. These separate channels
   allow each memory module access to the memory controller, increasing
   throughput bandwidth. It is not required that identical modules be
   used, but this is often recommended for best compatibility for dual
   channel operation. It is possible to use a single-sided module of
   512 [20]MB^[21][1] and a double-sided module of 512 MB in dual-channel
   configuration, but how fast and stable it is depends on the memory
   controller.

   If the motherboard has two pairs of differently colored DIMM sockets
   (the colors indicate which bank they belong to, bank 0 or bank 1), then
   one can place a matched pair of memory modules in bank 0, but a
   different-capacity pair of modules in bank 1, as long as they are of
   the same speed. Using this scheme, a pair of 1 [22]GB memory modules in
   bank 0 and a pair of matched 512 MB modules in bank 1 would be
   acceptable for dual-channel operation.^[23][2]

   Modules rated at different speeds can be run in dual-channel mode,
   although the motherboard will then run all memory modules at the speed
   of the slowest module. Some motherboards, however, have compatibility
   issues with certain brands or models of memory when attempting to use
   them in dual-channel mode. For this reason, it is generally advised to
   use identical pairs of memory modules, which is why most memory
   manufacturers now sell "kits" of matched-pair [24]DIMMs. Several
   motherboard manufacturers only support configurations where a "matched
   pair" of modules are used. A matching pair needs to match in:
     * Capacity (e.g. 1024 MB). Certain Intel chipsets support different
       capacity chips in what they call Flex Mode: the capacity that can
       be matched is run in dual-channel, while the remainder runs in
       single-channel.
     * Speed (e.g. PC5300). If speed is not the same, the lower speed of
       the two modules will be used. Likewise, the higher latency of the
       two modules will be used.
     * Number of chips and sides (e.g. 2 sides with 4 chips on each side).

   Dual-channel architecture is a technology implemented on motherboards
   by the motherboard manufacturer and does not apply to memory modules.
   Theoretically any matched pair of memory modules may be used in either
   single- or dual-channel operation, provided the motherboard supports
   this architecture.

[[25]edit] Purpose

   Graphic illustrating bottleneck between CPU, RAM, and other peripherals

   Dual-channel technology was created to address the issue of
   [26]bottlenecks. Increased processor speed and performance requires
   other, less prominent components to keep pace. In the case of dual
   channel design, the intended target is the memory controller, which
   regulates data flow between the CPU and system memory (RAM). The memory
   controller determines the types and speeds of RAM as well as the
   maximum size of each individual memory module and the overall memory
   capacity of the system. When the memory is unable to keep up with the
   processor, however, a bottleneck occurs, leaving the CPU with nothing
   to process. Under the single-channel architecture, any CPU with a bus
   speed greater than the memory speed would be susceptible to this
   bottleneck effect.

   The dual-channel configuration alleviates the problem by doubling the
   amount of available memory bandwidth. Instead of a single memory
   channel, a second parallel channel is added. With two channels working
   simultaneously, the bottleneck is reduced. Rather than wait for memory
   technology to improve, dual-channel architecture simply takes the
   existing RAM technology and improves the method in which it is handled.
   While the actual implementation differs between [27]Intel and [28]AMD
   motherboards, the basic theory stands.

[[29]edit] Performance

   [30]Tom's Hardware found little significant difference between
   single-channel and dual-channel configurations in synthetic and gaming
   benchmarks (using a "modern" system setup). In their tests, dual
   channel gave at best a 5% speed increase in memory-intensive tasks, not
   even close to the two times that the term "dual" suggests.^[31][3] It
   should be noted that the test results published by Tom's Hardware had a
   discrete graphics comparison. The difference can be far more
   significant in applications that manipulate large amounts of data in
   memory.^[32][4]
