   Echols County is a [27]county located in the [28]U.S. state of
   [29]Georgia. It is part of the [30]Valdosta, [31]Georgia
   [32]Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of 2000, the population is 3,754.
   The 2007 Census Estimate shows a population of 4,093 [33][1]. The
   [34]county seat is [35]Statenville, [36]Georgia^[37][1]. Statenville is
   not an incorporated municipality, making Echols County one of only
   three counties in Georgia to have an unincorporated county seat.

   Established in 1858, from the parts of [38]Lowndes and [39]Clinch the
   county was named in honor of Robert Milner Echols (1798-1847). Echols
   was born in Georgia and served in the state legislature for many years.
   He was killed in the [40]Mexican-American War, and is buried in Georgia
   (though not in Echols County).

   Echols county has become notable in recent years as it has served as a
   place of banishment for many of Georgia's criminals. As the Georgia
   State Constitution forbids banishment from the state, the judiciary has
   developed a way around this legislation by banishing such criminals
   from 158 of Georgia's 159 counties, sending them to Echols. No such
   criminal has been documented as actually moving to Echols. As it is the
   least populous county in the state, they have instead left the state
   altogether.
