   Ducts are used in [19]heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
   ([20]HVAC) to deliver and remove air. These needed airflows include,
   for example, supply air, return air, and exhaust air.^[21][1] Ducts
   also deliver, most commonly as part of the supply air, [22]ventilation
   air. As such, air ducts are one method of ensuring acceptable
   [23]indoor air quality as well as [24]thermal comfort.

   A duct system is often called ductwork. Planning ('laying out'),
   sizing, optimizing, detailing, and finding the pressure losses through
   a duct system is called duct design.^[25][2]

[[43]edit] Duct materials

   Like modern steel food cans, at one time air ducts were often made of
   tin, like 'tin cans' were made for food. Tin is more corrosion
   resistant than plain steel, but is also more expensive. With
   improvements in mild steel production, and its galvanization to resist
   [44]rust, steel 'sheet metal' has replaced tin in ducts as well as food
   cans. However, the term tin-knocker or tin-basher is still used in
   practice to describe sheet metal duct installers.

   Today, if we consider all the materials which allow us to construct
   ducts in rectangular, round, or oval cross-sectional shapes, we will
   find that the four main ones are:

[[45]edit] Galvanized steel

   Ducts are still most often made of galvanized steel. Various fittings
   allow transitioning between the various shapes and sizes. A "tee"
   connection, for example, is where the air flow can be divided into two
   or more downstream branches. Many factory-made shapes and sizes are
   available but galvanized steel can easily be [46]cut and bent to form
   additional shapes when required. Steel ducts are commonly wrapped or
   lined with [47]fiberglass [48]thermal insulation, both to reduce heat
   loss or gain through the duct walls and water vapor from [49]condensing
   on the exterior of the duct when the duct is carrying cooled air.
   Insulation, particularly duct liner, also reduces duct-borne noise.
   Both types of insulation reduce 'breakout' noise through the ducts'
   sidewalls.

[[50]edit] Polyurethane and Phenolic insulation panels (preinsulated aluminum
ducts)

   While as mentioned above, galvanized steel is still very common, more
   and more [51]rectangular ducts are being manufactured from rigid
   insulation panels, thanks to the fact that custom or special shapes and
   sizes of ducts can easily be shop or field fabricated. In addition to
   the fact that ducts made with rigid insulation panels do not need any
   further insulation. Among the various types of rigid [52]polyurethane
   foam panels available, a new water formulated panel stands out. In this
   particular panel, the foaming process is obtained through the use of
   water instead of the [53]CFC, HCFC, HFC and HC gasses. The foam panels
   are then coated with [54]aluminum sheets on either side, with
   thicknesses that can vary from 80 [55]micrometres for indoor use to 200
   micrometres for external use in order to guarantee the high mechanical
   characteristics of the duct. The ducts construction starts with the
   plotting of the single pieces on the panel. The pieces are then cut
   from the panel (with a 45 cut as explained below), bent if necessary in
   order to obtain the different fittings, and finally closed through an
   operation of gluing, pressing and taping. Having obtained the various
   duct sections, they can easily be installed by using an invisible
   aluminum [56]flange system.

[[57]edit] Fiberglass duct board (preinsulated non metallic ductwork)

   Also the fiberglass panels provide built-in thermal insulation and the
   interior surface absorbs [58]sound, helping to provide quiet operation
   of the HVAC system. The duct board is formed by sliding a
   specially-designed [59]knife along the board using a straightedge as a
   guide; the knife automatically trims out a "valley" with 45 sides; the
   valley does not quite penetrate the entire depth of the duct board,
   providing a thin section that acts as a [60]hinge. The duct board can
   then be folded along the valleys to produce 90 folds, making the
   rectangular duct shape in the fabricator's desired size. The duct is
   then closed with staples and special aluminum or similar 'metal-backed'
   tape. Commonly available [61]duct tape should not be used on air ducts,
   metal, fiberglass, or otherwise, that are intended for long-term use;
   the adhesive on so called 'duct tape' dries and releases with time.

[[62]edit] Flexible tubing

   Flexible ducts, known as flex, have a variety of configurations, but
   for HVAC applications, they are typically flexible plastic over a metal
   wire coil to make round, flexible duct. Most often a layer of
   fiberglass insulation covers the duct, and then a thin plastic layer
   protects the insulation. Flexible duct is very convenient for attaching
   supply air outlets to the rigid ductwork. However, the pressure loss
   through flex is higher than for most other types of ducts. As such,
   designers and installers attempt to keep their installed lengths (runs)
   short, e.g., less than 15 feet or so, and to minimize turns. Kinks in
   flex must be avoided. Flexible duct is normally not used on the
   negative pressure portions of HVAC duct systems.

[[63]edit] Fabric Ducts

   Fabric ducts, also known as air socks, duct socks or textile ducts, are
   designed for even air distribution throughout the entire length.
   Usually made of special permeable polyester material, fabric ducts act
   like a conventional system with much more diffusers. Fabric ducts are
   normally used where even air distribution is essential. Due to the
   nature or the air distribution, textile ducts are not usually concealed
   within false ceilings, because of this, they are manufactured in
   various colours to coordinate with the interior. Fabric ducts fitted
   above a ceiling will need to be pvc coated so that no maintenance is
   required to maintain performance. Because air passes through the body
   of a textile duct, it is impossible for condensation to form on the
   ducts surface, they can therefore be used where air is to be supplied
   below the dew point, without needing to be insulated. Also see [64]air
   sock

[[65]edit] Duct system components

   Besides the ducts themselves, complete ducting systems contain many
   other components.

[[66]edit] Vibration isolators

   A duct system often begins at an [67]air handler. The [68]blowers in
   the air handlers can create substantial [69]vibration and the large
   area of the duct system would transmit this [70]noise and vibration to
   the inhabitants of the building. To avoid this, vibration isolators
   (flexible sections) are normally inserted into the duct immediately
   before and after the air handler. The rubberized canvas-like material
   of these sections allow the air handler to vibrate without transmitting
   much vibration to the attached ducts.

[[71]edit] Take-offs

   Downstream of the air handler, the supply air trunk duct will commonly
   fork, providing air to many individual air outlets such as
   [72]diffusers, grilles, and registers. When the system is designed with
   a main duct branching into many subsidiary branch ducts, fittings
   called take-offs allow a small portion of the flow in the main duct to
   be diverted into each branch duct. Take-offs may be fitted into round
   or rectangular openings cut into the wall of the main duct. The
   take-off commonly has many small metal tabs that are then bent to
   retain the take-off on the main duct; round versions are called spin-in
   fittings. Other take-off designs use a snap-in attachment method,
   sometimes coupled with an adhesive foam gasket to provide improved
   sealing. The outlet of the take-off then connects to the rectangular,
   oval, or round branch duct.

[[73]edit] Stacks, boots, and heads

   Ducts, especially in homes, must often allow air to travel vertically
   within relatively thin walls. These vertical ducts are called stacks
   and are formed with either very wide and relatively thin rectangular
   sections or oval sections. At the bottom of the stack, a stack boot
   provides a transition from an ordinary large round or rectangular duct
   to the thin wall-mounted duct. At the top, a stack head can provide a
   transition back to ordinary ducting while a register head allows the
   transition to a wall-mounted air register.

[[74]edit] Volume Control Dampers

   Ducting systems must often provide a method of adjusting the volume of
   air flow to various parts of the system. VCD's (Volume Control Dampers
   - Not To Be confused with Smoke/Fire Dampers) provide this function.
   Besides the regulation provided at the registers or diffusers that
   spread air into individual rooms, [75]dampers can be fitted within the
   ducts themselves. These dampers may be manual or automatic. [76]Zone
   dampers provide automatic control in simple systems while [77]VAVs
   allow control in sophisticated systems.

[[78]edit] Smoke/Fire Dampers

   Smoke and Fire dampers are found in ductwork, where the duct passes
   through a firewall or firecurtain. Smoke dampers are automated with the
   use of a mechanical motor often referred to as an Actuator. A probe
   connected to the motor is installed in the run of duct, and detects
   smoke within the duct system which has been extracted from a room, or
   which is being supplied from the AHU (Air Handling Unit) or elsewhere
   within the run. Once smoke is detected within the duct, the Actuator
   triggers the motor release and the smoke damper will automatically
   close until manually re-opened.

   You will also find Fire dampers in the same places as smoke dampers,
   depending on the application of the area after the firewall. Unlike
   smoke dampers, they are not triggered by any electrical system, which
   is perfect in the event of an electrical failure where the Smoke
   dampers would fail to close. A fire damper is held open by a bar
   crossing the corrigated screen, which will break and allow the damper
   to close when air in the duct is above a certain temperature. This
   again will then have to be manually re-opened.

[[79]edit] Terminal units

   While single-zone [80]constant air volume systems typically don't have
   them, other types of air distribution systems often have terminal units
   in the branch ducts. Usually there is one terminal unit per [81]thermal
   zone. Some types of terminal units are VAV 'boxes' of either single or
   dual duct, fan-powered mixing boxes of either parallel or series
   arrangement, and induction terminal units. Terminal units may also
   include either, or both, a heating or cooling coil.

[[82]edit] Air terminals

   'Air terminals' are the supply air outlets and 'return' or 'exhaust air
   inlets'. For supply, [83]diffusers are most common, but [84]grilles,
   and for very small HVAC systems such as in residences, 'registers' are
   also used widely. Return or 'exhaust grilles' are used primarily for
   appearance reasons, but some also incorporate an air filter and are
   known as 'filter returns'.^[85][3]

[[86]edit] Duct cleaning

   The position of the [87]U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is that
   "If no one in your household suffers from allergies or unexplained
   symptoms or illnesses and if, after a visual inspection of the inside
   of the ducts, you see no indication that your air ducts are
   contaminated with large deposits of dust or mold (no musty odor or
   visible mold growth), having your air ducts cleaned is probably
   unnecessary."^[88][4] Studies by the EPA and the Canadian Mortgage and
   Housing Corporation (CMHC) in the 1990s has lead CMHC to conclude that
   "duct cleaning will not usually change the quality of the air you
   breathe, nor will it significantly affect airflows or heating
   costs".^[89][5]

   SIGNS AND INDICATORS: When cleaning, you need to sweep and dust your
   furniture more than usual. After cleaning, there's still left over dust
   floating around the house that you can see. After or during sleep you
   experience headaches, nasal congestion, or other sinus problems. Rooms
   in your house have little or no air flow coming from the vents. You're
   constantly getting sick or are experience more allergies than usual
   When you turn on the furnace or air conditioner there's musty or stale
   odor You're experiencing signs of sickness: fatigue, headache,
   sneezing, stuffy or running nose, irritability, nausea, dry or burning
   sensation in eyes, nose and throat.
