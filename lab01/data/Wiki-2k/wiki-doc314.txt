[[57]edit] Geography and water resources

   The [58]San Leandro Hills run above the city to the northeast. In the
   lower elevations of the city, an upper regionally contained [59]aquifer
   is located 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m) below the surface. At least one
   deeper [60]aquifer exists approximately 250 feet (75 m) below the
   surface. Some [61]salt water intrusion has taken place in the San
   Leandro Cone. Shallow [62]groundwater generally flows to the west, from
   the foothills toward the [63]San Francisco Bay. Shallow groundwater is
   contaminated in many of the locales of the lower elevation of the city.
   Contamination by [64]gasoline, volatile organic compounds and some
   [65]heavy metals has been recorded in a number of these lower elevation
   areas.^[66][2]^[67][3]

[[68]edit] Demographics

   As of the [69]census^[70][4] of 2000, there were 79,452 people, 30,642
   households, and 19,825 families residing in the city. The
   [71]population density was 2,336.4/km (6,355.0/mi). There were 31,334
   housing units at an average density of 921.4/km (2,387.2/mi). The

[[91]edit] History

   The first inhabitants of San Leandro were the ancestors of the
   [92]Ohlone Nation, who arrived sometime between 3500 and 2500 BC. The
   Spanish settlers called these natives Costeos or "coast people" and the
   English-speaking settlers called them Costanoans. San Leandro was first
   visited by Europeans on [93]March 20, [94]1772 by Spanish soldier
   Captain [95]Pedro Fages and the Spanish [96]Catholic [97]priest
   [98]Father Crespi. Forty-eight years later, to increase settlement and
   strengthen their claim to the Bay Area, the Spanish gave to retired
   Spanish soldier Don [99]Lus Mara Peralta a 43,000 [100]acre (174 km)
   land grant which he named [101]Rancho San Antonio. In 1842, Don
   [102]Jos Joaquin Estudillo, also a retired Spanish [103]soldier (for
   whom Estudillo Ave. is named), was granted 7,000 acres (28 km) of land
   in the San Leandro area, which he named Rancho San Leandro.

   In 1849 the [104]Gold Rush struck California, and thousands journeyed
   to the state in search of wealth and prosperity. However, many who were
   not successful in the gold fields soon moved on to the [105]San
   Francisco Bay Area, and settled in the San Leandro area. As a result of
   this increased settlement, in 1855 John Ward, the son-in-law of Joaquin
   Estudillo, filed a map of a townsite to be called San Leandro with the
   County government. From 1856 to 1868, San Leandro was the County Seat
   for Alameda County until the County Courthouse located at Clarke and
   Davis Streets was destroyed by the [106]1868 Hayward earthquake.
   Afterwards, [107]Oakland became the county seat, largely because it was
   to be the terminal of the proposed [108]Central Pacific Railroad. San
   Leandro was incorporated as a town on [109]March 21, [110]1872, one
   hundred years and a day after the area was discovered by Europeans.

   San Leandro industry continued to develop during the late 1800s, thanks
   to the San Francisco, Alameda and Stockton Railroad Company, which
   offered inexpensive transportation. Built in 1865, the line ran from
   [111]Alameda to Davis Street, and many factories were located on or
   adjacent to the rail line. In San Leandro, [112]agriculture continued
   to be an important industry up until the early 1900s. [113]Cherries
   were one of the City's most well-known crops and, to honor their
   importance to San Leandro's development, the first Cherry Festival, a
   tradition which continues today, was held in 1909.

   During and after [114]World War II, San Leandro underwent explosive
   population growth. For example, from 1940 to 1950, and again from 1950
   to 1960, the population doubled and thousands of homes sprang up in the
   community. In addition to population growth, from April 1942 to October
   1965, 87 industrial parcels were annexed to the City, in addition to 27
   other non-industrial tracts. Following the war, San Leandro's
   manufacturing and commercial sectors continued to expand. New shopping
   centers, such as the Pelton Plaza on East 14th Street, were opened to
   meet the expanding residential demand for commercial services. Even the
   city government underwent change, as the San Leandro charter was
   revised in 1947 and a new zoning law was passed.

   By the late 1960s, the city was largely built out, with almost no land
   available for development or annexation. Because many of the residents
   who moved to San Leandro in the 1950s and 1960s have stayed here, San
   Leandro as of 2007 has a large elderly population, although increasing
   numbers of families with children have begun moving into the city. In
   the 1980s, the community's diversity grew as African Americans, Asian
   Americans, and Hispanics also began moving into the city. In addition,
   the industrial makeup of the city has been changing, moving away from
   its traditional manufacturing base toward more of an emphasis on
   services and warehousing industries.

   San Leandro was an 86.4% white-non hispanic community according to the
   1970 census. [115]African-Americans were excluded by the use of
   "covenants"^[116][5] as well as the collusion of real estate agents,
   some of whom refused to sell houses to African-Americans. The police
   sometimes harassed African-Americans who crossed the border into San
   Leandro from Hayward and Oakland.

   [117]Jack Maltester became the first directly-elected mayor in 1962 and
   was re-elected three times until term limits were enacted in 1974.

   San Leandro became a more diverse city with the massive development of
   apartment buildings going from 74.4% white-non hispanic in 1980 to
   42.3% white-non hispanic in 2000.

[[118]edit] Economy

   San Leandro is home to many corporate businesses such as [119]JanSport,
   [120]The North Face, [121]Ghirardelli and [122]Otis Spunkmeyer. It also
   has four shopping malls, the [123]Bayfair Center, [124]Westgate Center,
   Greenhouse Shopping Center, and Marina Square Center.

[[125]edit] High School History & Education

   In the latter part of the 20th century, San Leandro was home to three
   high schools: [126]San Leandro High School, [127]Pacific High School
   (in the San Leandro Unified School District) and [128]Marina High
   School (located within the San Leandro city limits but coming under the
   authority of the neighboring [129]San Lorenzo Unified School District).
   San Leandro High School was established in the early part of the 20th
   century. As the city's population grew, so did the need for a second
   high school. Pacific High School was built across town nearer the
   industrial area adjacent to State Route 17 (now Interstate 880) and
   opened in 1960. It featured a round main building and more traditional
   outbuildings, as well as a lighted football field. (The football field
   at San Leandro High School did not have, and still does not have,
   lights. All night games for both high schools were played at the
   Pacific football field, named C. Burrell Field after a former San
   Leandro Unified School District superintendent. San Leandro High
   School's night football games are still played there.)

   As student enrollments declined in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the
   school board elected to close one of the two high schools. Amid much
   controversy, Pacific High School graduated its last class in 1983.
   Those who wished to keep Pacific High School open cited the fact that
   it was a much newer facility and had the better football field. Those
   who were in favor of retaining San Leandro High School maintained that
   it was a larger campus and therefore had more room to house both school
   populations. Some Pacific High School supporters to this day hold the
   opinion that San Leandro High School was retained because it was
   located on the "rich" side of town.

   Instead of leasing out the Pacific High School property for a few years
   until birth rates recovered and school enrollments were back on the
   rise, in 1989 the school district sold the property on which the school
   facility was located but retained Burrell Field. The developers who
   purchased the site have since constructed an outlet mall (Marina Square
   Center) on the former school site.

   In recent years, as school enrollments have increased, San Leandro High
   School has been the recipient of newly built wings to increase
   classroom space and relieve overcrowding.

   San Leandro High School is home to such academic programs as the
   Business Academy and SLAM. One of the award winning national programs
   located in San Leandro is DECA, an association for marketing students.
   Recently six students from San Leandro High School won in their
   competitive events and won a slot to compete in Orlando, Florida on
   April 27 2007. The overall quality of San Leandro High School is in
   question, however, as indicated by its [130]low API index and ranking
   of 4 compared to all other schools in California and 2 when compared to
   other similar schools (Scale of 1-10). The campus is also characterized
   by [131]frequent violence between differing ethnic groups. In 2005
   there were [132]419 suspensions and 21 outright expulsions (see pg
   2)(15.9% of the entire school). There have been numerous accusations
   toward the school board about [133]ignoring pupils using false
   addresses from nearby troubled communities, inflating the schools
   population causing overcrowding.

   A number of students residing in San Leandro attend [134]San Lorenzo
   Unified School District schools, including [135]Arroyo High School,
   Washington Manor Middle School and Corvallis Elementary School, due to
   proximity to the San Leandro/San Lorenzo border.

   The rest of San Leandro is served by [136]San Leandro Unified School
   District.

[[137]edit] Government

   City Hall

   Today San Leandro is governed by [138]mayor Tony Santos, whose first
   term started in December 2006 and a six-member City Council. City
   Council members include Michael Gregory (District 1), Ursula Reed
   (District 2), Diana Souza (District 3), Joyce Starosciak (District 4),
   Bill Stephens (District 5), and Jim Prola (District 6).

   San Leandro is home to two school districts: The San Lorenzo Unified
   School District includes parts of Washington Manor and the San Leandro
   Unified School District includes most of San Leandro plus a small part
   of [139]Oakland. The 7-member [140]School Board for San Leandro Unified
   School District is composed of Hermy Almonte (Area 1), Pauline Cutter
   (Area 2), Carmen Sullivan (Area 3), Mike Katz-Lacabe (Area 4), Diana
   Prola (Area 5), Lisa Hague (Area 6) and Morgan Mack-Rose (At-Large).
