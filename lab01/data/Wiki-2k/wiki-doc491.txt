   The Duluth Model or Domestic Abuse Intervention Project is a program
   developed to reduce domestic violence. The Duluth model was developed
   by Minnesota Program Development, Inc., a [13]nonprofit agency in
   [14]Duluth, [15]Minnesota.

[[21]edit] Origin and Theory

   In 1981, the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project was the first
   multi-disciplinary program designed to address the issue of
   [22]domestic violence. This experiment, conducted in Duluth, involved
   coordinating the actions of a variety of agencies that deal with
   domestic situations. The program has become a model for other
   [23]jurisdictions seeking to deal more effectively with domestic
   violence.

   According to the Duluth Model, "women and children, and some men are
   vulnerable to violence because of their unequal social, economic, and
   political status in society."

   The Duluth Model is based on a strict "[24]patriarchal violence" model
   and presumes that all violence in the home and elsewhere has a male
   perpetrator and female victim. The model explicitly rejects any concept
   of mutuality or symmetry in [25]abusive relationships. The Duluth Model
   originated the Duluth Power and Control Wheel.

[[26]edit] Effectiveness

   A nationwide study published in 2002 sponsored by the federal
   government found that batterers who complete programs based on the
   "Duluth Model," are less likely to repeat acts of domestic violence
   than those who don't.^[27][1] A 2005 study led by Larry Bennett, a
   professor of social work at the University of Illinois at Chicago and
   an expert on batterer intervention programs, of the 30 batterer
   intervention programs in [28]Cook County, [29]Illinois, found 15
   percent of those who completed the program were rearrested for domestic
   violence, compared with 37 percent of those who dropped out of the
   program.^[30][1] However, Bennett said the studies are largely
   meaningless because they lacked a proper control group.^[31][1] He
   added that participants who complete domestic violence programs are
   likely to be more motivated than others to improve behavior and would
   be less inclined to offend again.^[32][1]

[[33]edit] Criticism

   Critics say the problem with programs based on the Duluth Model is that
   they ignore research linking domestic violence to substance abuse and
   psychological problems, such as attachment disorders, traced to
   childhood abuse or neglect.^[34][1]

   Donald Dutton, a psychology professor at the University of British
   Columbia who has studied abusive personalities, states that "The Duluth
   Model was developed by people who didn't understand anything about
   therapy." He also insists that gender doesn't play a role in domestic
   violence.^[35][1]

   The exclusive focus on men as perpetrators and the rejection of
   [36]system dynamics models has been criticized from perspectives
   influenced by [37]psychology, [38]education and [39]remedial therapy.
   The fields of psychology, psychiatry, and social work all provide for
   application of skill learning, improved social understanding and
   practiced behavioral mastery to help establish alternative behaviors.
   By contrast, the Duluth Model presents only "once an abuser, always an
   abuser" constructions to the social problem of domestic violence.
