   (January 2008)

   Disordered eating is a term that is used by some people^[[14]who?] to
   describe a wide variety of irregularities in eating behavior that do
   not warrant a diagnosis of a specific [15]eating disorder such as
   [16]anorexia nervosa or [17]bulimia nervosa. People who have this kind
   of disordered eating patterns may be diagnosed with an [18]eating
   disorder not otherwise specified. A change in eating patterns can also
   be caused by other [19]mental disorders (e.g. [20]clinical depression),
   or by factors that are generally considered to be unrelated to mental
   disorders (e.g. extreme home-sickness).^[21][1]

   Some people think that disordered eating patterns that are not the
   result of a specific [22]eating disorder are less serious than symptoms
   of disorders like [23]anorexia nervosa. Others note that individual
   cases of disordered eating may involve serious problems with food and
   body image. Additionally, certain types of disordered eating can
   include symptoms from both classic cases of anorexia and bulimia,
   making the disordered eating as dangerous as regular eating disorders.

   Some counselors are specialized in dealing with disordered eating
   patterns. The recognition that some people have eating problems that do
   not fit into the scope of regular specific eating disorders makes it
   possible for a larger proportion of people who have eating problems to
   receive help.
