   Djpavk

   Djpavk is a small village in the North-West of [9]Iceland. It is
   located at the head of [10]Reykjarfjrur on the [11]Strandir coast in
   the [12]Westfjords region (Vestfirir), in the municipality of
   [13]rneshreppur.

   It is approximately 70 km away from [14]Hlmavk (the nearest settlement
   of any account), 280 km from [15]safjrur and 340 km from the country's
   capital [16]Reykjavk. At present it only consists of seven houses, a
   hotel and the ruinous remains of a herring factory. It can be reached
   by car via road 643 or by plane via the nearby [17]Gjgur Airstrip.

[[18]edit] History of settlement

   Djpavk was first settled in 1917 when [19]Elas Stefnsson build a hering
   salting factory there. However, due to economic depression, this
   enterprise went bankrupt in 1919 and, although the business was briefly
   taken over by others, the site was abandoned during the 1920s.

   1934 saw the resettlement of Djpavk with the foundation of Djpavk Ltd.
   in September of that year. A new factory was build (at the time of its
   construction it was the biggest concrete building in Iceland and one of
   the biggest in Europe) and despite the harsh conditions the
   construction was completed within the span of just one year and the
   factory was operational by July 1935. Initial worries that the catches
   would not meet requirements proved unfounded and during its early years
   the enterprise boomed, bringing improved financial status and living
   standards to the whole region.

   Herring catches started to decline after 1944, with a sharp drop in
   1948 (when there were almost no catches for two years) and, despite
   attempts to keep the enterprise running by processing other fish
   besides herring, the factory closed in 1954 while Djpavk Ltd. was
   officially wind down in 1968. After this the residents moved away and
   the settlement was abandoned again.

   In 1985 Htel Djpavk was established in the old women's quarters and
   conservation of the factory and other buildings began.
