Uniform civil number

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Edinen Grazhdanski Nomer)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   The uniform civil number ([9]Bulgarian: ; abbreviated: , EGN) is a
   10-digit unique number assigned to each [10]Bulgarian citizen or
   resident foreign national. It serves as a [11]national identification
   number. An EGN is assigned to Bulgarians at birth, or when a [12]birth
   certificate is issued. The uniform system for civil registration and
   administrative service of population ([13]Bulgarian: ; abbreviated: ,
   ESGRAON) regulates the EGN system.

[[20]edit] Structure

   The initial six digits correspond to the birth date (YYMMDD). Since
   there are only two digits reserved for the year, only years between
   1900 and 1999 can be encoded directly. Other years get represented as
   follows:
     * for births before [21]1 January [22]1900, 20 is added to the month
     * for births from [23]31 January [24]1999 to [25]31 December
       [26]2099, 40 is added to the month

   The next three digits designate the birth order number, the third digit
   being even for males and odd for females.

   The tenth digit is a checksum, calculated using the following
   [27]algorithm:
    1. Each digit is multiplied by its weight (see below)
    2. The products obtained are added
    3. The sum is divided by 11 ( use sum % 11, not /, modulus, not
       division)
    4. If the remainder is less than 10, the remainder is the checksum
       digit, otherwise the checksum digit is zero

+------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| Position   |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |
+------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| Weight     |  x2 |  x4 |  x8 |  x5 | x10 |  x9 |  x7 |  x3 |  x6 |     |
+------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   The weights are the powers of 2, modulo 11. (See also: [28]Galois field
   applications)

[[29]edit] Information leakage

   The last digits of an EGN can reveal with reasonable accuracy the
   birthplace of a Bulgarian citizen, because of the long-lasting practice
   of assigning numbered sheets of paper to municipal ESGRAON divisions.
   Other divisions directly add the birth sequence number to the last 3
   digits of their EKNM (a regional identifier) and possibly another 1
   depending on the baby's sex. This practice is denied by ESGRAON
   officers, but is nevertheless used by civil authorities as a rule of
   thumb for checking the validity of an identity document.^[[30]citation

[[31]edit] Examples of valid EGN numbers

     * 7523169263 a male, born on [32]16 March [33]1875
     * 8032056031 a female, born on [34]5 December [35]1880
     * 8001010008 a male, born on [36]1 January [37]1980
     * 7501020018 a female, born on [38]2 January [39]1975
     * 7552010005 a male, born on [40]1 December [41]2075
     * 7542011030 a female, born on [42]1 February [43]2075

[[44]edit] Misuse

   In order to easily cross borders criminals have been known to change
   EGNs. There were 46 such cases detected in March 2005.

   Using the EGN system for identification raised some privacy concerns,
   though they are officially considered personal information and are
   protected by law.
