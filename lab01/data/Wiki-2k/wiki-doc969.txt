[[21]edit] Personal life

   Feulner was born to Helen Joan Feulner and Edwin J. Feulner Sr., owner
   of a Chicago real estate firm, and grew up in [22]Elmhurst, Illinois.
   He is a [23]Roman Catholic. Feulner and his wife, Linda Claire
   Leventhal, have two adult children, Edwin J. Feulner III and Emily V.
   Lown, and three grandchildren. They live in [24]Alexandria, Virginia.

[[25]edit] Education

   Feulner received a [26]bachelor's degree in English from [27]Regis
   University and in 1964 completed an [28]MBA from the University of
   Pennsylvania's [29]Wharton School of Business. He later earned a
   doctorate at the [30]University of Edinburgh and attended
   [31]Georgetown University as well as the [32]London School of
   Economics. While in college, Feulner read Sen. [33]Barry Goldwater's
   book [34]The Conscience of a Conservative, which Feulner cites as a key
   influence on his political outlook.^[35][1]

[[36]edit] Early career

   Feulner began his Washington career as analyst for the [37]Center for
   Strategic and International Studies, then called the Center for
   Strategic Studies. He later became a congressional aide to congressman
   (and later Secretary of Defense) [38]Melvin Laird. Feulner subsequently
   became a long-serving executive assistant to Illinois Republican
   congressman [39]Phil Crane. Prior to becoming President of Heritage,
   Feulner was Executive Director of the Republican Study
   Committee.^[40][2]

[[41]edit] Heritage Foundation

   Feulner was a Founding Trustee of the Heritage Foundation from 1973
   until 1977, when he left Crane's employ to run Heritage full-time. At
   the time, Heritage had had nine employees and four presidents in four
   years. Feulner brought a new focus to marketing Heritage's ideas by
   issuing and promoting policy papers. The practice was unusual for
   Washington think tanks in the 1970s, and it brought national attention
   to Heritage. As Feulner related to [42]The Washington Examiner, "It
   doesn't do us any good to have great ideas if we are not out there
   peddling our products."^[43][2]

   He is the former President and currently serves as the Treasurer of the
   [44]Mont Pelerin Society; he has served as Trustee and former Chairman
   of the Board of the [45]Intercollegiate Studies Institute; Member of
   the Board of the National Chamber Foundation; a Board Member of the
   Institut d' Etude Politique; and member of the Board of Visitors of
   Regis, his undergraduate alma mater.

   Among other executive and advisory roles, Feulner is the former
   President of [46]The Philadelphia Society, and past Director of the
   Sequoia Bank, the [47]Council for National Policy, the [48]Acton
   Institute and the American Council in Germany.

   Feulner served as a member of the [49]Gingrich-[50]Mitchell
   Congressional [51]U.N. Reform Task Force (2005), [52]Meltzer Commission
   from 1999-2000. He was the Vice Chairman of the National Commission on
   Economic Growth and Tax Reform, known as the Kemp Commission, from
   1995-1996. He also was Chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on
   Public Diplomacy (1982-91), a consultant for domestic policy to
   President Reagan, and an adviser to several government departments and
   agencies.

[[53]edit] Awards and distinctions

   In 1989 he was awarded the [54]Presidential Citizens Medal, the second
   highest civilian award in the United States awarded by the President of
   the United States, by former U.S. President [55]Ronald Reagan. He is
   also past president and current Treasurer and Trustee of the [56]Mont
   Pelerin Society, a global economics society. Since 2006, Feulner has
   been a member of the Honorary Board of Trustees of Fundacin Burke in
   [57]Spain.

   In 2007 [58]GQ magazine named Feulner one of the "50 most powerful
   people in D.C."^[59][3] The same year, Feulner was named one of the
   "100 most influential" American conservatives by the UK
   [60]Telegraph.^[61][4]

   He speaks in the United States and abroad, has been awarded 11 honorary
   degrees and has received honors from the governments of Taiwan and
   South Korea.
