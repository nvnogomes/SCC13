   Title Release date Released for Information
   [34]Spyro the Dragon 1998 [35]PlayStation, [36]PlayStation Network
   [37]Spyro The Dragon was first released in [38]North America on
   [39]September 10, [40]1998, for the [41]Sony PlayStation. It was
   released in [42]Europe on [43]October 23, [44]1998, [45]Australia on
   [46]November 15, [47]1998 and in [48]Japan on [49]April 1, [50]1999. It
   is a platform game that placed the player as Spyro, a small, purple
   dragon set with the task of freeing his fellow dragons from crystal
   prisons, which are scattered around their world. Each level is accessed
   through 'portals' from a main world. The game concludes with a fight
   between Spyro and the primary antagonist, [51]Gnasty Gnorc. Although
   there were other boss levels guarding each home world, many of these
   were optional and did not have to be beaten to progress in the game.
   Spyro's primary abilities were gliding, charging and fire-breathing.
   The game sold well, most critics giving it favorable reviews.^[52][1]
   It also received acclaim for its musical score by [53]Stewart Copeland.
   [54]Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage 1999 [55]PlayStation, [56]PlayStation
   Network(Removed) [57]Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage (also known Spyro x Sparx:
   Tondemo Tours in Japan, "Spyro: Gateway to Glimmer" in Europe) followed
   on from the success of the first title, making its release on
   [58]November 2, [59]1999 in the USA. It was released three days later
   in Europe and Australia and in [60]March 16, [61]2000 in Japan. In the
   game, Spyro and Sparx, enter a portal to Dragon Shores in search of a
   vacation. However, in another land ([62]Avalar) it is shown that a
   professor has altered the path of a portal, thus causing Spyro and
   Sparx to end up in Avalar. They learn from their new friends that a
   malicious wizard and main antagonist [63]Ripto, aided by his magical
   scepter and two lackeys, Crush and Gulp, is taking over the
   once-peaceful lands. The game introduced many new characters including
   Hunter, a [64]cheetah; Elora, a [65]faun; The Professor, a [66]mole;
   and Zoe, a [67]fairy. The structure of the game is similar to the
   first, with levels being accessed from the three main home worlds,
   Summer Forest, Autumn Plains, and Winter Tundra. The game introduces
   some new abilities for Spyro, including hovering after a glide,
   swimming underwater, climbing ladders, head-bashing, and the ability to
   use power-ups. Unlike the original game, boss fights were now mandatory
   to advance to the next home world. Like its predecessor it got very
   good critical acclaim.^[68][2]
   [69]Spyro: Year of the Dragon 2000 [70]PlayStation [71]Spyro: Year of
   the Dragon was released in Autumn 2000 for North America, Europe and
   Australia, and it was the last Spyro game to be created by
   [72]Insomniac. This is the only game in the original trilogy to not be
   released in [73]Japan.^[74][3]

   In this game, the dragons are celebrating the coming of dragon
   [75]eggs, an event that takes place every twelve years. A mysterious
   anthropomorphic rabbit girl, [76]Bianca, along with an army of rhynocs,
   comes to the dragon worlds by rabbit holes and steals all the eggs.
   Spyro, the only dragon small enough, follows her down a rabbit hole to
   the other side of the world - to the [77]Forgotten Realms. There they
   meet many new allies, some of which are also playable characters in
   their own miniature levels - [78]Sheila the [79]kangaroo, [80]Sgt. Byrd
   the flying, missile-shooting [81]penguin, [82]Bentley the kindly
   [83]yeti, and [84]Agent 9 the hyperactive, laser-wielding [85]monkey.
   They find that the mastermind behind the egg stealing is the
   [86]Sorceress. As they go through the worlds, they find out that the
   Sorceress stole the eggs due to her hatred of the dragons. As in the
   previous games, levels are accessed from a central home world, of which
   there are four: Sunrise Spring, Midday Gardens, Evening Lake, and
   Midnight Mountain. The third installment of the Spyro series also
   features levels in which the player controls Sparx in a bird's eye view
   shooting game. Insomniac Games President Ted Price stated in an
   interview about [87]Resistance: Fall of Man that they stopped creating
   Spyro games because the player character, Spyro, was too limited for
   them to add new features and actions (Ted states, as an example, that
   "he didn't even have hands, he couldn't even hold a gun.")^[88][4]
   [89]Spyro: Season of Ice 2001 [90]Game Boy Advance [91]Spyro: Season of
   Ice was the first Spyro on the Game Boy Advance, and the first game to
   not be developed by [92]Insomniac Games or be on a Sony Console.
   [93]Spyro 2: Season of Flame 2002 [94]Game Boy Advance [95]Spyro 2:
   Season of Flame was the second Spyro game on the Game Boy Advance. It
   introduced new features such as Spyro being able to breathe multiple
   breaths.
   [96]Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly 2002 [97]Playstation 2, [98]Nintendo
   Gamecube [99]Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly was the first game in the Spyro
   series for [100]PlayStation 2 and [101]GameCube and was developed by
   Equinox Digital Entertainment and Check Six Studios. Spyro: Enter the
   Dragonfly had mixed responses from reviewers ^[102][5], referring to
   the numerous glitches, lack of storyline, originality, and long load
   times.

   The story kicks off right after the Sorceress was defeated in Spyro:
   Year of the Dragon. The baby dragons are now preparing to receive their
   dragonflies, a rite of passage in any dragon's life (although in the
   earlier games, none of the dragons besides Spyro has a dragonfly). It's
   a huge celebration filled with joy and happiness until Ripto comes to
   capture the dragonflies, making the dragons helpless. He attempts to
   cast a spell, but he makes a mistake which causes them to be scattered
   across the world.
   [103]Spyro: Attack of the Rhynocs 2003 [104]Game Boy Advance
   [105]Spyro: Attack of the Rhynocs was the third Spyro game on the Game
   Boy Advance. In europe it was titled: "Spyro Adventure". It allowed
   Spyro to breathe fire, ice and electricity. This is the first game not
   to feature a lives system.
   [106]Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy 2004 [107]Game Boy Advance
   [108]Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy was the fourth and final
   Executive Spyro game on the Game Boy Advance. It was a crossover game
   between Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot. In this game, you travel
   through Crash's Universe in a side-scroller, rather than the
   traditional top-down view.
   [109]Spyro: A Hero's Tail 2004 [110]PlayStation 2, [111]Xbox,
   [112]Nintendo Gamecube [113]Spyro: A Hero's Tail is the fifth
   installment in the Spyro series, is available for the PlayStation 2,
   [114]Xbox and GameCube, and was created by [115]Eurocom Entertainment
   Software. Red, a former Dragon Elder, sent Gnasty Gnorc to the Dragon
   Realms to plant Dark Gems - structures that flood the world with evil
   energy. Spyro travels across the Dragon Realms, destroy all the Dark
   Gems and defeat Red and his army.
   [116]Spyro: Shadow Legacy 2005 [117]Nintendo DS [118]Spyro: Shadow
   Legacy added RPG elements to the series, as well as a [119]parallel
   Shadow Realm of each of the individual [120]realms of [121]the Dragon
   Kingdom, [122]Avalar, and [123]the Forgotten Realms.
   [124]The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning 2006 [125]PlayStation 2,
   [126]Xbox, [127]Nintendo Gamecube, [128]Game Boy Advance, [129]Nintendo
   DS [130]The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning marked the third title to
   be released on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube and the second on the
   Xbox, released in [131]Autumn 2006 and developed by [132]Krome Studios.
   Portrayed as a reboot to the series, Spyro is sent on a quest to find
   the captured Guardian dragons so the Dark Master does not return from
   his prison. An evil dragoness named Cynder uses her dark minions to
   harness the power of the four Guardian dragons (fire, electricity, ice,
   and earth) in order to open the Dark Master's prison, bringing terror
   throughout the lands. The cast includes [133]Elijah Wood as Spyro,
   [134]David Spade as Sparx, [135]Gary Oldman as Ignitus, and [136]Cree
   Summer as Cynder.

   Although it was first advertised as a prequel to the first Spyro game,
   this game is in fact a [137]reboot to the series, starting off from
   scratch and having nothing to do with the previous games.

   The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning has received average, but mostly
   decent reviews and ratings from critics, often in agreement as being a
   good start for the trilogy, but open for improvement on the future
   installments as well.
   [138]The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night 2007 [139]Playstation 2,
   [140]Game Boy Advance, [141]Nintendo DS, [142]Wii [143]The Legend of
   Spyro: The Eternal Night was a sequel to A New Beginning, was released
   on October 2007 for the PlayStation 2 and [144]Wii consoles and was
   once again developed by Krome Studios. In this game, the Ape King Gaul
   planned to free the Dark Master from the Well of Souls on the Night of
   Eternal Darkness, and Spyro - having faced several visions of the
   threat - embarked on a journey to stop him. Elijah Wood and Gary Oldman
   reprised their roles for the game, with [145]Billy West taking over the
   role for Sparx, and [146]Mae Whitman taking over the role for Cynder.

   The Eternal Night received less acclaim than its predecessor, usually
   in part to its difficulty, controls and usual linear setup. Regardless,
   its sales warranted for continuation, but also improvement of the
   trilogy.
   [147]The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon 2008 [148]PlayStation 2,
   [149]PlayStation 3, [150]Xbox 360, [151]Wii, [152]Nintendo DS [153]The
   Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon is the third and final installment
   in The Legend of Spyro trilogy, as well as the tenth anniversary game
   of the series. It was released on October, 2008 for the Xbox 360, Wii,
   PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 for North America, and was devolped by
   Etranges Libellules. In the game, Spyro and Cynder awaken in the
   future, and set out to stop Malefor, the Dark Master, from spreading
   his evil across the world. Unlike previous Spyro games, this game
   features the ability to switch between Spyro and Cynder at any time.
   There is also a two player mode, with two players either playing as
   Spyro and Cynder simultaneously. Along with this new freedom comes
   "Free Flight," which allows Spyro and Cynder to fly at any time. Once
   again, Elijah Wood and Gary Oldman reprise their roles while Billy West
   is replaced as the voice of Sparx by [154]Wayne Brady, [155]Christina
   Ricci replaces Mae Whitman as the voice of Cynder, and [156]Blair
   Underwood voices Hunter of Avalar. [157]Mark Hamill does the voice for
   Malefor, the Dark Master.

[[197]edit] The Legend of Spyro Trilogy characters

     * Spyro the Dragon is a purple dragon that prophecies say will direct
       the fate of his era. He is the primary protagonist in The Legend of
       Spyro. He is compassionate for others and always willing to help.
     * Cynder was originally a large, powerful black dragon, who serves as
       the primary antagonist in The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning.
       Corrupted by Malefor, she is fully grown despite being the same age
       as Spyro. After being defeated, she returns to her normal size and
       becomes Spyro's companion. At the end of Dawn of the Dragon she
       admits that she loves Spyro.
     * Sparx is Spyro's foster brother. Sparx serves primarily as a
       traveling companion and the comic relief character.
     * Malefor, also known as The Dark Master , is the main villain of the
       series. Malefor was said to be the first purple dragon ever to be
       born, but he later says that there were many before him. Being a
       purple dragon, he quickly learned to use all the breaths despite
       not being a dragon of those types. He developed a belief that the
       role of the purple dragons is to resurrect an ancient monster
       called The Destroyer and bring about the end of the world.
       Realizing that he was corrupt, The Ancients banished him, and his
       own monstrous power brought about his first downfall. The ruins of
       his first fortress became known as the Mountain of Malefor, or the
       Well of Souls, where the souls of evil beings gravitate towards. He
       was accidentally set free by Cynder and Spyro and set about
       continuing his quest, and almost succeeded, but was defeated by
       Spyro and Cynder and sealed away forever by the spirits of The
       Ancients.
     * The Chronicler is a dragon who is over 1,000 years old with
       [198]telekinesis. He knows the past, present, and pieces of the
       future of every dragon ever born. He helps Spyro reawaken his
       powers through a series of dreams and visions. Characters speculate
       that he might be blind.
     * Cyril is a blue dragon and a master of ice. He is a wise but proud
       dragon.
     * Flash and Nina are the biological parents of Sparx and adoptive
       parents of Spyro. They find Spyro's egg, which hatches the same day
       as Sparx's egg, and raise Spyro as their adopted son.
     * Gaul is the Ape King, who plans to resurrect Malefor in [199]The
       Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night in order to obtain revenge on
       the dragons. He is killed by Spyro, and his minions are cursed by
       Malefor.
     * Hunter is a cheetah warrior who lives in a valley called Avalar. He
       has heard of Spyro and hopes that one day they will meet. He
       managed to save Spyro, Sparx, and Cynder from the catacombs.
     * Ignitus is a redish-orange dragon, and a master of fire, who is the
       first Guardian Spyro encounters and becomes very close to him. At
       the end of DotD, he becomes the new age's Chronicler. Spyro looks
       to him as a father-figure.
     * Mole-Yair is the leader of the Manweersmalls, a rodent-like race
       that takes refuge underground in Munitions Forge, to hide from the
       volcano, Mt. Boyzitbig. He is mainly seen as a guiding figure,
       instructing Spyro to save his people and his brother, Exhumor, in
       exchange for information on Terrador's location.
     * Terrador is a battle-scarred warrior, and a master of Earth.
       Terrador is the most [200]militant guardian. Dedicated and focused
       on practical art of battle, he is straight forward and agenda-less.
       He judges everyone, Spyro included, not by looks, color, or
       species, but how well they fight.
     * Volteer is a yellow dragon of electricity. He is very smart, but he
       has a habit of talking too much.

[[201]edit] Items

     * Gems are the hoard of dragons and often used as currency. In many
       of the Spyro games, there were a set number of gems per level, and
       these were counted towards the player's overall percentage of game
       completion. In the older games they would be used to pay the
       character Moneybags who would make later parts of the level
       accessible. However, ever since A Hero's Tail, this has no longer
       the case: gems could be collected by defeating enemies, and used to
       purchase consumable power-up items from shops. In the Legend of
       Spyro series, the gems are used as powerups themselves, eliminating
       "Fodder" from the game.

     * Special collectibles Most of the games involve finding special
       items by completing quests and searching levels. They are used to
       reach new levels but become harder to obtain as the games progress.
       These special items are unique to each game and include; the orbs
       from "Ripto's Rage", the FireFlys in "Season of Flame", and the
       light gems in "A Hero's Tail".

     * Orbs appeared in Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage. These were obtained from
       side missions such as riding a manta ray or destroying special
       boxes. There were 64 in total in the entire game. They were used to
       access new levels and bosses. If you collected all of the orbs and
       all of the gems, you unlocked the permanent superflame powerup.

     * Dragon Eggs have appeared in several of the Spyro games. Depending
       on the game, collecting enough Dragon Eggs can unlock secrets or
       allow passage to consecutive worlds. Some Dragon Eggs may be found
       lying on the ground or hovering in the air; some could be obtained
       by completing specific challenges; some could be recovered from
       locked treasure chests; other Dragon Eggs are in the possession of
       thieves, who must be chased down and attacked to recover the egg.
       Collecting these eggs was the main objective in Year of the Dragon.

     * Fodder and Butterflies were used as health [202]power-ups in the
       original canon. Fodder were wild, yet harmless, animals that could
       be killed by breathing flame on them or charging into them. When it
       is killed, it releases a butterfly that Sparx will eat and one
       piece of health is restored. In later games, some special
       butterflies could give you a life. These special butterflies would
       often appear in difficult to reach jars, which wouldn't reappear
       until you left the world.

     * Lives are special units of health;if you lose Sparx and take
       another hit you will lose a life and go back to the last save point
       you were at. In the first Spyro game, lives were earned by
       collecting dragon statues and orbs, while in later games you could
       get lives from rare butterflies. Since the release of Attack of the
       Rhynocs, the lives concept was discarded entirely. In The Legend of
       Spyro series, Spyro has a separate health bar.

     * Portals are special doors that appeared in the first five games.
       When Spyro would walk into these portals he would be transported to
       another world. In Spyro: Ripto's Rage and Spyro: Year of the Dragon
       they were treated like machines; needing sources of power. In
       Spyro: Ripto's Rage it was shown that portals could be altered to
       change the location that other portals would link to. It has been
       shown that portals can be both one and two way. Some portals would
       simply leave Spyro in the middle of a level, while other portals
       would eject him out of another portal.

[[203]edit] Reception

   The first three games had received extremely high critical appraise.
   However, after Insomniac stopped producing the games the scores dropped
   significantly.The games which had once scored 8.3/10 on Gamespot now
   scored 2.3/10 on the same site. It is felt that the main fault for this
   is due to the lack of continuity in the games between the
   PS2/Xbox/Gamecube versions with the GBA games, the lack of originality
   in the new games and how they seemed little changed from PS games in
   terms of gameplay and changing the voice actors and music. However the
   Legend series has tried to change this fairly well. ^[204][8]^[205][9]

[[206]edit] Music

[[207]edit] Stewart Copeland

   [208]Stewart Copeland, the [209]drummer of the band [210]The Police, is
   credited with composing the [211]soundtracks for the first three Spyro
   games as well as Enter the Dragonfly. The score for Spyro the Dragon
   was given high praise for its originality, portraying
   oriental/fantasy-like themes for the Dragon Worlds.

   Copeland made music for each world in the games as well as music
   devoted to each level, giving them each their own feel according to the
   natural surroundings, architecture and inhabitants of the place. For
   example, in Spyro the Dragon the Artisans' world of shepherds, sheep,
   medieval towers and endless green hills has an oriental-sounding
   mixture of bells and drums where as the Beast Makers' midnight swamp
   has a solid rhythm overlaid with the melancholy calls of an owl.
   Ambient music features in Spyro 2 such as in Autumn Plains. The music
   features a range of percussion instruments, a characterful organ and
   harpsichord samples. [212]Ted Price, the head of [213]Insomniac Games
   believed Copeland's work for Spyro: Year of the Dragon, which he
   co-wrote with [214]Ryan Beveridge, was some of his best to date. It is
   the stage for all kinds of sounds, including strange vocals and exotic
   instruments in styles from all over the world. The music has never been
   released on CD.

   The music has been compared to that of [215]Mutato Muzika's score of
   the original [216]Naughty Dog [217]Crash Bandicoot games.

[[218]edit] Rebecca Knuebuhl and Gabriel Mann

   Knuebuhl and Mann have composed and put together many of the music
   pieces for each level of The Legend of Spyro series. Most music tracks
   have a more opera feeling to it. They have also performed songs with
   lyrics which are based on the protagonist's bonds with his closest
   allies such as "This Broken Soul" and "Guide You Home (I Will Die For
   You)".
