   Union.Marathwada is a division of Maharashtra state in India.

   Indian and on the reorganization of the state in 1956 the Marathwada
   became a part of bilingual state of Bombay and from 1st May 1960
   Marathwada has been a part of the state of Maharashtra.

   Marathwada can well be described as the home of Arts, Culture and
   Literature. The Caves of Ajanta and Ellora, which lie in this region,
   attract scholars artist, Students and visitors from distant part of the
   world Marathwada region has a rich literary and culture heritage. The
   Well-known poets, writers, saints and philosophers of Maharashtra
   Belong to this region. Dnyaneshwar, Namdeo, Ekanath, Dasopant and
   Ramdas are notable names. They have been responsible for the epithet
   cradle of Marathi Literature, applied to this region. SIRAJ a great
   poet of early Urdu Literature and WALI known as fathers of Modern Urdu
   Poetry were born here and lived here in the city of Aurangabad. A year
   before the establishment of the Marathwada University for the
   population of approximately 53 lakhs in 1957, there ware around 3686
   primary schools, 231 middle schools and 95 high schools in Marathwada.
   There wear one polytechnic and one technical school at Aurangabad until
   1950; there was one intermediate college run by the Osmania University
   at Aurangabad. Two non-government college were started one at
   Aurangabad and one at Nanded in 1950. Five more colleges came into

   and a college of agriculture at Parbhani and a college of Science at
   Mominabad. The number of students passing the H.S.C. examination had
   increased form 1,065 in 1957-58.

   The Demand For A University For Marathwada

   For a longer period Marathwada was educationally neglected. There ware
   only nine intermediate college and ninety-five high schools for a total
   population 5,300,000 in Marathwada region before 1st November 1958.
   Moreover all the college were affiliated to the Osmania University,
   Hyderabad. The Student of Aurangabad (Marathwada) had to go to the
   Osmania University of Hyderabad for further studies. There were no
   facilities for post graduate and research students. It was difficult
   for a student of average means form the distinct to avail of the
   educational facilities in Hyderabad.Hence there was a demand form the
   people of Marathwada region for having an independent University in
   Marathwada Region increased when the number of students had to go all
   the way to Hyderabad for their education.After merging of the Marathi
   speaking areas of Hyderabad in the old state of Bombay the people of
   Marathwada felt free to give expression to their aspiration, and began
   to voice their demand for the establishment of University for the
   region. Educational and other associations urged the need for a
   separate University for Marathwada for the educational cultural and
   general development of the region.

   In the Osmania University, the medium of instruction was Urdu as it was
   established in the Nizam State After political change in 1947, the
   independence of India the regional language were adopted as medium of
   Secondary Level Education. Therefore, It was necessary to teach the
   higher education in regional language because of this problem people
   form Marathwada region demanded a new University for the educational as
   well as Socio Economical development.

   The Movement

   Samiti in which emphasis was given on Separate University for the
   purpose of cultural and Educational activities two Convention of
   members of Parliament and of the State Legislature in 1955-1956
   strongly represented the need for a University on 29th July 1956 a
   delegation of members of Parliament and of the state Legislature an
   educationists in Marathwada Submitted memorandum to the Chief Minister
   of Hyderabad State making of similar demand the Government of Hyderabad
   appointed a committee. The committee submitted its report an on 27th
   October 1956 the Council of Ministers recorded its view that it was
   strongly of the opinion that a separate University for Marathwada area
   should be established. Shri Y.B. Chavan who was Chief Minister of
   Bombay then toured Marathwada in January 1957 wherever he went and
   received representations form the local bodies, students and citizens,
   pressing the demand for a University for Marathwada.

   In response to the educational demand of Marathwada region on 27th
   April 1957 the government of Marathwada published its resolution
   appointing a Committee to report on the question of establishment of a
   separate University for the Marathwada area under the chairmanship of
   the Late Justice S.M. Paluitkar Ex chief Justice of the Hyderabad High
   court and later judge of Bombay High court. The committee was composed

   Marathwada area with the teaching and affiliating functions, which
   should pay special attention to need of the region. The committee
   submitted its report on the 1st December 1957. Following the
   recommendations of the committee, government took immediate steps to
   draft the necessary legislation and the Marathwada University Act

   The 23rd August 1958 will be inscribed in golden letters in the annals
   of the history of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, as
   it was on this day that Shri. Late Jawaharlal Nehru, prime minister of
   India, inaugurated the University in the presence of the large &
   distinguished gathering at Aurangabad on the premises of the temporary

   present at the inauguration. More than 3,000 including students and
   teachers the leading citizens of Aurangabad and other important cities
   of Marathwada were present at the gathering.

   Location:

   The places were suggested for the seat of the University via
   Aurangabad, Nanded & Mominabad. The seat for the University was to be
   at Aurangabad.The reasons in favor of locating the University at
   Aurangabad are very cogent. Aurangabad has for a long time been an
   important cultural center of Marathwada.Deogiri (Daulatabad), the
   capital of Yadavas is only 8 miles (13 km) from it, while the world
   famous Ellora caves, are 4 miles (6.4 km) further, and the Ajanta caves
   whose frescoes have won the admiration of the world are just 64 miles
   (103 km) from it.Paithan, the ancient Pratisthan of Eknath and
   Maharubhav fame, is 34 mils away. Aurangabad was a division center
   during the Hyderabad regime.Hence the committee strongly recommended
   that the seat of the University is located at Aurangabad.

   University Buildings

   The Government of Bombay lent the two-storied building belonging to the
   middle school situated in Aurangpura (New Zilla Parishad) with its
   annexes. Until such time as the University is able to construct its own
   buildings on the University campus. It was proposed to utilize the
   existing building for the office. The meeting of the University bodies,
   for accommodating the University departments and library and for
   holding some of the post graduates classes.

   In all the eight colleges in Marathwada were affiliated to the Osmania
   University, when the Marathwada University was established in June-1958
   one more college at Jalna was affiliated in the month of July of the
   same year.The affiliation of nine colleges with the Osmania University
   terminated on October 31, 1958. The nine colleges are as follows:

   Marathwada, Aurangabad, Paithan, Pratishthan, Daulatabad, Deogiri,
   Ajanta, Shalivahana, Satawahana, Shivaji etc.

   The University has to serve the need of the whole Marathwada region
   with a common historical and cultural. The name of city however
   illustrious cannot be exercise the same spell upon the imagination of
   the Marathwada People. The name of the University must be such that it
   will make an emotional appeal to the heart and minds of the people. The
   name Marathwada has that advantage, therefore it was named as
   Marathwada University on 14th January 1994 the University was renamed
   Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University to pay homage to work done
   by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar for the educational development of Marathwada
   region.The University Campus covers an area of more then 650 Acres of

   and a quarter in length. The hills provide a picturesque background
   with silvery streak of small cascades during the rain. The famous
   Aurangabad Caves embedded in the Campus. The Suneri Mahal (Golden
   Palace) an ancient monument at the foot of the hills, is at the Centre
   of the Campus. The Bibi Ka Makabara helps to break the monotony of
   landscape to the north cast of the campus.

   The design adopted for the coat of arms bears the following emblems:-

   (1)An Ajanta Arch with a base in which the above - mentioned motto is
   inscribed. The arch is a symbol of the glory of the art of painting and
   sculpture which reached their acme in the Ajanta Caves, a glory that
   has survived, undimmed and unrivalled, through centuries, and thousand
   of admiring visitors to this day from the most distant part of the
   world.
