   Dorothy Hackett McGuire ([14]June 14, [15]1916 [16]September 13,
   [17]2001) was an [18]Academy Award-nominated [19]American actress.

[[20]edit] Career

   Born in [21]Omaha, Nebraska, she began her acting career on the stage
   in numerous summer stock productions. Eventually, she succeeded on
   [22]Broadway, first appearing as an understudy to [23]Martha Scott in
   [24]Our Town, and subsequently starring in the domestic comedy,
   Claudia.

   Brought to Hollywood by producer [25]David O. Selznick on the strength
   of her stage performance, McGuire starred in her first film, a movie
   adaptation of her Broadway success, Claudia, and portrayed the
   character of a child bride who almost destroys her [26]marriage through
   her selfishness. Her inaugural screen performance was popular with both
   the public and critics alike and was the catalyst for not only a
   sequel, Claudia and David (both movies co-starring [27]Robert Young),
   but also for numerous other film roles.

   McGuire had a lengthy Hollywood career. Her versatility served her well
   in taut melodramas, such as [28]The Spiral Staircase and Make Haste to
   Live, as well as in light, frothy comedies, such as Mother Didn't Tell
   Me and [29]Mister 880. By 1943, at the age of 27, she was already
   playing mother roles, in such movies as [30]A Tree Grows In Brooklyn.
   She was nominated for the [31]Academy Award for Best Actress in 1947
   for [32]Gentleman's Agreement. Other notable films include [33]Three
   Coins in the Fountain, [34]Friendly Persuasion, [35]Old Yeller,
   [36]Swiss Family Robinson, and [37]The Greatest Story Ever Told.

   Married to [38]Life Magazine photographer John Swope for more than 35
   years, she had a son, photographer Mark Swope, and a daughter Topo
   (born 1948), who also became an actress. McGuire died of [39]cardiac
   arrest following a brief illness at the age of 85 in 2001.

   McGuire has a star on the [40]Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6933 Hollywood
   Blvd.

   McGuire is an alumna of private liberal arts college, [41]Pine Manor
   College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. McGuire often contributed her
   time and talent to the acting program.

   Controversy Omission by the Academy at 2002 Oscars. In April of 2002,
   Dorothy's family was hurt and disappointed after Dorothy's name was
   unwittingly omitted by the Motion Picture Academy from the "In
   Memoriam" tribute of the March 2002 telecast. The demure, classy
   Dorothy, who had died within the calendar year and was nominated once
   for an Oscar for Gentleman's Agreement (1947), was one of those
   talented stars who avoided the sensationalism of stardom. The Academy
   explained that it was NOT an oversight or a slight, but that they have
   room only for 15-20 names in a single tribute. However, left
   unexplained was why they managed to include lesser film personalities
   such as Aaliyah.
