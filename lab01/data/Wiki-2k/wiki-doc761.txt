   East Tennessee State University (ETSU) is an accredited [39]American
   [40]university, founded October 2, 1911 and located in [41]Johnson
   City, [42]Tennessee. It is part of the [43]Tennessee Board of Regents
   system of colleges and universities. ETSU has small off-campus centers
   in nearby [44]Kingsport, [45]Bristol, [46]Elizabethton, and
   [47]Greeneville, Tennessee.

   Graduate programs include a fully accredited [48]medical school, the
   [49]Quillen College of Medicine, named in honor of U.S. Congressman
   [50]James H. Quillen who successfully fought for its creation in the
   1970s. In 2005 a College of Pharmacy was approved which further
   augmented the medical specialties at ETSU. Classes in the ETSU College
   of Pharmacy began in January 2007. The university is listed by [51]The
   Princeton Review in their 2007 edition of Americas Best Value Colleges.
   ETSU has the only master's degree in the United States in storytelling.

[[73]edit] History

   ETSU was founded as East Tennessee State [74]Normal School, to educate
   teachers; the K-12 training school, called University School, operates
   to this day. East Tennessee State officially became a college in 1925
   when it changed its name to East Tennessee State Teachers College,
   subsequently gaining accreditation from the [75]Southern Association of
   Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1927. In 1943, East Tennessee State
   Teacher's College was expanded into a college with a range of
   [76]liberal arts offerings, becoming East Tennessee State College. The
   college became a [77]University in 1963, adopting the name it holds
   today.^[78][5]

[[80]edit] Athletics

   East Tennessee State Buccaneers logo

   ETSU collegiate athletic teams, [81]nicknamed Buccaneers, presently
   compete in the [82]NCAA [83]Division I [84]Atlantic Sun Conference. In
   the 2006-07 year, ETSU won both of the conference's men and women's
   [85]All-Sport trophies, winning seven team titles. They repeated as the
   overall and men's All-Sport champions in 2007-08 with three more team
   titles.^[86][6]

   Current men's sports at ETSU are [87]baseball, [88]basketball,
   [89]cross country, [90]golf, [91]soccer, [92]tennis and [93]track and
   field. Women's sports are basketball, cross country, golf, soccer,
   [94]softball, tennis, track and field and [95]volleyball. Men's soccer
   competed at the club level in the fall of 2007, before entering NCAA
   and Atlantic Sun competition as a scholarship program in the 2008
   season.^[96][7] A new on-campus soccer field, the Summers-Taylor field,
   opened in Fall 2007. In the 2007-08 season, the women's basketball team
   made their first trip to the NCAA tournament, but they lost in their
   opening game by 12 points to the Oklahoma State Cowgirls.

[[97]edit] Football

   The 2005 move of the Buccaneers from the [98]Southern Conference to the
   Atlantic Sun was an direct result of ETSU President Stanton's decision,
   following the 1999 ETSU Athletic Task Force recommendations, to drop
   the ETSU football program after the 2003 season, in response to budget
   limitations imposed by the state legislature. The football program was
   posting close to $1 million in financial losses each year between
   1999-2003.^[99][8]

   The "[100]Mini Dome", the largest building on the ETSU campus, has
   served as an U.S. indoor arena venue for [101]college football and
   [102]track and field competitions. The Mini Dome has hosted many
   non-athletic events which could not be housed in an indoor setting on
   most American college campuses.

[[103]edit] Proposed student athletic fee increase

   ETSU President Stanton announced on December 22, 2006 that the ETSU
   administration is now supporting the return of [104]the ETSU NCAA
   Division I FCS football program to the university, after accepting the
   recent ETSU Football Task Force report calling for increased student
   athletic fees to both restore the ETSU football program and additional
   funding for equivalent female athletic programs in order to meet U.S.
   federal Title IX gender equity requirements. Dr. Stanton has also
   stated that ETSU will "...need $4 million to $5 million" collected each
   year from of a combination students fees and private contributors to
   "...get it all done."^[105][9]

   Both the ETSU student body (by a referendum vote) and the
   [106]Tennessee Board of Regents would have needed to approve Dr.
   Stanton's proposal to increase ETSU student athletic fees for funding a
   new football program before competing in the 2010 season.^[107][10]

   Dr. Stanton also stated that ETSU generates approximately $500,000 of
   revenue from every $25 student athletic fees collected each semester at
   ETSU (i.e.: a conservative estimate of student fees fully funding ETSU
   football at the $5 million dollar level would amount to an additional
   $250 in ETSU student athletic fees each year).^[108][9] During the last
   year of the football program in 2003, ETSU was only able to raise
   $127,000 (of the minimum $1.5 million needed) in private contributions
   toward the operating costs that will associated with the ETSU football
   program (excluding approximately $15 million dollars for a new 10,000
   seat stadium).^[109][8]

   On April 10-11, 2007 the football referendum failed by a vote of
   59%-41%, with about 3,500 students voting. Dr. Paul Stanton released a
   statement following the vote, saying the issue of football was dead for
   the immediate future.^[110][11]^[111][12]

[[112]edit] Greek Life

   There are several Greek organizations offered at East Tennessee State
   University. Greek Life provides occasions for social interaction and
   intramural participation between young men and women.^[113][13] The
   Interfraternity Council offers young men seven options of Fraternities:
   [114]Lambda Chi Alpha, [115]Sigma Alpha Epsilon, [116]Sigma Nu,
   [117]Sigma Phi Epsilon, [118]Sigma Chi, [119]Kappa Sigma, and [120]Pi
   Kappa Alpha.^[121][13] The Panhellenic Council offers young women four
   options of Sororities: [122]Alpha Delta Pi, [123]Alpha Xi Delta,
   [124]Kappa Delta, and [125]Sigma Kappa.^[126][13]

[[127]edit] Tobacco Policy and Campus Reaction

   All ETSU campuses and grounds were declared tobacco-free as of August
   11 2008.^[128][14]^[129][15]

   Despite the ban and the offer of a cessation program^[130][16], many
   members of the campus community continue to use tobacco. Several signs
   regarding the tobacco policy have been removed and defaced.^[131][17]
   Current policy^[132][18] does not allow fines against those in
   violation of the ban. This and several other aspects of the policy have
   been criticised by students.^[133][19]^[134][20]

   In April of 2008, current Student Government Association President T.J.
   Mitchell stated his willingness to "strive for a partial repeal on the
   smoking ban" and his hope for "designated smoking areas on
   campus".^[135][21] However, on September 30, 2008, a Student Government
   Association vote to allow for smoking "huts" failed to pass
   (8-19).^[136][22]
