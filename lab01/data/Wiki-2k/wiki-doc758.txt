   The Brooklyn Bridge, one of the oldest [27]suspension bridges in the
   [28]United States, stretches 5,989 feet (1825 m)^[29][1] over the
   [30]East River, connecting the [31]New York City [32]boroughs of
   [33]Manhattan and [34]Brooklyn (on [35]Long Island). Upon completion,
   it was the [36]longest suspension bridge in the world, the first
   steel-wire suspension bridge, and the first bridge to connect to Long
   Island. Originally referred to as the New York and Brooklyn Bridge, it
   was dubbed the Brooklyn Bridge in an 1867 letter to the editor of the
   [37]Brooklyn Daily Eagle,^[38][2] and formally so named by the city
   government in 1915. Since its opening, it has become an iconic part of
   the New York [39]skyline. It was designated a [40]National Historic
   Landmark in 1964.^[41][3]^[42][4]^[43][5]

[[60]edit] Construction

   Plan of one tower for the Brooklyn Bridge, 1867
   Currier & Ives print (1877)

   Construction began on January 3, 1870. The Brooklyn Bridge was
   completed thirteen years later and was opened for use on May 24, 1883.
   The opening ceremony was attended by several thousand people and many
   ships were present in the East Bay for the occasion. President
   [61]Chester Arthur and [62]New York Mayor [63]Franklin Edson crossed
   the bridge to celebratory cannon fire and were greeted by Brooklyn
   Mayor [64]Seth Low when they reached the Brooklyn-side tower. Arthur
   shook hands with [65]Washington Roebling, who, along with his father
   [66]John Roebling, designed and built the bridge. Further festivity
   included the performance of a band, gunfire from ships, and a fireworks
   display.^[67][6]

   On that first day, a total of 1,800 vehicles and 150,300 people crossed
   what was then the only land passage between Manhattan and Long Island.
   The bridge's main span over the East River is 1,595 feet 6 inches
   (486.3 m). The bridge cost $15.5 million to build and approximately 27
   people died during its construction.^[68][7]

   One week after the opening, on May 30, 1883, a rumor that the Bridge
   was going to collapse caused a stampede, which crushed and killed
   twelve people.^[69][8] On May 17, 1884, P. T. Barnum helped to squelch
   doubts about the bridge's stabilitywhile publicizing his famous
   circuswhen one of his most famous attractions, [70]Jumbo, led a parade
   of 21 elephants over the Brooklyn
   Bridge.^[71][9]^[72][10]^[73][11]^[74][12]

   At the time it opened, it was the longest suspension bridge in the
   world 50% longer than any previously built and it has become a
   treasured landmark. For several years the towers were the tallest
   structures in the Western Hemisphere. Since the 1980s, it has been
   floodlit at night to highlight its architectural features. The towers
   are built of limestone, granite, and [75]Rosendale cement. Their
   architectural style is [76]neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed
   arches above the passageways through the stone towers.

   The bridge was designed by [77]German-born [78]John Augustus Roebling
   in [79]Trenton, New Jersey. Roebling had earlier designed and
   constructed other suspension bridges, such as [80]Roebling's Delaware
   Aqueduct in [81]Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, the [82]John A. Roebling
   Suspension Bridge in [83]Cincinnati, Ohio and the [84]Waco Suspension
   Bridge in [85]Waco, Texas, that served as the engineering prototypes
   for the final design.

   During surveying for the East River Bridge project, Roebling's foot was
   badly injured by a ferry, pinning it against a pylon; within a few
   weeks, he died of [86]tetanus. His son, [87]Washington, succeeded him,
   but in 1872 was stricken with [88]caisson disease ([89]decompression
   sickness, commonly known as "the bends"), due to working in compressed
   air in caissons.^[90][13] The occurrence of the disease in the caisson
   workers caused him to halt construction of the Manhattan side of the
   tower 30 feet (10 m) short of bedrock when soil tests underneath the
   caisson found bedrock to be even deeper than expected. Today, the
   Manhattan tower rests only on sand.^[91][14] Washington's wife,
   [92]Emily Warren Roebling, became his aide, learning engineering and
   communicating his wishes to the on-site assistants. When the bridge
   opened, she was the first person to cross it. Washington Roebling
   rarely visited the site again.

   trains, ca. 1905

   At the time the bridge was built, the [94]aerodynamics of bridge
   building had not been worked out. Bridges were not tested in [95]wind
   tunnels until the 1950s well after the collapse of the original
   [96]Tacoma Narrows Bridge (Galloping Gertie) in 1940. It is therefore
   fortunate that the open truss structure supporting the deck is by its
   nature less subject to aerodynamic problems. Roebling designed a bridge
   and truss system that was six times as strong as he thought it needed
   to be. Because of this, the Brooklyn Bridge is still standing when many
   of the bridges built around the same time have vanished into history
   and been replaced. This is also in spite of the substitution of
   inferior quality wire in the cabling supplied by the contractor [97]J.
   Lloyd Haigh by the time it was discovered, it was too late to replace
   the cabling that had already been constructed. Roebling determined that
   the poorer wire would leave the bridge four rather than six times as
   strong as necessary, so it was eventually allowed to stand, with the
   addition of 250 cables. Diagonal cables were installed from the towers
   to the deck, intended to stiffen the bridge. They turned out to be
   unnecessary, but were kept for their distinctive beauty.

   After the collapse of the [98]I-35W highway bridge in the city of
   Minneapolis, increased public attention has been brought to bear on the
   condition of bridges across the US, and it has been reported that the
   Brooklyn Bridge approach ramps received a rating of "poor" at its last
   inspection.^[99][15] According to a NYC Department of Transportation
   spokesman, "The poor rating it received does not mean it is unsafe.
   Poor means there are some components that have to be rehabilitated. A
   $725 million project to replace the approaches and repaint the bridge
   is scheduled to begin in 2009.^[100][16]

   The construction of the Brooklyn Bridge is detailed in the 1972 book
   The Great Bridge by [101]David McCullough^[102][17] and [103]Brooklyn
   Bridge (1981), the first [104]PBS documentary film ever made by
   [105]Ken Burns.^[106][18] Burns drew heavily on McCullough's book for
   the film and used him as narrator.^[107][19] It is also described in
   [108]Seven Wonders of the Industrial World, a BBC docudrama series with
   accompanying book.

[[109]edit] First jumper

   The first person to jump from the bridge was Robert E. Odlum on May 19,
   1885. Robert, a swimming teacher, made the jump in a costume bearing
   his initials.^[[110]citation needed] He survived the pre-announced
   jump, but died shortly thereafter from internal injuries.^[111][20]

[[122]edit] Later changes in use

   At various times, the bridge has carried horse-drawn and trolley
   traffic; at present, it has six lanes for motor vehicles, with a
   separate walkway along the centerline for [123]pedestrians and
   [124]bicycles. Due to the roadway's height (11 feet posted) and weight
   (6,000 lb posted) restrictions, commercial vehicles and buses are
   prohibited from using this bridge. The two inside traffic lanes once
   carried [125]elevated trains of the [126]BMT from [127]Brooklyn points
   to a terminal at [128]Park Row. [129]Streetcars ran on what are now the
   two center lanes (shared with other traffic) until the elevated lines
   stopped using the bridge in 1944, when they moved to the protected
   center tracks. In [130]1950 the streetcars also stopped running, and
   the bridge was rebuilt to carry six lanes of automobile traffic.

[[131]edit] 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shooting

          Main article: [132]Brooklyn Bridge Shooting

   On March 1, 1994, Lebanese-born [133]Rashid Baz opened fire on a van
   carrying members of the [134]Chabad-Lubavitch [135]Orthodox Jewish
   Movement, striking sixteen-year-old student [136]Ari Halberstam and
   three others traveling on the bridge. Halberstam died five days later
   from his wounds. Baz was apparently acting out of revenge for the
   [137]Hebron massacre of 29 Muslims by [138]Baruch Goldstein that had
   taken place days earlier on February 25, 1994. Baz was convicted of
   murder and sentenced to a 141-year prison term. After initially
   classifying the murder as one committed out of [139]road rage, the
   [140]Justice Department reclassified the case in 2000 as a terrorist
   attack. The entrance ramp to the bridge on the Manhattan side was named
   the Ari Halberstam Memorial Ramp in memory of the victim.^[141][22]

[[142]edit] The 2003 plot

   In 2003, truck driver [143]Iyman Faris was sentenced to about 20 years
   in prison for providing material support to [144]Al-Qaeda, after an
   earlier plot to destroy the bridge by cutting through its support wires
   with [145]blowtorches was thwarted through information the
   [146]National Security Agency uncovered through wiretapped phone
   conversations and interrogation of Al-Qaeda militant and mastermind on
   September 11, 2001 [147]Khalid Sheikh
   Mohammed.^[148][23]^[[149]citation needed]

[[150]edit] 2006 bunker discovery

   In 2006, a [151]Cold War era bunker was found by city workers near the
   East River shoreline of Manhattan's Lower East Side. The bunker, hidden
   within the masonry anchorage, still contained the emergency supplies
   that were being stored for a potential nuclear attack by the
   [152]Soviet Union.^[153][24]

[[154]edit] 125th Anniversary celebrations

   On May 24, 2008, festivities were held over the entire [155]Memorial
   Day week-end to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the opening of the
   Brooklyn Bridge.^[156][25]

[[157]edit] Pedestrian access

   Brooklyn Bridge at night
   Cross section diagram

   The Brooklyn Bridge is accessible from the Brooklyn entrances of
   Tillary/Adams Streets, Sands/Pearl Streets, and Exit 28B of the
   eastbound [158]Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. In Manhattan, motor cars can
   enter from either direction of the [159]FDR Drive, [160]Park Row,
   Chambers/Centre Streets, and Pearl/Frankfort Streets. Pedestrian access
   to the bridge from the Brooklyn side is from either Tillary/Adams
   Streets (in between the auto entrance/exit), or a staircase on Prospect
   St between Cadman Plaza East and West. In Manhattan, the pedestrian
   walkway is accessible from the end of Centre Street, or through the
   unpaid south staircase of [161]Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall [162]IRT
   subway station.

   The Brooklyn Bridge has a wide pedestrian walkway open to walkers and
   cyclists, in the center of the bridge and higher than the automobile
   lanes. While the bridge has always permitted the passage of pedestrians
   across its span, its role in allowing thousands to cross takes on a
   special importance in times of difficulty when usual means of crossing
   the East River have become unavailable.

   During transit [163]strikes by the [164]Transport Workers Union in 1980
   and 2005 the bridge was used by people commuting to work, with Mayors
   [165]Koch and [166]Bloomberg crossing the bridge as a gesture to the
   affected public.

   Following the [167]1965, [168]1977 and [169]2003 [170]Blackouts and
   most famously after the [171]September 11, 2001 attacks on the
   [172]World Trade Center, the bridge was used by people in Manhattan to
   leave the city after subway service was suspended. The massive numbers
   of people on the bridge could not have been anticipated by the original
   designer, yet John Roebling designed it with three separate systems
   managing even unanticipated structural stresses. The bridge has a
   suspension system, a diagonal stay system, and a stiffening truss.
   "Roebling himself famously said if anything happens to one of [his]
   systems, 'The bridge may sag, but it will not fall.'"^[173][26] The
   movement of large numbers of people on a bridge creates pedestrian
   oscillations or "sway" as the crowd lifts one foot after another, some
   falling inevitably in synchronized cadences. The natural sway motion of
   people walking causes small sideways oscillations in a bridge, which in
   turn cause people on the bridge to sway in step, increasing the
   amplitude of the bridge oscillations and continually reinforcing the
   effect. This high-density traffic causes a bridge to appear to move
   erratically or "to wobble" as happened at opening of the [174]London
   Millennium Footbridge in 2000.^[175][27]

[[176]edit] Cultural significance

   Contemporaries marveled at what technology was capable of and the
   bridge became a symbol of the optimism of the time. [177]John Perry
   Barlow wrote in the late 20th century of the "literal and genuinely
   religious leap of faith" embodied in the Brooklyn Bridge the Brooklyn
   Bridge required of its builders faith in their ability to control
   technology."^[178][28]

   References to "selling the Brooklyn Bridge" abound in American culture,
   sometimes as examples of rural gullibility but more often in connection
   with an idea that strains credulity. For example, "If you believe that,
   I have a wonderful bargain for you" References are often nowadays more
   oblique, such as "I could sell you some lovely riverside property in
   Brooklyn ... ". [179]George C. Parker and [180]William McCloundy are
   two early 20th-century con-men who had (allegedly) successfully
   perpetrated this scam on unwitting tourists.^[181][29]

   In his second book The Bridge, [182]Hart Crane begins with a poem
   entitled "Poem: To Brooklyn Bridge." The bridge was a source of
   inspiration for Crane and he owned different apartments specifically to
   have different views of the bridge.

   In the 1972 film [183]The Hot Rock, the Brooklyn Bridge was shown as a
   visual icon of New York City. The partially-finished [184]World Trade
   Center was also shown.
