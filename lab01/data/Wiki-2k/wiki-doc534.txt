[[30]edit] Brief History

   The Government of West Bengal established Durgapur Government College
   during the time of the genesis of Durgapur itself, an industrial town
   that was being built around a host of large and medium scale industries
   in the public and private sectors (and the ancillaries thereof) like
   the Durgapur Steel Plant, Alloy Steel Plant, Mining and Allied
   Machinery Corporation, Durgapur Projects Limited, Phillips Carbon Black
   Limited, etc. With the settlement of many thousands of industrial
   workers of all ranks in Durgapur, the need was felt for a Higher
   Education Institution that would offer to prospective students General
   Degree Courses and it was to meet this demand that the College was
   established.

[[31]edit] Vision & Mission

   The vision of the College is to play a definitive role in
   nation-building by instilling in students the zeal to serve the larger
   community by becoming dedicated professionals in their chosen fields,
   and its mission is to provide quality higher education that is informed
   with a sense of progressive and modern outlook to all its students.

[[32]edit] Objectives

   The goals and objectives of the College are to ensure that the students
   are provided with academic training of a high quality so that they are
   equipped with the skill sets required in todays professional sphere. As
   the institute also stresses upon the need to develop all-round
   faculties of the students, among its objectives is the promotion of
   extracurricular, cultural and sporting abilities of the students.

   Though the focus of the goals and objectives of the College is
   primarily on development of the intellectual potential of the students,
   other considerations are also addressed to. The College is a Government
   institution and as such it provides to the disadvantaged sections of
   the society all benefits due to them as stipulated by the Government
   which include seat reservation for members the Scheduled Castes,
   Scheduled Tribes and Physically Challenged as well as free-studentship
   (full and partial) for students coming from economically impoverished
   families. The College has full-fledged NCC and NSS units that
   periodically conduct programmes through which issues of Community and
   National Development, Ecology and Environment are dealt with. The
   College has a Career and Placement Training Cell that provides students
   with information regarding employment opportunities and assists them to
   develop soft skills required by the job-market. As the College is
   committed to provide to all its students and employees an environment
   that is gender equitable, it has a Cell for Gender Sensitization and
   Sexual Harassment Protection that works towards the achievement of such
   goals.

   ASSESSMENT AND ACCREDITATION BY NAAC

   What is NAAC? NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) is
   an autonomous institution established by the UGC (University Grants
   Commission) in 1994 at Bangalore. It is the mandate of NAAC to assess
   and evaluate every aspect of the functioning of higher education
   institutes in India and eventually grade the institutes on the basis of
   such assessment. The whole exercise is aimed at positive introspection
   and charts the path of future progress of the assessed institutes.

   Who were the assessors and when did they assess? Following a decision
   taken by the Department of Higher Education, Government of West Bengal,
   Durgapur Government College volunteered for assessment and
   accreditation and a three member Peer Team visited the institution to
   inspect it from 21 March to 23 March 2007. Prof Anjana Murthy, former
   Vice-Chancellor KSOU, Mysore was the Chairperson of the Peer Team while
   Prof S. Ramesh, Dean, Faculty of Commerce and Management, PG Centre,
   Mount Carmel College, Bangalore and Prof D. R. More, Principal, SSC
   Mahavidyalaya, Kolhapur and Member of the Senate, Shivaji University,
   Maharashtra were the Member-Coordinator and Member respectively.

   What about the Report? The Peer Team carefully studied the Self Study
   Report of the College (a detailed account of every facet of the working
   of the College that was submitted to NAAC months before the visit),
   went through all relevant documents and extensively interacted with all
   categories of stakeholders of the College including the Principal,
   Management, Teachers, Students, Non-teaching Staff, Parents and Alumni
   in order to prepare a comprehensive Report following the guidelines
   laid down by NAAC. Extracted below are some highlights of the report,
   the full text of which can be accessed at www.naacindia.org:

   Curricular Aspects: The College play(s) a definitive role in
   nation-building by instilling in the students the zeal to serve the
   larger community by becoming dedicated professionals in their chosen
   fields

   Teaching, Learning and Evaluation: The classroom events like debates,
   group discussions and interactive sessions used in the College relate
   the classroom teaching with real-life situationsThe departments on
   their own conduct tutorials and remedial coaching to weaker students is
   given Research, Consultancy and Extension: There are about 120 research
   papers published by the facultyIt is interesting to note that 32% of
   faculty have Ph.D. degreesThe Research Committeeencourages the faculty
   to undertake Minor ad major research projects, publish their papers and
   participate in seminars, conferences and workshops. There is thus a
   rich research culture in the College.

[[35]edit] Healthy Practices:

   The College has taken measures to create the institutional ambience for
   teaching and learning by enriching the academic pursuits.

[[36]edit] Overall Analysis and Concluding Remarks:

   The College has received more than Rs. 75,00,000 for various research
   projects. It has two patents to its creditThere is a good team work of
   the Governing Body, the principal, the Staff, the Students,
   Non-teaching Staff and alumniThey work in a fine balance of all
   stakeholdersgood faculty is indeed (the Colleges) real strength.

[[37]edit] All you wanted to know about the grade and grading system

   The assessment takes into consideration several distinct criteria (that
   represent every aspect of the functioning of the College) such as
   Curricular Aspects; Teaching, Learning and Evaluation; Research,
   Consultancy and Extension; Infrastructure and Learning Resources etc.
   The NAAC Peer Team (in consultation with NAAC officials) assigns scores
   as per its assessment (accomplished through scrutiny of documents, on
   the spot inspection and evaluative interaction) of the performance of
   College with respect to the several criteria. The scores that a College
   receives for all the criteria are added up to arrive at the
   Institutional Score and this score determines the grade. The
   Institutional Score of Durgapur Government College is 83.5 out of a
   maximum possible of 100 and thus the grade received is B + + (the score
   range for B + + is between 80 and 85).

[[38]edit] What next?

   Assessment and accreditation by NAAC is not a one time, one off
   phenomenon. It is a continual process of performance evaluation
   conducted internally and by external agencies to ensure commitment to
   quality. Thus, the accreditation received by the College is valid for
   five years and the College will have to present itself for
   re-assessment and re-accreditation at the end of the five-year period.
   The recommendations made by the Peer team will help the College chart
   its plans for further development. In fact, it is the prime concern of
   the IQAC (Internal Quality Assurance Cell, formed as stipulated by
   NAAC) to guide the College in the coming years towards achieving
   excellence in every aspect of its function
