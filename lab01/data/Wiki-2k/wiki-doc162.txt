[[40]edit] Song information

   The song is a mid-tempo [41]country pop song in which the narrator
   assures other females that they are beautiful just as they are. In the
   first verse, she addresses a fifteen-year old girl in tattered clothes,
   telling her "Now I know you'd give anything just to fit in / But your
   worth ain't on a price tag, it comes from within." The second verse
   addresses a [42]homecoming queen, whom the narrator tells to keep her
   innocence. The third verse is addressed to a wife, who was left by her
   husband, because he preferred a younger woman: "Let him go, let him
   fly, keep your head up, get on with your life."

[[43]edit] Critical reception

   The song has received mixed reception from music critics. Matt Bjorke,
   in his review of Kelllie Pickler for the Roughstock website, said,
   "'Dont You Know Youre Beautiful' is a song that speaks right to those
   little girls that admire Kellie. She wanted to give them something that
   they could listen to and know that everythings alright. While some
   traditionalists would say that the song isnt country, I firmly believe
   it is because it speaks of real life."^[44][4] Jennifer Webb of
   About.com reviewed the single favorably, saying, "'Dont You Know Youre
   Beautiful' is something that should be said to every little girl as
   well as grown up women. Don't depend on others to tell you how
   wonderful you are - that strength should come from within. Stay true to
   yourself and you can do anything you set your mind to." ^[45][5]

   Brady Vercher of The 9513, however, gave the song a "thumbs down"
   rating. He called the first verse "a bit cheesy and genericcommendable
   despite being underwhelming", but considered the rest of the song both
   lyrically deficient and derivative of [46]Martina McBride's 2003 single
   "[47]This One's for the Girls" (which also contains the lyric "you're
   beautiful the way you are" and was also co-written by Aimee Mayo).
   Vercher also described the rest of the song unfavorably:

   "But as the song progresseswe learn that the homecoming queen is
   beautiful as well. Who would have ever imagined a homecoming queen
   being beautiful? Then it somehow deviates from the message and gives
   advice to that little homecoming queen to keep her innocence. How that
   relates to beauty, who knows, but hey, dont you know youre beautiful.
   So, what exactly is the point of the song? To tell every girl that shes
   beautiful? If every girl is beautiful, then how meaningful is it to
   tell someone that they are beautiful?If we dont extrapolate the
   message, the song is pointless, and if we do extrapolate the message,
   its meaningless. Ultimately, coming from Kellie Pickler, its like a
   rich man telling the beggar that his soul is rich and thats better than
   all the money in the world as he passes him on the streetand somehow
   the rich man is still able to make money from the beggar."^[48][1]

[[49]edit] Music video

   Kellie Pickler having fun with some friends in the music video.

   A music video was released to accompany the song on July 31, 2008. It
   debuted at #1 on [50]GAC's Top 20 music countdown and held the top spot
   for 4 weeks, before falling to #2 behind [51]Carrie Underwood's
   "[52]Just a Dream".

   In the video, Pickler is seen singing with various women around her in
   different situations, including at the roller skating rink, a
   sleepover, and at a children's hospital. She also performs the song in
   a chair and sitting on high school athletic bleachers. Clips of a swim
   team, mechanic, and other girls are mixed in with these scenes
   throughout the video.

   The video is featured on the Deluxe Edition of Kellie's [53]second
   album.
