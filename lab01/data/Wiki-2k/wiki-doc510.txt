   Dune is a [31]1984 [32]science fiction film written and directed by
   [33]David Lynch, based on the 1965 [34]Frank Herbert [35]novel of the
   same name. The film stars [36]Kyle MacLachlan as [37]Paul Atreides, and
   includes an ensemble of well-known [38]American and [39]European actors
   in supporting roles, including [40]Sting, [41]Jose Ferrer, [42]Virginia
   Madsen, [43]Linda Hunt, [44]Patrick Stewart, [45]Max von Sydow, [46]Sin
   Phillips and [47]Jrgen Prochnow, among others. It was filmed at the
   [48]Churubusco Studios in [49]Mexico City and included a [50]soundtrack
   by the band [51]Toto. As in the novel, the central plot concerns a
   young man foretold in prophecy as the "[52]Kwisatz Haderach" who will
   protect the titular desert planet from the malevolent [53]House
   Harkonnen and save the universe from evil.

   After the success of the novel, attempts to adapt Dune for a film began
   as early as 1971. A lengthy process of [54]development hell followed
   throughout the 1970s, during which [55]Arthur P. Jacobs, [56]Alejandro
   Jodorowsky, and [57]Ridley Scott all tried to bring there vision to the
   screen. In 1981, David Lynch was hired as director by [58]executive
   producer [59]Dino De Laurentiis.

   The film was not well received by critics and performed poorly at the
   American box office at the time. Upon its release, director David Lynch
   distanced himself from the project, stating that pressure from both
   producers and financiers restrained his [60]artistic control and denied
   him [61]final cut.

   Fans of the Dune series are polarized by the movie, although in the
   years since its release, the film has become a [62]cult favorite, and
   at least three different versions have been released worldwide. In some
   cuts of the film Lynch's name is replaced in the credits with the name
   of a fictional director [63]Alan Smithee, a pseudonym used by directors
   who wish not to be associated with a film for which they would normally
   be credited.

[[80]edit] Plot

   In the far future, the known universe is ruled by [81]Padishah Emperor
   [82]Shaddam Corrino IV; the most precious substance in his sprawling
   [83]feudal galactic empire is the spice [84]melange, which extends
   life, expands consciousness and is vital to space travel. The powerful
   [85]Spacing Guild and its [86]Navigators use the spice to safely guide
   interstellar ships to any part of the universe instantaneously.

   Four planets draw the attention of the Guild: [87]Arrakis, a [88]desert
   planet and only source of spice in the universe; [89]Caladan, home of
   [90]House Atreides; [91]Giedi Prime, home of [92]House Harkonnen; and
   [93]Kaitain, home of the Emperor. The Guild, fearing a plot that might
   jeopardize spice production, sends a Navigator to demand an explanation
   from the Emperor, who confidentially shares his plans to destroy House
   Atreides. The popularity of [94]Duke Leto Atreides has grown, and as
   Leto is suspected to be amassing a secret army using sound weapons
   called [95]Weirding Modules, he is now a threat to the Emperor.
   Shaddam's plan is to give the Atreides control of Arrakis, replacing
   the Harkonnens, who at an appointed time would launch a sneak attack on
   the Atreides. Upon being informed of the plot, the Navigator commands
   the Emperor to kill the Duke's son, [96]Paul Atreides, a young man who
   dreams prophetic visions of his purpose. The cryptic assassination
   order draws the attention of the [97]Bene Gesserit sisterhood, as Paul
   Atreides is tied to their centuries-long [98]breeding program in search
   of the superhuman [99]Kwisatz Haderach.

   Paul is tested by the Bene Gesserit [100]Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
   Mohiam with a deadly [101]gom jabbar at his throat. Paul is forced to
   place his hand in a box, which subjects him to excruciating and
   increasing pain; he passes to Mohiam's satisfaction, withstanding more
   pain than anyone has before him. Meanwhile, in the industrial world of
   Giedi Prime, the sadistic [102]Baron Vladimir Harkonnen tells his
   nephews [103]Glossu Rabban and [104]Feyd-Rautha about his plan to
   eliminate their centuries long enemies, the Atreides, by manipulating
   someone very close to the Duke into betraying him.

   The Atreides leave Caladan for Arrakis, a barren world of vast deserts,
   filled with gigantic [105]sandworms and populated by the [106]Fremen,
   mysterious people who have long held a prophecy that a [107]messiah
   would come to lead them to true freedom. Upon arrival on Arrakis, Leto
   is informed by one of his right-hand men, [108]Duncan Idaho, that the
   Fremen have been largely underestimated, as they exist in vast numbers
   on Arrakis and could prove to be powerful allies. Leto gains the trust
   of the people of Arrakis, proving to be a charismatic and just leader.
   But before the Duke can establish an alliance with the Fremen, the
   Harkonnens launch their attack.

   While the Atreides had anticipated a trap, they are unable to withstand
   the devastating Harkonnen sneak attack, supported by the Emperor's
   elite troops, the [109]Sardaukar, and aided by a traitor within House
   Atreides itself, [110]Dr. Wellington Yueh. Captured, Leto dies in a
   failed attempt to assassinate the Baron Harkonnen using a poison gas
   capsule planted in his tooth by Dr. Yueh. Leto's [111]concubine
   [112]Jessica and his son Paul escape into the deep desert, and with
   Jessica's Bene Gesserit abilities and Paul's developing skills, they
   manage to join a band of native Fremen. Paul emerges as [113]Muad'Dib,
   the religious and political leader the Fremen have been waiting for.
   Paul teaches the Fremen to use the Weirding Modules and begins
   targeting mining production of spice. In the span of two years, spice
   production is effectively halted. The Emperor is warned by the Spacing
   Guild of the situation on Arrakis, and the Guild fears that Paul will
   consume a substance known as the [114]Water of Life. These fears are
   revealed to Paul in a prophetic dream; he drinks the Water of Life and
   enters a coma that disturbs all Bene Gesserits in the universe.
   Awaking, Paul is transformed and gains control of the sandworms of
   Arrakis. He has also discovered the secret to controlling spice
   production; water kept in huge caches by the Fremen can be used to
   destroy the spice. Paul tells his army of Fremen "he who can destroy a
   thing controls it." Paul has also seen into space and the future; the
   Emperor is amassing a huge invasionary fleet above Arrakis to regain
   control of the planet and the spice.

   Upon the Emperor's arrival at Arrakis, Paul launches a final attack
   against both the Harkonnens and the Emperor at the capital city of
   [115]Arakeen. His Fremen warriors, armed with Weirding Modules and
   riding sandworms, defeat the Emperor's legions of Sardaukar while
   Paul's sister [116]Alia kills the Baron Harkonnen. Paul faces the
   defeated Emperor, and avenges his family in a duel to the death with
   Feyd-Rautha. After defeating Feyd, Paul commands rain to fall on
   Arrakis. Alia reveals to everyone that Paul is indeed the Kwisatz
   Haderach.

[[165]edit] Production

   Pre-release flyer for [166]Jodorowsky's Dune

   Shot almost entirely in Mexico, the movie is an adaptation of the first
   of a series of novels (see [167]Dune, by Frank Herbert) and
   incorporating some elements from the later novels. The pre-production
   process was [168]slow and problematic, and the project was handed from
   director to director.^[169][1]

   In 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by
   [170]Arthur P. Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune. As Jacobs was
   busy with other projects, such as the sequel to [171]Planet of the
   Apes, the project was delayed for another year. Originally, it was to
   be directed by [172]David Lean, with [173]Robert Bolt writing the
   screenplay, and shooting scheduled to begin in 1974. In 1973, Arthur P.
   Jacobs died.

   In December 1974, a [174]French consortium led by [175]Jean-Paul Gibon
   purchased the [176]film rights from APJ. [177]Alejandro Jodorowsky was
   set to direct. In 1975, Jodorowsky planned to film the story as a ten
   hour feature, in collaboration with [178]Orson Welles, [179]Dan
   O'Bannon, [180]Salvador Dal, [181]Gloria Swanson, [182]Herv Villechaize
   and others (whom he nicknamed his "seven samurais"). The music would be
   composed by [183]Pink Floyd. Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in
   Paris consisting of [184]Chris Foss, a British artist who designed
   covers for science fiction periodicals, [185]Jean Giraud (Moebius), a
   French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for [186]Metal
   Hurlant magazine, and [187]H. R. Giger. Moebius began designing
   creatures and characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to
   design the film's space ships and hardware. Giger began designing the
   Harkonnen Castle based on Moebius' storyboards, and Dali was cast as
   the Emperor with a reported salary of $100,000 an hour. Jodorowsky also
   hired [188]Dan O'Bannon to head the special effects department.

   Dali and Jodorowsky began quarreling over money, and just as the
   storyboards, designs, and script were finished, the financial backing
   dried up. Frank Herbert travelled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2
   million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in
   pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour
   movie ("It was the size of a phonebook", Herbert later recalled).
   Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but
   Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship.

   The rights for filming were sold once more, this time to Dino de
   Laurentiis. Although Jodorowsky was embittered by the experience, he
   stated that the Dune project changed his life. Dan O'Bannon entered a
   psychiatric hospital after the production failed, and worked on 13
   scripts; his 13th became [189]Alien.^[190][2] In 1978, De Laurentiis
   commissioned Herbert to write a new screenplay, but Herbert's 175-page
   script was rejected an average script is 110 pages long.

   De Laurentiis then hired director [191]Ridley Scott in 1979, with
   Rudolph Wurlitzer writing the screenplay and H.R. Giger retained from
   the Jodorowsky production. Scott intended to split the book into two
   movies. He worked on three drafts of the script, using [192]The Battle
   of Algiers as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another
   [193]science fiction film, 1982's [194]Blade Runner. As he recalls, the
   pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have
   been even more time-intensive:

     But after seven months I dropped out of Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer
     had come up with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent
     distillation of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was going
     to take a lot more work at least two and a half years' worth. And I
     didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank
     unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis
     picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told
     him the Dune script was his. From Ridley Scott: The Making of his
     Movies by Paul M. Sammon

   In 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis
   re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to
   the Dune sequels (written and unwritten). After seeing [195]The
   Elephant Man, Raffaella De Laurentiis decided that [196]David Lynch
   should direct the movie. Around that time Lynch received several other
   directing offers, including [197]Return of the Jedi. He agreed to
   direct Dune and write the screenplay even though he had not read the
   book, known the story, or even been interested in science
   fiction.^[198][3] David Lynch worked on the script for six months with
   Eric Bergen and Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the
   script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would
   subsequently work on five more drafts.

   On [199]March 30, [200]1983, with the 135-page 6th draft of the script,
   Dune finally began shooting. With a budget of over 40 million dollars,
   Dune required 80 sets built on 16 sound stages and a total crew of
   1700. Many of the exterior shots were filmed in the [201]Samalayuca
   Dunes in [202]Chihuahua. Upon completion, the rough cut of Dune without
   [203]post-production effects ran over four hours long, but Lynch's
   intended cut of the film (as reflected in the 7th and final draft of
   the script) was three hours long.

   However, Universal Pictures and the film's financiers expected a
   standard, two-hour cut of the film. To reduce the [204]run time,
   producers [205]Dino De Laurentiis, [206]Raffaella De Laurentiis, and
   director David Lynch excised numerous scenes, filmed new scenes that
   simplified or concentrated plot elements, and added [207]voice-over
   narrations, plus a new introduction by Virginia Madsen. Contrary to
   popular rumors, Lynch made no other version of the movie besides the
   theatrical cut; no three to six hour version ever reached the
   post-production stage. However, several longer versions have been
   spliced together.^[208][4]

   In the introduction for his 1985 [209]short story collection [210]Eye,
   Frank Herbert discussed the film's reception and his participation in
   the production, and listed scenes that were shot but left out of the
   released version.^[211][5] Herbert stated he was satisfied with the
   final release, but expressed disappointment that some of the scenes he
   saw on the rough cuts of Dune failed to make the theatrical
   cut.^[212][6]

[[213]edit] Release

   Dune's premiere was on [214]December 3, [215]1984 at [216]The Kennedy
   Center in [217]Washington, D.C., and was released worldwide on
   [218]December 14. Publicity for Dune was extensive before its release,
   not only because it was based on a best-selling novel but because it
   was directed by David Lynch, who had success with Eraserhead and The
   Elephant Man. Several magazines followed the production, and published
   articles praising the film before its release,^[219][7] all part of the
   advertising and merchandising of Dune, which also included a
   documentary for television as well as items placed in toy
   stores.^[220][8]

[[221]edit] Reception

   In his review, critic [222]Roger Ebert gave Dune one star out of four
   and wrote "This movie is a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly,
   unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the
   most confusing screenplays of all time."^[223][9] Ebert added that "The
   movie's plot will no doubt mean more to people who've read Herbert than
   to those who are walking in cold," and later named it "the worst movie
   of the year."^[224][10] On [225]At The Movies with [226]Gene Siskel and
   Ebert, Siskel began his review by saying "it's physically ugly, it
   contains at least a dozen gory gross-out scenes, some of its special
   effects are cheap surprisingly cheap because this film cost a reported
   40 to 45 million dollars and its story is confusing beyond belief. In
   case I haven't made myself clear, I hated watching this
   film."^[227][11] The film was later listed as the worst film of 1984 in
   their "Stinkers of 1984" episode.^[228][12] Other negative reviews
   focused on the same issues as well as on the length of the
   film.^[229][13]

   [230]Janet Maslin of [231]The New York Times also gave Dune a negative
   review of one star out of five. She said that, "Several of the
   characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position
   of being able to understand what goes on in the movie" and explained
   that the plot was "perilously overloaded, as is virtually everything
   else about it."

   The staff of [232]Variety gave Dune a more favorable, but still
   negative review stating "Dune is a huge, hollow, imaginative and cold
   sci-fi epic. Visually unique and teeming with incident, David Lynch's
   film holds the interest due to its abundant surface attractions but
   won't, of its own accord, create the sort of fanaticism which has made
   Frank Herbert's 1965 novel one of the all-time favorites in its genre."
   They also commented on how "Lynch's adaptation covers the entire span
   of the novel, but simply setting up the various worlds, characters,
   intrigues and forces at work requires more than a half-hour of
   expository screen time." They did enjoy the cast and said that
   "Francesca Annis and Jurgen Prochnow make an outstandingly attractive
   royal couple, Sin Phillips has some mesmerizing moments as a powerful
   witch, Brad Dourif is effectively loony, and best of all is Kenneth
   McMillan, whose face is covered with grotesque growths and who floats
   around like the [233]Blue Meanie come to life."

   [234]Richard Corliss of [235]Time magazine gave Dune a negative review,
   stating that "Most sci-fi movies offer escape, a holiday from homework,
   but Dune is as difficult as a final exam. You have to cram for it." He
   noted that "MacLachlan, 25, grows impressively in the role; his
   features, soft and spoiled at the beginning, take on a he-manly glamour
   once he assumes his mission." He ended by saying "The actors seem
   hypnotized by the spell Lynch has woven around them especially the
   lustrous Francesca Annis, as Paul's mother, who whispers her lines with
   the urgency of erotic revelation. In those moments when Annis is
   onscreen, Dune finds the emotional center that has eluded it in its
   parade of rococo decor and austere special effects. She reminds us of
   what movies can achieve when they have a heart as well as a mind."

   While most critics were negative towards Dune, critic and science
   fiction writer [236]Harlan Ellison was of a different opinion at the
   time. In his 1989 book of film criticism [237]Harlan Ellison's
   Watching, he says that the $42 million production failed because
   critics were denied screenings at the last minute after several
   re-schedules, a decision by Universal that, according to Ellison, made
   the film community feel nervous and negative towards Dune before its
   release.^[238][14] Ellison eventually became one of the film's few
   positive reviewers.

   The few more favorable reviews praised Lynch's [239]noir-[240]baroque
   approach to the film. Others compare it to other Lynch films that are
   equally hard to access, such as [241]Eraserhead, and assert that in
   order to watch it, the viewer must first be aware of the Dune universe.
   In the years since its initial release Dune has become a cult favorite,
   and has gained more positive reviews from online critics^[242][15] and
   viewers.^[243][16]

   As a result of its poor commercial and critical reception, all initial
   plans of Dune's sequels were cancelled. It was reported that David
   Lynch was working on the screenplay for [244]Dune Messiah ^[245][17]
   and was hired to direct a second and a third Dune film.

   In retrospect, Lynch "admitted he should never have directed Dune,"
   ^[246][18] and prefers not to discuss it in interviews. Universal has
   approached him for a possible [247]Director's cut of the film, but
   Lynch has rejected every offer.

     I started selling out on Dune. Looking back, it's no one's fault but
     my own. I probably shouldn't have done that picture, but I saw tons
     and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the
     structure to do them in. There was so much room to create a world.
     But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis
     of what kind of film they expected, and I knew I didn't have final
     cut. David Lynch, on Dune^[248][19]

[[249]edit] Departures from the novel

   The film makes numerous departures from the novel, most notably in the
   case of the [250]Weirding Way, which in the novel is a form of training
   that allows Paul Atreides to move with lightning speed and have
   near-perfect dexterity. In the film it is replaced with "[251]Weirding
   Modules," sonic weapons that resemble small video cameras and amplify
   the user's voice into a destructive force. Since the time of release,
   this has been controversial among Dune fans.^[252][20]^[253][21]
   Reportedly, the original technique was left out because it was thought
   that a pitched combat of [254]Fremen fighting [255]Sardaukar while
   using the book's Weirding Way would resemble an unsophisticated
   [256]kung-fu film. Additionally, the Weirding Modules provided an
   opportunity for the use of special effects as characters ran at their
   enemies shouting "Muad'dib!" repeatedly while pointing the devices at
   them. This change literalized a moment in the novel in which Paul says
   his name had become a death-prayer, as the Fremen shout "Muad'dib!"
   before killing an opponent. In the film, a Fremen training with the
   weirding module says "Muad'dib" and accidentally destroys a ceiling,
   leading Paul to make the remark "my name is a killing word."

   The film grants the Bene Gesserit [257]telepathy, while the novel notes
   their keen, nearly superhuman awareness. In a scene in which Spacing
   Guild members are responsible for covering up the Guild Navigator's
   activities, they cannot speak normally, but instead use a translating
   device, which has the appearance of a vintage radio microphone. Hawat
   is forced to milk a gruesome captive cat daily for the antidote to the
   [258]residual poison in his body. The Harkonnens drink the juices of
   crushed insects; they also have heart-plugs, sadistic devices that
   terminate slaves by "unplugging" their hearts.

   There are several distinctive visual and [259]aesthetic choices made in
   the film that do not seem directly inspired by Herbert's novel. In the
   film, the Bene Gesserit women adopt shaven heads when they become
   Reverend Mothers and the Mentats have enormous eyebrows. The 'thopters
   ([260]ornithopters) are depicted as wingless, jet- or rocket-propelled
   aircraft, while the color of the Arrakeen sky is changed from silver to
   orange.

   Perhaps most conspicuously, both Paul and Feyd-Rautha are older in the
   film than in the novel. There is no mention in the film of the reasons
   for their mutual hatred, which are explained in detail in the novel.
   Furthermore, their climactic duel is reduced in both significance and
   length in the film.

   Several characters are entirely excluded from the film adaptation,
   presumably as a result of time limitations, such as [261]Count Fenring,
   his Bene Gesserit wife [262]Margot, and several other minor characters.
   The deaths of characters such as Thufir Hawat, Baron Harkonnen, and
   Rabban were altered or omitted altogether.

   The final line in the novel, spoken by Jessica to Chani, is "We who
   carry the name of concubine - history will call us wives" (in reference
   to Paul's marriage to and refusal of Irulan). In the film, the final
   lines (spoken by Alia) are "And how can this be? For he is the
   [263]Kwisatz Haderach!", and are delivered after Paul apparently
   magically (or miraculously) makes it rain on Arrakis.

   Some of the novel's central themes were minimized for the adaptation;
   political topics such as the "unstable tripod of power" in the novel's
   universe (Emperor, Landsraad, and Guild) were not depicted
   faithfully.^[264][22] The Guild treats the Emperor like a lackey rather
   than an equal power, while the Landsraad is almost non-existent. The
   book has the Guild operating behind the scenes, and their dependence on
   spice is only revealed at the end. It is not said that they were
   involved in the original plot against Duke Leto Atreides.

   The Emperor's main concern in the book is that the Fremen are
   potentially as dangerous as his Sardaukar, the toughness of each group
   being reckoned to come from the harshness of their environment. He is
   less concerned with spice, reckoning he will get his share whoever
   controls it.

   The themes of religion how the Bene Gesserit use it as a tool, how
   politicians and the state can manipulate religious beliefs for their
   own advantage, and how Paul takes advantage of the Bene Gesserit's
   manipulation of Fremen religion whilst simultaneously fearing and
   resisting having to do so these, while being significant elements of
   the novel, were either ignored in the film, or used literally (while
   removed from their contexts). In the novel, Paul takes on the aspects
   of the Fremen messiah (religious imagery which was planted there ages
   ago by the Bene Gesserit) out of necessity for his survival and
   acceptance among the Fremen, but is extremely reluctant until the very
   end to accept the role of messiah because he is aware of the
   consequences (a genocidal religious war that the Fremen will carry out
   against all who do not accept Paul's divinity, killing billions.) It is
   unusual circumstances, coincidences, and converging political
   conspiracies, combined with his abilities as the Kwisatz Haderach, that
   ironically grant Paul the appearance of the divinity and holy powers
   the Fremen believe him to have, much to Paul's unease. The novel
   simultaneously demonstrates how the Bene Gesserit have become caught up
   in the religions they have manipulated, and how they ultimately fall
   victim to a false messiah they themselves helped to create. However, in
   the film, this complexity is completely left out, and Paul truly is the
   holy man the Fremen believe him to be; he is not reluctant to take on
   the mantle of the Fremen messiah, and the tragic irony of his situation
   is completely absent, as is his prescient awareness of the cataclysmic
   consequences of the Fremen belief in his divinity.

   The ecological themes were not addressed as they were through the
   series: the film ends with rain falling on Arrakis, apparently at
   Paul's command. In the novel, this was accomplished decades later,
   through great efforts by the Fremen and years of [265]terraforming.
   Additionally, a plot complication is created because rain falling on
   Arrakis would effectively stop spice production, as in the novel, water
   is poisonous to the sandworms, and a wet environment on Arrakis would
   eradicate them.^[266][23]

[[267]edit] Versions

   Despite a scathing overall reception, the movie has achieved a
   respectable cult status of which at least three other versions outside
   the original theatrical cut have been released. In grand total, five
   versions of Dune are known.

[[268]edit] Theatrical cut

   Released worldwide in 1984, it was edited by 37 seconds in the UK to
   pass PG rating, at a total running time of 137 minutes. Though this
   137-minute version was not David Lynch's intended cut, it is the only
   director-approved version and the only official version he ever made of
   the film for release. It is widely available on both VHS and [269]DVD.
   In 2006 it was remastered for a special DVD release, and as of late
   2006 has been released on HD-DVD with many of the special features seen
   on other discs.

[[270]edit] Alan Smithee version

   The 189-minute "[271]Alan Smithee" version was released in 1989.
   Prepared originally for syndicated television (and later seen on basic
   cable television networks) for a two-night broadcast, it was prepared
   without either participation or authorization by David Lynch. The
   missing footage includes a painted montage at the prologue, and several
   scenes reinserted, including the "little-maker" essence-of-spice scene.
   The television version was edited in a seemingly haphazard way (for
   example, certain shots were repeated throughout the film to create the
   impression that new footage had been added). Lynch objected to these
   edits and had his name removed from the credits of this print (which
   were replaced by Alan Smithee and Judas Booth). This version was
   initially only released on laserdisc in Japan, but has also been found
   as a poorly recorded VHS on the bootleg market.^[272][24] It is now
   available worldwide on DVD.

[[273]edit] Channel 2 version

   In 1992, [274]KTVU, a [275]San Francisco, CA [276]Fox affiliate, pieced
   together a hybrid edit of the two previous versions for broadcast in
   the San Francisco Bay Area. It is essentially the television version
   with all the violence of the theatrical version reincorporated into the
   film, along with many of the "fabricated" shots objected to by Lynch
   removed.

   An Extended Edition DVD version was released in Europe in November
   2005. It includes, among its many extra features, an extended version
   of the film, credited to Alan Smithee, which is 177 minutes long. The
   booklet explains that this version was created for an American
   television channel, and is most likely the aforementioned Channel 2
   Version. Neither the video nor the audio was remastered, exhibiting a
   poor television-like quality. Although the cover states that the
   soundtrack is in mono sound, it is, in fact, in stereo.^[[277]citation
   needed]

[[278]edit] Extended Edition

   An Extended Edition was released by Universal Home Entertainment in the
   US on DVD on [279]January 31, [280]2006. The DVD contains both Lynch's
   137-minute theatrical cut and a 177-minute edit of the Alan Smithee
   television version (the latter being presented for the first time in
   its original [281]anamorphic aspect ratio). It also features a
   documentary on the production design and special effects, as well as a
   supplementary section of outtakes and scenes not included in any
   previous version of the film, including an alternate ending.

[[282]edit] Workprint version

   An [283]assembly of all footage after the completion of principal
   photography was shown to the crew in Mexico, as well as to Frank
   Herbert. Contrary to popular fan rumors, it was by no means the
   Director's Cut of the film. This workprint version is the basis of such
   rumors, but there was never a four-hour cut of the movie in its
   complete form. In the [284]fan edit online communities, attempts have
   been made to re-assemble different versions of the film closer to David
   Lynch's intent and the original novel by using the deleted scenes and
   fixing any technical errors from the Smithee version.^[285][25]

[[286]edit] Influence on popular culture

   The [287]Reverend Mother and the Lady Elara from [288]Emperor: Battle
   for Dune
   Emperor Frederick Corrino IV from [289]Dune 2000

   The film inspired the [290]Cryo Interactive video game [291]Dune, which
   used elements (such as the Weirding Modules) unique to the film. The
   character of Paul Atreides was designed to look like Kyle MacLachlan,
   and the CD version of the game included footage of the film. The
   [292]Westwood Studios [293]Dune games ([294]Dune II, [295]Dune 2000 and
   [296]Emperor: Battle for Dune) were also visually influenced by the
   film. For example, the Emperor in Dune 2000 and the [297]Reverend
   Mother in Emperor: Battle for Dune resemble the equivalent characters
   in Lynch's film.

   Dialogue and music from the film have been sampled in various songs. On
   their album Machine Language, the techno-music DJ group [298]Dynamix
   II's song "Get Out of My Mind" samples the Mohiam/Alia scene which
   features the titular line. Virginia Madsen's opening monologue is also
   featured in several songs by artists including [299]Aphrodite,
   [300]Astral Projection, and [301]MFG. The Christian
   [302]industrial/[303]dance band [304]Mortal samples from the film in
   their 1993 album Fathom, including featuring Baron Harkonnen's line
   "I'm alive!" in the song "Alive and Awake." The 1990 production of
   "Spice" by [305]Eon (musician) also contains dialogue from the Baron
   and Guild Navigators. The retro-swing band [306]Rayzd, on their
   Dune-inspired album Fear is the Mind Killer, samples the [307]Litany
   against fear and other audio clips on their song "Your Mind."

   Dune is the likely inspiration for the lyrics "Walk without rhythm, it
   won't attract the worm" in the song "[308]Star 69 / Weapon of Choice"
   by [309]Fatboy Slim. In the novel, Paul notes "We must walk without
   rhythm" to avoid notice by a sandworm as he and Jessica cross the
   desert; Lynch's Dune (1984) features Paul's line "If we walk without
   rhythm, we won't attract the worm" 82 minutes into the film.^[310][26]
