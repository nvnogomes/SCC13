[[41]edit] Game rules

   The Game consists of two different rounds:
   1^st Round: in the first round, 2 Contestants compete against each
   other in a best three-out-of-five format in which they are asked a
   'Poll Question' and asked to provide a whole percentage number that
   most closely approximates the exact survey poll answer for the
   question. The contestant whose answers' are closest to the poll results
   for 3 out of 5 national survey questions wins the 'First-Round'. The
   Contestant who loses is then eliminated from the game.
   2^nd Round: the Contestant who wins the first-round plays the game to
   win up to Rs. 10,00,00,000/- (10 Crore Rupees) by trying to correctly
   approximate the survey's results within a narrowing percentage range
   for up to 4 poll questions. In this round, the contestant was given
   similar questions, and placed a range on a scale from 0% to 100% that
   included the correct answer (for example, if the answer was 53%, then
   the contestant's range must have included 53%). The size of the range
   decreased as the money values increased:
     * Rs.10,000 question: 40% range
     * Rs.1,00,000 question: 30% range
     * Rs.10,00,000 question: 20% range
     * Rs.1,00,00,000 question: 10% range
     * Rs.10,00,00,000 question: Exact guess on the previous question (see
       below)

   For the first 3 poll questions, the correct answer to the question was
   revealed once the contestant locked-in an answer by pulling down a
   lever. For the 4th question of Rs.1,00,00,000, the correct answer was
   revealed only-if the contestant's range missed the question. And if the
   question was answered correctly, the contestant was then given the
   chance to win Rs.10,00,00,000 by picking the exact percentage (rounded
   to the nearest 1%) out of that 10% range (11 choices in all). In
   addition, the Contestant has the opportunity to consult with his/her
   designated supporter before deciding whether to Lock-In a response at
   the Rs.10,00,00,000 prize level. Also, as with the lower prize levels,
   the Contestant may elect to take the walk-away prize for the
   Rs.10,00,00,000 (Ten Crore Rupees) prize level i.e. Rs. 10,00,000 (Ten
   Lakhs Rupees) and terminate the game prior to locking in a response.
   However, if the contestant decides to lock in a response, the response
   cannot be changed, and the Contestant no longer has the option of
   taking the walk-away prize of Rs.1,00,00,000 (One Crore Rupees). If the
   contestant locks in a response, the survey result for the poll question
   is than revealed. If the survey's result is exactly the same as the
   Contestants response, the Contestant is than awarded Rs.10,00,00,000
   (Ten Crore Rupees). But, if the survey's result is not exactly the same
   as the Contestants response, the Contestant will be awarded
   Rs.10,00,000 (Ten Lakhs Rupees).
