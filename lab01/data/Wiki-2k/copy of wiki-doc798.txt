[[38]edit] Plot

   The beginning of the movie shows Magdalena performing her duties as
   part of her cousin Eileen's (Alicia Sixtos) quinceaera. The story
   covers two quinceaeras, Eileen's and later, Magdalena's. Magdalena, who
   is thinking of her upcoming quinceaera, her boyfriend Herman (JR Cruz),
   and the [39]Hummer limo she really wants to have, soon discovers that
   she is pregnant after trying on her hand-me-down dress from Eileen's
   quinceaera. At first, her boyfriend doesn't believe her, because the
   sexual contact they had was without penetration. When her father, the
   minister in a storefront church, learns of her predicament, he doesn't
   believe that she is a [40]virgin and banishes her from their home.
   Abandoned by her family, Magdalena moves in with her elderly
   great-uncle, Tomas. She and her boyfriend try do to as much as they
   can, but he eventually abandons her.

   Also living with Tomas is Magdalena's cousin, Carlos, who works at a
   car wash and who has been banished by his own parents because they
   suspect, correctly, he is [41]gay. Carlos is the brother of Eileen, he
   was shown in the beginning of the film, arriving at Eileen's quinceaera
   uninvited. Carlos was drunk and simply wanted to give Eileen a gift but
   his parents decide that he is only there to cause trouble and let the
   rest of the family know that he is a homosexual, something that they
   suspect but do not want to believe. They kicked him out of the party
   and it continues on as was. Tomas' new landlords, an older and white
   gay couple, invite Carlos to their housewarming party and subsequently
   seduce him. Even though they are almost ten years older. They like the
   that Carlos is a younger, 'gangster' with baggy clothing and tattoos,
   as it is hinted to the fact that they regularly use confused young
   homosexuals in a sexual way. Carlos begins an affair with one of them;
   when the other discovers the affair, Tomas and his young charges are
   evicted from their home out of jealousy.

   Magdalena and Carlos each try to save their little family in their own
   way. Magdalena tries to find them all a home, and Carlos resolves to
   find a better job so that he can support them while Magdalena finishes
   school. However, overcome with grief at losing his home, Tomas suffers
   from a heart attack and later dies. This results in a reunion between
   Magdalena and her mother, who takes Magdalena to a doctor. The doctor
   confirms that Magdalena's [42]hymen is intact, and that pregnancy
   without [43]sexual intercourse is possible. Magdalena reconciles with
   her father at Tomas' funeral, and the film ends with Magdalena's
   quinceaera, with everything she dreams of.
