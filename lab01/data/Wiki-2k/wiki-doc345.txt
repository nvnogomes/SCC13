   The Vicar of Wakefield is a novel by the [10]Irish author [11]Oliver
   Goldsmith. It was written in 1761 and 1762, and published in 1766. It
   was one of the most popular and widely read 18th century novels among
   19th century Victorians, for instance mentioned in George Eliot's
   [12]Middlemarch, Jane Austen's [13]Emma, Charles Dickens' [14]A Tale of
   Two Cities and [15]David Copperfield, Mary Shelley's [16]Frankenstein,
   Charlotte Bront's [17]The Professor and [18]Villette, Louisa May
   Alcott's [19]Little Women and in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's [20]The
   Sorrows of Young Werther as well as his [21]Dichtung und Wahrheit.

[[29]edit] Publication

   [30]Dr Samuel Johnson, who was one of Goldsmith's closest friends, told
   how The Vicar of Wakefield came to be sold for publication:^[31][1]
   I received one morning a message from poor Goldsmith that he was in
   great distress, and, as it was not in his power to come to me, begging
   that I would come to him as soon as possible. I sent him a [32]guinea,
   and promised to come to him directly. I accordingly went as soon as I
   was dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested him for his rent,
   at which he was in a violent passion: I perceived that he had already
   changed my guinea, and had a bottle of [33]Madeira and a glass before
   him. I put the cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm, and
   began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He
   then told me he had a novel ready for the press, which he produced to
   me. I looked into it and saw its merit; told the landlady I should soon
   return; and, having gone to a bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds. I
   brought Goldsmith the money, and he discharged his rent, not without
   rating his landlady in a high tone for having used him so ill.

   The novel was The Vicar of Wakefield, and Johnson had sold it to
   [34]Francis Newbery, a nephew of [35]John. Newbery "kept it by him for
   nearly two years unpublished".^[36][1]

[[37]edit] Content

   Dr Primrose, his wife Deborah and their six children live an idyllic
   life in a country [38]parish. The vicar is well-off due to investing an
   inheritance he received from a deceased relative, and the vicar donates
   the 34 pounds that his job pays annually to local orphans and war
   veterans. On the evening of his son George's wedding to wealthy
   Arabella Wilmot, the [39]vicar loses all his money through the
   bankruptcy of his merchant investor who left town with his money.

   The wedding is called off by Arabella's father, who is known for his
   prudence with money. George, who was educated at Oxford and is old
   enough to be considered an adult, is sent away to town. The rest of the
   family move to a new and more humble parish on the land of Squire
   Thornhill, who is known to be a womanizer. On the way, they hear about
   the dubious reputation of their new landlord. Also, references are made
   to the squire's uncle Sir William Thornhill, who is known throughout
   the country for his worthiness and generosity.

   A poor and eccentric friend, Mr. Burchell, whom they meet at an inn,
   rescues Sophia from drowning. She is instantly attracted to him, but
   her ambitious mother does not encourage her feelings.

   Then follows a period of happy family life, only interrupted by regular
   visits of the dashing Squire Thornhill and Mr. Burchell. Olivia is
   captivated by Thornhill's hollow charm, but he also encourages the
   social ambitions of Mrs Primrose and her daughters to a ludicrous
   degree.

   Finally, Olivia is reported to have fled. First Burchell is suspected,
   but after a long pursuit Dr. Primrose finds his daughter, who was in
   reality deceived by Squire Thornhill. He planned to marry her in a mock
   ceremony and leave her then shortly after, as he had done with several
   women before.

   When Olivia and her father return home, they find their house in
   flames. Although the family has lost almost all their belongings, the
   evil Squire Thornhill insists on the payment of the rent. As the vicar
   cannot pay, he is brought to gaol.

   What follows now is a chain of dreadful occurrences. The vicar's
   daughter Olivia is reported dead, Sophia abducted and George is also
   brought to gaol in chains and covered with blood, as he had challenged
   Thornhill to a [40]duel, when he had heard about his wickedness.

   But then Mr. Burchell arrives and solves all problems. He rescues
   Sophia, Olivia is not dead and it emerges that Burchell is in reality
   the worthy Sir William Thornhill, who travels through the country in
   disguise. In the end there is a double wedding: George marries
   Arabella, as he originally intended, and Sir William Thornhill marries
   Sophia. Squire Thornhill's servant turns out to have tricked him, and
   thus the sham marriage of the Squire and Olivia is real. Finally even
   the wealth of the vicar is restored, as the bankrupt merchant is
   reported to be found.

[[41]edit] Structure and narrative technique

   The book consists of 32 chapters which fall into three parts:
     * chapter 1 - 3: beginning
     * chapter 4 - 29: main part
     * chapter 30 - 32: ending

   Chapter 17, when Olivia is reported to be fled, can be regarded as the
   climax as well as an essential turning point of the novel. From chapter
   17 onwards it changes from a comical account of 18th century country
   life into a pathetic melodrama with didactic traits.

   There are quite a few interpolations of different literary genres, such
   as poems, histories or sermons, which widen the restricted view of the
   first person narrator and serve as didactic fables.

   The novel can be regarded as a fictitious memoir, as it is told by the
   vicar himself by retrospection.

[[42]edit] Reception

   In literary history books the Vicar of Wakefield is often described as
   a sentimental novel, which displays the belief in the innate goodness
   of human beings. But it can also be read as a satire on the sentimental
   novel and its values, as the vicar's values are apparently not
   compatible with the real "sinful" world. It is only with Sir William
   Thornhill's help that he can get out of his calamities.

   Moreover, an analogy can be drawn between Mr. Primrose's suffering and
   the [43]Book of Job. This is particularly relevant to the question of
   [44]theodicy.
