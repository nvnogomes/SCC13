[[48]edit] History

   Downtown Disney began life on [49]March 22, [50]1975, as the Lake Buena
   Vista Shopping Village, a shopping complex intended to serve the
   planned residences within Walt Disney World property. As the
   residential units evolved into more resort hotel space, the complex
   became more focused as a shopping destination for all Walt Disney World
   visitors, and renamed Walt Disney World Village in 1977. With the
   advent of new management under [51]Michael Eisner in the mid-1980s,
   Disney began looking for ways to keep vacationers on Walt Disney World
   property longer, and entice them with offerings to prevent them from
   leaving for entertainment beyond Disney's borders. To compete with the
   popular Church Street Station clubs in downtown Orlando, [52]Pleasure
   Island was announced on [53]July 21, [54]1986, as an expansion to the
   Village for highly themed, adults-only nightlife. Construction began
   the following August, and Pleasure Island opened on [55]May 1,
   [56]1989, (the exact same day as the [57]Disney-MGM Studios theme park)
   featuring unique clubs with the Disney touch for quality and
   creativity. That same year, the Walt Disney World Village was once
   again renamed as the Disney Village Marketplace to reflect the
   ever-changing nature of the area. In the mid-1990s, the growth of Walt
   Disney World once again created the potential for expansion of the
   offerings around Village Lake at Pleasure Island and the Disney Village
   Marketplace, so on [58]June 20, [59]1995, major enhancements and
   expansion were announced for the area. The Disney Village Marketplace
   and Pleasure Island would be folded into a newly-branded district
   called Downtown Disney, with the former renamed one more time on
   [60]September 7, [61]1997, as Downtown Disney Marketplace. Just a few
   days later, on [62]September 15, Downtown Disney West Side opened as a
   third shopping, dining, and entertainment zone featuring more eclectic
   venues such as [63]La Nouba (a permanent show which is part of
   [64]Cirque du Soleil), [65]DisneyQuest, and [66]Virgin Megastore. Major
   changes for the complex also included the conversion of the somewhat
   sedate Mickey's Character Shop into the bustling [67]World of Disney,
   becoming the world's largest Disney store, and the expansion and
   upgrade of the AMC Pleasure Island Theatres. Downtown Disney gained a
   sister district on [68]January 12, [69]2001, with the expansion of the
   [70]Disneyland Resort in [71]Anaheim, California, and similar complexes
   known as [72]Disney Village on [73]April 12, [74]1992, at
   [75]EuroDisney (now Disneyland Resort Paris), and [76]Ikspiari on
   [77]July 7, [78]2000, at the [79]Tokyo Disney Resort. A fifth version
   is in planning for the most recent Disney destination, [80]Hong Kong
   Disneyland.

   The Village/Marketplace and West Side have always been free to enter,
   while Pleasure Island required the purchase of admission. Pleasure
   Island was also closed during the day. Starting in the summer of 2004,
   Pleasure Island became free to enter and only those entering the
   nightclubs paid admission charges.

   On [81]September 27, [82]2008 all of the Pleasure Island night clubs
   closed as part of the larger refurbishment of Downtown Disney in order
   to make room for new shopping and dining offerings.

[[83]edit] Marketplace

   "Brickley" the sea monster outside the LEGO Imagination Center

   Formerly known as the Disney Village Marketplace, the area contains
   many shops and quick service restaurants. Restaurants include
   [84]Ghirardelli Soda Fountain & Chocolate Shop, and [85]Rainforest
   Cafe. Shopping venues include the [86]LEGO Imagination Center, Goofy's
   Candy Company, [87]World of Disney, Once Upon A Toy, and Cap'n Jack's
   Marina offering boat rentals.

[[88]edit] Fulton's Crab House

   Fulton's Crab House is a [89]riverboat [90]restaurant at [91]Walt
   Disney World's Marketplace shopping complex. Formerly, the [92]Empress
   Lilly. Run by the [93]Levy Restaurants company, their head chef is
   Frank Walason.

[[94]edit] History

   The Empress Lilly is a 220 by 62 foot static replica [95]Paddle steamer
   [96]riverboat on Village Lake in [97]Lake Buena Vista, Florida. In
   reality, the Lilly couldn't go anywhere. She was not a boat at all, but
   a large boat-shaped building, erected on the edge of the lake. A
   submerged concrete foundation gave the Lilly the stability to weather a
   [98]hurricane. Built for the [99]Walt Disney World Resort in 1976, the
   ship contained three restaurants and a [100]jazz lounge. She greeted
   guests for the first time on [101]May 1, [102]1977, when [103]Lillian
   Disney, [104]Walt Disney's widow for whom the ship is named, christened
   the ship. The Lilly was designed by [105]Walt Disney Imagineering to be
   as true to the eye as possible. The gingerbread scrollwork and stained
   glass detailing gave the ship an authentic feeling, harkening back to
   the days of [106]Mark Twain's [107]Mississippi River. The paddle wheel
   at the aft end of the ship churned constantly, though the ship never
   went anywhere. The Empress Lilly was one of the first locations of the
   now famous Disney Character Breakfast.

   Baton Rouge Lounge was located forward on the main deck. Here is where
   patrons could spend some time relaxing at the bar, and enjoying the
   musical sounds of the Riverboat Rascals. Many of these musicians played
   in the Baton Rouge for years, and became local legends. Some of the
   players who have played with the Riverboat Rascals were [108]Fast Eddie
   Erickson, [109]Dave Tobiasen, [110]Tom Bucci, [111]Denny Zavett,
   [112]Ralf Reynolds, [113]Mike Gentry, [114]Randy Morris, [115]Dan
   Riley, [116]John Charles and [117]Bill Dendle.

   Steerman's Quarters was located in the aft section of the [118]Main
   Deck. It specialized in certified Angus beef entrees. The dcor focused
   on imagery from America's western cattle nostalgia. In the aft end of
   the room, giant windows revealed the churning paddlewheel, nearby.

   Fisherman's Deck was located forward on the [119]Promenade Deck. As its
   name implies, this was a seafood restaurant.

   Empress Room was located aft on the Promenade Deck. This was a formal
   dining establishment, requiring reservations in advance. The room was
   extravagantly decorated, with gold trimmed walls and [120]Rococo (Louis
   XIV) style flourishes. Hungarian Chef, [121]Garry Reich, developed the
   original menu, to cater to upscale tastes.

   Jenny, the shrimping boat used in the movie [122]Forrest Gump used to
   be located on the northwest corner of [123]Planet Hollywood in Downtown
   Disney (Florida)

   In the mid 1990s, Disney began finding outside management to take over
   many of its restaurants. As a cost cutting move, it was decided that
   the Empress Lilly would come under new management. [124]Levy
   Restaurants signed a contract to operate the ship for 20 years. On
   [125]April 22, [126]1995, the Empress Lilly served her last meals. The
   restaurant was closed, all interiors were ripped out, and a new dcor,
   for a single restaurant (not three) was put in place. In addition, the
   old smoke stacks and paddlewheel, which gave the Lilly some added
   authenticity, were removed due to rust and rot. They were not replaced.
   The restaurant reopened as Fulton's Crab House on [127]March 10,
   [128]1996.

[[129]edit] Earl of Sandwich

   Earl of Sandwich is a [130]restaurant [131]franchise based in
   [132]Orlando, [133]Florida, [134]United States. It was founded by the
   current [135]Earl of Sandwich, his younger son Orlando Montagu, and
   businessman [136]Robert Earl, founder of the [137]Planet Hollywood
   chain. Earl of Sandwich is actually the brainchild of Orlando, who is
   second in line behind his brother Luke Timothy Charles Montagu,
   Viscount Hinchingbrooke to the title of Earl of Sandwich. He and his
   father are direct descendants of the [138]4th Earl of Sandwich, who
   popularized the [139]sandwich in [140]Great Britain in the 18th
   century. The first restaurant was opened on [141]March 19, [142]2004,
   located in Downtown Disney Marketplace on the property of [143]Walt
   Disney World Resort outside of Orlando, Florida. Earl of Sandwich
   currently has franchising plans for all over the United States and the
   United Kingdom, including the [144]Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino
   in Las Vegas, Nevada. The first Earl of Sandwich franchise is open in
   Sugar Land, Texas, and is owned by [145]Nolan Ryan and [146]Roger
   Clemens.^[147][1]

[[148]edit] Pleasure Island

          Main article: [149]Pleasure Island (Walt Disney World Resort)

   Pleasure Island was primarily a nighttime entertainment complex with
   comedy and dance clubs. It included a 1930s Explorer's Club themed
   [150]Adventurer's Club, The Comedy Warehouse, 8TRAX featuring 70's &
   80's music, BET Soundstage, Motion, and Mannequins Dance Palace
   featuring a revolving dance floor and [151]trance music, [152]dance
   music & [153]techno. There is also the Raglan Road Irish Pub &
   Restaurant. The two comedy and four dance clubs on Pleasure Island
   permanently closed after the evening of September 27, 2008 and over two
   years will be converted to restaurants and shops that have not yet been
   announced.

[[154]edit] T-Rex Cafe

   A [155]T-Rex Cafe [156]dinosaur-theme restaurant, located in Pleasure
   Island and operated by [157]Landry's Restaurants, was built in 2008 in
   the area of a former valet parking traffic circle, adjacent to
   [158]McDonald's in the E parking lot. Groundbreaking ran behind
   schedule but finally occurred in October 2007. The restaurant opened in
   the fall of 2008.

[[159]edit] West Side

   The House of Blues on the West Side

   The Downtown Disney West Side is home to many full service restaurants,
   large stores, and entertainment venues. It includes a [160]Virgin
   Megastore, an [161]AMC 24-screen movie theater, [162]Cirque du Soleil -
   [163]La Nouba, the [164]House of Blues restaurant and show auditorium,
   the five floor [165]DisneyQuest "indoor theme park", [166]Planet
   Hollywood, the [167]Wolfgang Puck Caf, Bongos Cuban Caf, and other
   various shops and eateries.

   In 2006, the Raglan Road Irish-themed pub, restaurant and gift shop
   replaced the Pleasure Island Jazz Company club, and the main and hub
   stages on Pleasure Island were demolished in order to create a direct
   walking path and line of sight from Marketplace to West Side. A
   building formerly containing shops and a fast food restaurant is being
   renovated and will reopen with new shops and a new fast food
   restaurant.
