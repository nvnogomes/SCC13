   The Eastern Catholic Churches are autonomous (in Latin, [56]sui iuris)
   [57]particular Churches in [58]full [59]communion with the [60]Bishop
   of Rome the [61]Pope. They preserve the liturgical, theological and
   devotional traditions of the various [62]Eastern Christian Churches
   with which they are associated, and between which doctrinal differences
   exist, in particular between the [63]Eastern Orthodox Church,
   [64]Oriental Orthodoxy and the [65]Assyrian Church of the East.^[66][1]
   They thus vary with regard to forms of [67]liturgical worship,
   sacramental^[68][2] and canonical discipline, terminology, traditional
   prayers and practices of piety. But they recognize that their faith is
   not at variance with that of the other constituent Churches of the one
   [69]Catholic Church, including the [70]Latin or Western Church, all of
   which are of equal dignity.^[71][3] In particular, they recognize the
   [72]central role of the Bishop of Rome within the [73]College of
   Bishops. They preserve the special emphases and illuminations that
   [74]Eastern Christianity has developed over the centuries, some of
   which [75]Pope John Paul II illustrated in his apostolic letter
   Orientale Lumen of 2 May 1995.^[76][4]

   Most Eastern Catholic Churches have counterparts in other Eastern
   Churches, whether [77]Assyrian or [78]Oriental Orthodox, from whom they
   are separated by a number of theological concerns, or the [79]Eastern
   Orthodox Churches, from whom they are separated primarily by
   differences in understanding of the role of the Bishop of Rome within
   the College of Bishops.

   The Eastern Catholic Churches were located historically in Eastern
   Europe, the Asian Middle East, Northern Africa and India, but are now,
   because of migration, found also in Western Europe, the Americas and
   Oceania to the extent of forming full-scale ecclesiastical structures
   such as [80]eparchies, alongside the Latin dioceses. One country,
   [81]Eritrea, has only an [82]Eastern Catholic hierarchy, with no Latin
   structure.

   The terms Byzantine Catholics and Greek Catholic are used of those who
   belong to Churches that use the [83]Byzantine liturgical rite. The
   terms Oriental Catholic and Eastern Catholic include these, but are
   broader, since they also cover Catholics who follow the Alexandrian,
   Antiochian, Armenian and Chaldean liturgical traditions.

   The term Eastern Catholic Churches refers to 22 of the 23 autonomous
   particular Churches in communion with the Bishop of Rome. (Every
   diocese is a [161]particular Church, but not an autonomous one in the
   sense in which the word is applied to these 22 Churches.) They follow
   different Eastern Christian liturgical traditions: [162]Alexandrian,
   [163]Antiochian, [164]Armenian, [165]Byzantine and
   [166]Chaldean.^[167][5] Canonically, each Eastern Catholic Church is
   [168]sui iuris or autonomous with respect to other Catholic Churches,
   whether Eastern or Latin, though all accept the spiritual and juridical
   authority of the Pope. Thus a Maronite Catholic is normally subject
   only to a Maronite bishop, not, for example to a Ukrainian or Latin
   Catholic bishop. However, if in a country the members of some
   particular Church are so few that no hierarchy of their own has been
   established there, their spiritual care is entrusted to a bishop of
   another ritual Church. This holds also for Latin Catholics: in
   [169]Eritrea, they are placed in the care of bishops of the
   [170]Ethiopic Catholic Church. Theologically, all the particular
   Churches can be viewed as "sister Churches".^[171][6] According to the
   [172]Second Vatican Council these Eastern Churches, along with the
   larger [173]Latin Church share "equal dignity, so that none of them is
   superior to the others as regards rite and they enjoy the same rights
   and are under the same obligations, also in respect of preaching the
   Gospel to the whole world (cf. Mark 16:15) under the guidance of the
   Roman Pontiff."^[174][7]

   The Eastern Catholic Churches are in [175]full [176]communion of faith
   and of acceptance of authority of the See of Rome, but retain their
   distinctive [177]liturgical rites, laws and customs, traditional
   devotions and have their own theological emphases. Terminology may
   vary: for instance, diocese and eparchy, vicar general and
   [178]protosyncellus, [179]confirmation and [180]chrismation are
   respectively Western and Eastern terms for the same realities. The
   mysteries (sacraments) of baptism and chrismation are generally
   administered, according to the ancient tradition of the Church, one
   immediately after the other. Infants who are baptized and chrismated
   are also given the [181]Eucharist.^[182][8]

   The Eastern Catholic Churches are represented in the [183]Holy See and
   the [184]Roman Curia through the [185]Congregation for the Oriental
   Churches, which, as indicated on the Vatican website, "is made up of a
   Cardinal Prefect (who directs and represents it with the help of a
   Secretary) and 27 Cardinals, one Archbishop and 4 Bishops, designated
   by the Pope ad qui[n]quennium. Members by right are the Patriarchs and
   the Major Archbishops of the Oriental Churches and the President of the
   Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Unity among
   Christians."^[186][9]

[[187]edit] Terminology

   Eastern Catholics are in full communion with the Roman Pontiff, and in
   this sense are members of the Roman Catholic Church,^[188][10] but some
   feel they are not "Roman Catholics" in the narrower senses of that
   term, since they are not members of the local particular Church of Rome
   nor of the [189]Western or Latin Church, which uses the [190]Latin
   liturgical rites, among which the [191]Roman Rite is the most
   widespread.^[192][11] Other Eastern Catholics "are proud to call
   themselves Roman Catholics".^[193][12]

[[194]edit] "Rite"

   The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches defines the terms autonomous
   Church and rite: "A group of Christian faithful linked in accordance
   with the law by a hierarchy and expressly or tacitly recognized by the
   supreme authority of the Church as autonomous is in this Code called an
   autonomous Church" (canon 27);^[195][13] and "1. A rite is the
   liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary patrimony, culture
   and circumstances of history of a distinct people, by which its own
   manner of living the faith is manifested in each autonomous [sui iuris]
   Church. 2. The rites treated in this code, unless otherwise stated, are
   those which arise from the Alexandrian, Antiochene, Armenian, Chaldean
   and Constantinopolitan traditions" (canon 28)^[196][14] In the past,
   the Eastern Catholic Churches have sometimes been referred to as
   "Eastern Rites." The Second Vatican Council spoke of them as
   "particular Churches or rites."^[197][15] The older Latin Code of Canon
   Law, when speaking of the Eastern Churches, uses the terms "ritual
   Church"or "ritual Church sui iuris" (canons 111 and 112), and also
   speaks of "a subject of an Eastern rite"(canon 1015 2), "Ordinaries of
   another rite" (canon 450 1), "the faithful of a specific rite" (canon
   476), etc. The use of the term "rite" to refer to the Eastern Churches,
   and the Western, has now become rare, however. A publication of the
   National Catholic Council of Catholic Bishops explains: "We have been
   accustomed to speaking of the Latin (Roman or Western) Rite or the
   Eastern Rites to designate these different Churches. However, the
   Church's contemporary legislation as contained in the Code of Canon Law
   and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches makes it clear that we
   ought to speak, not of rites, but of Churches. Canon 112 of the Code of
   Canon Law uses the phrase 'autonomous ritual Churches' to designate the
   various Churches."^[198][16] A periodical of January 2006 declared:
   "The Eastern Churches are still mistakenly called 'Eastern-rite'
   Churches, a reference to their various liturgical histories. They are
   most properly called Eastern Churches, or Eastern Catholic
   Churches."^[199][17]

   Care must indeed be taken to distinguish differing meanings of the word
   "rite". Apart from its reference to the patrimony of a particular
   Church, the word has been and sometimes, even if rarely, is still used
   of the particular Church itself. Thus, the term Latin rite can refer
   either to the [200]Latin Church or to one or more of the [201]Latin
   liturgical rites, which include the majority [202]Roman Rite, but also
   the [203]Ambrosian Rite, the [204]Mozarabic Rite, and others.

[[205]edit] "Uniate"

   The term Uniat or Uniate is applied to those Eastern Catholic churches
   who were previously Eastern Orthodox churches, and to their members,
   primarily by Eastern Orthodox. The term is now considered to have a
   negative, even derogatory, connotation,^[206][18] though it was also
   historically used, even if less frequently, by Latin and Eastern
   Catholics, especially prior to the [207]Second Vatican
   Council.^[208][19] Official Catholic documents no longer use the term,
   due to its perceived negative overtones.^[209][20] According to Eastern
   Orthodox Professor John Erickson of St Vladimir's Theological Seminary,
   "The term 'uniate' itself, once used with pride in the Roman communion,
   had long since come to be considered as pejorative. 'Eastern Rite
   Catholic' also was no longer in vogue because it might suggest that the
   Catholics in question differed from Latins only in the externals of
   worship. The Second Vatican Council affirmed rather that Eastern
   Catholics constituted churches, whose vocation was to provide a bridge
   to the separated churches of the East."^[210][21]

   Most Eastern Catholic Churches arose when a group within an ancient
   Christian Church that was in disagreement with the see of Rome chose to
   enter into [212]full communion with that see. However, the
   [213]Maronite Church claims never to have been separated from Rome, and
   has no counterpart Orthodox Church out of [214]communion with the Pope.
   It is therefore inaccurate to refer to it as a "Uniate" Church. The
   [215]Italo-Albanian Catholic Church has also never been out of
   communion with Rome, but, unlike the Maronite Church, it uses the same
   [216]liturgical rite as the [217]Eastern Orthodox Churches. The
   [218]Syro-Malabar Church, based in [219]Kerala, India, also claims
   never to have been knowingly out of communion with Rome. Other
   Christians of Kerala, who were originally of the same East-Syrian
   tradition, passed instead to the West-Syrian tradition and now form
   part of [220]Oriental Orthodoxy (some from the Oriental Orthodox in
   India reunited with the Catholic Church in 1930 and became the
   [221]Syro-Malankara Catholic Church).

   The canon law that the Eastern Catholic Churches have in common has
   been codified in the 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.
   Within the [222]Roman Curia, the [223]dicastery that works with the
   Eastern Catholic Churches is the [224]Congregation for the Oriental
   Churches, which, by law, includes as members all Eastern Catholic
   patriarchs and major archbishops.

   All Catholics are subject to the [225]bishop of the eparchy or diocese
   (the local particular Church) to which they belong. They are also
   subject directly to the Pope, as is stated in canon 43 of the [226]Code
   of Canons of the Eastern Churches and canon 331 of the [227]Code of
   Canon Law. Most, but not all, Eastern Catholics are also directly
   subject to a [228]patriarch, [229]major archbishop/[230]Catholicos, or
   [231]metropolitan who has authority for all the bishops and the other
   faithful of the autonomous [232]particular Church (canons 56 and 151 of
   the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches).

[[233]edit] Supreme authority of the Church

   Under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, the Roman Pontiff
   (the Pope) enjoys supreme, full, immediate and universal ordinary power
   in the Church which he can always freely exercise.^[234][22] The full
   description is under Title 3, Canons 42 to 54 of the Code of Canons of
   the Eastern Churches.

[[235]edit] Eastern patriarchs and major archbishoprics

   The Catholic patriarchs and major archbishops derive their titles from
   the sees of [236]Alexandria (Copts), [237]Antioch (Syrians, Melkites,
   Maronites), [238]Babylonia (Chaldaeans), [239]Cilicia (Armenians),
   [240]Kyiv-[241]Halych (Ukrainians), [242]Ernakulam-[243]Angamaly
   (Syro-Malabars), [244]Trivandrum ([245]Syro-Malankaras), and
   [246]Fgra-Alba Iulia ([247]Romanians). The Eastern Churches, their
   leaders and synods are governed under Titles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9,
   respectively, under the Code of Canons of the Eastern
   Churches.^[248][23]^[249][24]

[[250]edit] Historical background

   An Eastern Catholic cemetery in northeastern Pennsylvania, where many
   Eastern Catholics settled in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

   Communion between Christian Churches has been broken over matters of
   faith, when each side accused the other of [251]heresy or departure
   from the true faith ([252]orthodoxy). Communion has been broken also
   because of disputes that do not involve matters of faith, as when there
   is disagreement about questions of authority or the legitimacy of the
   election of a particular bishop. In these latter cases, each side
   accuses the other of [253]schism, but not of heresy.

   Major breaches of communion:
    1. The Churches that accepted the teaching of the 431 [254]Council of
       Ephesus (which condemned the views of [255]Nestorius) classified as
       heretics those who rejected the Council's teaching. Those who
       accepted it lived mostly in the Roman Empire and classified
       themselves as orthodox; they considered the others, who lived
       mainly under Persian rule, as [256]Nestorian heretics. These had a
       period of great expansion in Asia. Monuments of their presence
       still exist in China. Now they are relatively few in numbers and
       are divided into three Churches, of which the [257]Chaldaean
       Church, which is in communion with Rome, is the most numerous,
       while the others have recently split between the [258]Assyrian
       Church of the East and the [259]Ancient Church of the East.
    2. Those who accepted the 451 [260]Council of Chalcedon similarly
       classified those who rejected it as [261]Monophysite heretics. The
       Churches that refused to accept the Council considered instead that
       it was they who were orthodox. The six present-day Churches that
       continue their tradition reject the description Monophysite,
       preferring instead [262]Miaphysite. They are often called, in
       English, [263]Oriental Orthodox Churches, to distinguish them from
       the [264]Eastern Orthodox Churches. This distinction, by which the
       words oriental and eastern, words that in themselves have exactly
       the same meaning, are used as labels for two different realities,
       is impossible in most other languages and is not universally
       accepted even in English. These churches are also referred to as
       pre-Chalcedonian or, now more rarely, as non-Chalcedonian or
       anti-Chalcedonian. In languages other than English, other means are
       used to distinguish the two families of Churches. Some reserve the
       term "Orthodox" for those that are here called "Eastern Orthodox"
       Churches, but members of what are then called "Oriental/Eastern
       Orthodox" Churches consider this unfair.
    3. The [265]East-West Schism came about in a context of cultural
       differences between the Greek-speaking East and the Latin-speaking
       West and of rivalry between the Churches in Rome, which claimed a
       primacy not merely of honour but also of authority, and in
       [266]Constantinople, which claimed parity with that in
       Rome.^[267][25] The rivalry and lack of comprehension gave rise to
       controversies, some of which appear already in the acts of the
       [268]Quinisext Council of 692. At the [269]Council of Florence
       (1431-1445), these controversies about Western theological
       elaborations and usages were identified as, chiefly, the insertion
       of "[270]Filioque" in the [271]Nicene Creed, the use of unleavened
       bread for the [272]Eucharist, [273]purgatory, and the authority of
       the Pope.^[274][26] The schism is conventionally dated to 1054,
       when the [275]Patriarch of Constantinople and the Papal Legate
       [276]Humbert of Mourmoutiers issued mutual [277]excommunications
       that have since been revoked. In spite of that event, both Churches
       continued for many years to maintain friendly relations and seemed
       to be unaware of any formal or final rupture.^[278][27] However,
       estrangement continued to grow. In 1190 [279]Theodore Balsamon,
       Patriarch of Antioch, declared that "no [280]Latin should be given
       communion unless he first declares that he will abstain from the
       doctrines and customs that separate him from us";^[281][28] and the
       sack of [282]Constantinople in 1204 by the participants in the
       [283]Fourth Crusade was seen as the West's ultimate outrage. By
       then, each side considered that the other no longer belonged to the
       Church that was orthodox and catholic. But with the passage of
       centuries, it became customary to refer to the Eastern side as the
       Orthodox Church and the Western as the Catholic Church, without
       either side thereby renouncing its claim to be the truly orthodox
       or the truly catholic Church. The Churches that sided with
       Constantinople are known collectively as the [284]Eastern Orthodox
       Churches. In each Church whose communion with the Church of Rome
       was broken by these three divisions, there arose, at various times,
       a group that considered it important to restore that communion. The
       see of Rome accepted them as they were: there was no question of
       requiring them to adopt the customs of the Latin Church.

   At a meeting in Balamand, Lebanon in June 1993, the Joint International
   Commission for the Theological Dialogue between the Roman Catholic
   Church and the Orthodox Church declared that these initiatives that
   "led to the union of certain communities with the See of Rome and
   brought with them, as a consequence, the breaking of communion with
   their Mother Churches of the East ... took place not without the
   interference of extra-ecclesial interests" (section 8 of the
   [285]document). Likewise, the Commission acknowledged that
   "unacceptable means" were used in attempts to force Eastern Catholics
   to return to the Orthodox Church (section 11). The missionary outlook
   and proselytism that accompanied the Unia (section 10), was recognized
   to be incompatible with the rediscovery of each other as "Sister
   Churches" (section 12). Thus, the Commission concluded that the
   "missionary apostolate ... which has been called 'uniatism', can no
   longer be accepted either as a method to be followed nor as a model of
   the unity our Churches are seeking (section 12).

   At the same time, the Commission stated:
     * 3) Concerning the Eastern Catholic Churches, it is clear that they,
       as part of the Catholic Communion, have the right to exist and to
       act in response to the spiritual needs of their faithful.
     * 16) The Oriental Catholic Churches who have desired to re-establish
       full communion with the See of Rome and have remained faithful to
       it, have the rights and obligations which are connected with this
       communion.

   As remarked earlier, the identity of the Maronite Church and of the
   Syro-Malabar Church is due to no such division within an Eastern
   Church.

   Eastern Catholic Churches make up 2% of the membership of the Catholic
   Church when compared to the Latin Rite which has over one billion
   members. The 2008 statistics collected by the CNEWA show that Syriac
   Christians make up 47% of Eastern Catholics and Byzantine Christians
   make up 46%. The largest particular church is the Ukrainian Greek
   Catholic Church with 25% and second largest is the Syro-Malabar at 23%.
   The majority of Syriac rite Christians (western or eastern) are
   Catholic.

[[286]edit] Historical issues of inter-rite transfer

[[287]edit] Orientalium Dignitas

   On 30 November 1894 [288]Pope Leo XIII issued the Apostolic
   Constitution Orientalium Dignitas, in which he says "that the ancient
   Eastern rites are a witness to the Apostolicity of the Catholic Church,
   that their diversity, consistent with unity of the faith, is itself a
   witness to the unity of the Church, that they add to her dignity and
   honour. He says that the Catholic Church does not possess one rite
   only, but that she embraces all the ancient rites of Chistendom; her
   unity consists not in a mechanical uniformity of all her parts, but on
   the contrary, in their variety, according in one principle and vivified
   by it."^[289][29]

   The Pope broadened from Melkite Catholics to all Eastern Catholics the
   prohibition in [290]Pope Benedict XIV's Constitution Demandatam or 24
   December 1743, declaring: "Any Latin rite missionary, whether of the
   secular or religious clergy, who induces with his advice or assistance
   any Eastern rite faithful to transfer to the Latin rite, will be
   deposed and excluded from his benefice in addition to the ipso facto
   suspension a divinis and other punishments that he will incur as
   imposed in the aforesaid Constitution Demandatam."^[291][30]

[[292]edit] Modern reforms

   Starting in 1964, a series of reforms have been issued concerning
   Eastern Catholic Churches that have corrected a number of past errors.
   The cause of those reforms were behaviors that had been building for
   quite some time, especially below the papal level.

   The lack of complete lasting effect of Pope Leo XIII's 1894 encyclical
   [293]Orientalium Dignitas even with latin clergy being rather firmly
   threatened to cease and desist from raiding believers from other rites
   (as the sui iuris Churches were called at the time) led to a gradual
   awakening to the need to overhaul the relationship between the churches
   of the East and the West. During this period, attempts at partial and
   total suppression led to schism in America. and difficulties
   everywhere. Separated Eastern Churches were not slow to issue "I told
   you so's". There was confusion as to the universality of the Churches
   of the East among Western clergy despite firm and repeated papal
   confirmation of these Churches universal character over the centuries.
   Vatican II brought the reform impulse to visible fruition. Several
   documents, both during and after Vatican II have led to significant
   reform and development within the Eastern Catholic Churches.

[[294]edit] Orientalium Ecclesiarum

          Main article: [295]Orientalium Ecclesiarum

   In the decree [296]Orientalium Ecclesiarum^[297][31] (21 November
   1964), dealing with the Churches of [298]Eastern Christianity, the
   [299]Second Vatican Council directed that the traditions of the Eastern
   Catholic Churches should be maintained. It declared that "it is the
   mind of the Catholic Church that each individual Church or Rite should
   retain its traditions whole and entire and likewise that it should
   adapt its way of life to the different needs of time and place"
   (section 2), and that they should all "preserve their legitimate
   liturgical rite and their established way of life, and ... these may
   not be altered except to obtain for themselves an organic improvement"
   (section 6; cf. 22). It confirmed and approved the ancient discipline
   of the sacraments existing in the Eastern Churches, as also the ritual
   practices connected with their celebration and administration, and
   declared its ardent desire that this should be re-established, if
   circumstances warranted (section 12). It applied this in particular to
   administration of [300]Confirmation by priests (section 13). It
   expressed the wish that, where the permanent [301]diaconate (ordination
   as deacons of men who are not intended afterwards to become priests)
   had fallen into disuse, it should be restored (section 17). Sections
   7-11 are devoted to the powers of the patriarchs and major archbishops
   of the Eastern Churches, whose rights and privileges, it says, should
   be re-established in accordance with the ancient tradition of each of
   the Churches and the decrees of the ecumenical councils, adapted
   somewhat to modern conditions. Where there is need, new patriarchates
   should be established either by an ecumenical council or by the Roman
   Pontiff.

[[302]edit] Lumen Gentium

   The Council's dogmatic constitution on the Church, [303]Lumen Gentium
   (21 November 1964) deals with the Eastern Catholic Churches in section
   23. Its states:

     By divine Providence it has come about that various churches,
     established in various places by the apostles and their successors,
     have in the course of time coalesced into several groups,
     organically united, which, preserving the unity of faith and the
     unique divine constitution of the universal Church, enjoy their own
     discipline, their own liturgical usage, and their own theological
     and spiritual heritage. Some of these churches, notably the ancient
     patriarchal churches, as parent-stocks of the Faith, so to speak,
     have begotten others as daughter churches, with which they are
     connected down to our own time by a close bond of charity in their
     sacramental life and in their mutual respect for their rights and
     duties.^[304][32] This variety of local churches with one common
     aspiration is splendid evidence of the catholicity of the undivided
     Church. In like manner the Episcopal bodies of today are in a
     position to render a manifold and fruitful assistance, so that this
     collegiate feeling may be put into practical application.

[[305]edit] Unitatis Redintegratio

   The decree [306]Unitatis Redintegratio (also of 21 November 1964) deals
   with the Eastern Catholic Churches in sections 14-17.

[[307]edit] Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches

   During the [308]First Vatican Council the need for a common code for
   the Eastern Churches was discussed, but no concrete action was taken.
   Only after the benefits of the 1917 Latin code were appreciated was a
   serious effort made to create a similar code for the Eastern Catholic
   Churches.^[309][33] This came to fruition with the promulgation in 1990
   of the [310]Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, which came into
   effect in 1991. It is a framework document that lays out the canons
   that are a consequence of the common patrimony of the Churches of the
   East: each individual sui iuris Church has its own canons, its own
   particular law, layered on top of this code.

[[311]edit] Instruction for Applying the Liturgical Prescriptions of the Code
of Canons of the Eastern Churches

   The [312]Instructions of 6 January 1996 are intended to bring together
   in one place the developments that took place in the previous texts.
   The 'Instruction' is "an expository expansion based upon the canons,
   with constant emphasis upon the preservation of Eastern liturgical
   traditions and a return to those usages whenever possible - certainly
   in preference to the usages of the [313]Latin church, however much some
   principles and norms of the [314]conciliar constitution on the
   [315]Roman rite, 'in the very nature of things, affect other [316]rites
   as well'."^[317][34] As the Instruction itself puts it:

     The liturgical laws valid for all the Eastern Churches are important
     because they provide the general orientation. However, being
     distributed among various texts, they risk remaining ignored, poorly
     coordinated and poorly interpreted. It seemed opportune, therefore,
     to gather them in a systematic whole, completing them with further
     clarification: thus, the intent of the Instruction, presented to the
     Eastern Churches which are in full communion with the Apostolic See,
     is to help them fully realize their own identity. The authoritative
     general directive of this Instruction, formulated to be implemented
     in Eastern celebrations and liturgical life, articulates itself in
     propositions of a juridical-pastoral nature, constantly taking
     initiative from a theological perspective.

   These modern developments were necessitated by a series of less than
   stellar initiatives in the past.

     These interventions felt the effects of the mentality and
     convictions of the times, according to which a certain subordination
     of the non-Latin liturgies was perceived toward the Latin-rite
     liturgy which was considered "[318]ritus praestantior." This
     attitude may have led to interventions in the Eastern liturgical
     texts which today, in light of theological studies and progress,
     have need of revision, in the sense of a return to ancestral
     traditions. The work of the commissions, nevertheless, availing
     themselves of the best experts of the times, succeeded in
     safeguarding a major part of the Eastern heritage, often defending
     it against aggressive initiatives and publishing precious editions
     of liturgical texts for numerous Eastern Churches. Today,
     particularly after the solemn declarations of the Apostolic Letter
     [319]Orientalium Dignitas by Leo XIII, after the creation of the
     still active special Commission for the liturgy within the
     Congregation for the Eastern Churches in 1931, and above all after
     the Second Vatican Council and the Apostolic Letter [320]Orientale
     Lumen^[321][35] by John Paul II, respect for the Eastern liturgies
     is an indisputable attitude and the Apostolic See can offer a more
     complete service to the Churches.

            Australia, Germany and Scandinavia, France, Brazil, Argentina
            (1595)

   Note: [378]Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics are not recognized as a
   [379]particular Church (cf. [380]canon 27 of the Code of Canons of the
   Eastern Churches). The majority of Eastern Catholic Christians in the
   [381]Georgian Republic worship under the form of the [382]Armenian
   liturgical rite.

   As is obvious from the above list, an individual autonomous particular
   Church may have distinct jurisdictions (local particular Churches) in
   several countries.

   The Ruthenian Catholic Church is organized in an exceptional way
   because of a constituent metropolia, the [383]Byzantine Catholic
   Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh, which is referred to also, but not
   officially, as the Byzantine Catholic Church in America. Canon law
   treats it as if it held the rank of an autonomous ("sui iuris")
   metropolitan particular Church because of the circumstances surrounding
   its 1969 erection as an ecclesiastical province.

   At that time, conditions in the [384]Rusyn homeland, known as
   Carpatho-Rus, admitted no other solution because the Byzantine Catholic
   Church had been forcibly suppressed by the Soviet authorities. When
   Communist rule ended, the Eparchy of Mukacheve (founded in 1771)
   re-emerged.

   It has some 320,000 adherents, greater than the number in the
   Pittsburgh metropolia. In addition, an apostolic exarchate established
   in 1996 for Catholics of Byzantine rite in the Czech Republic is
   classed as another part of the Ruthenian Catholic Church.

   On an [385]EWTN website the Apostolic Exarchate for Byzantine-rite
   Catholics in the Czech Republic is mentioned in a list of Eastern
   Churches, of which all the rest are autonomous particular Churches.
   This appears to be a mistake, since recognition within the Catholic
   Church of the autonomous status of a particular Church can only be
   granted by the Holy See (cf. canon 27 of the Code of Canons of the
   Eastern Churches), which instead classifies this Church as one of the
   constituent local particular Churches of the autonomous (sui iuris)
   Ruthenian Catholic Church.

[[386]edit] Byzantine-rite Catholics of Georgian nationality or descent

          Main article: [387]Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics

   Some have treated Byzantine-rite Catholics within the Georgian Catholic
   Church as a separate particular Church with a reunion date of either
   1861 or 1917. A study by Deacon Methodios Stadnik states: "The Georgian
   Byzantine Catholic Exarch, Fr. Shio Batmanishviii (sic), and two
   Georgian Catholic priests of the Latin rite were executed by the Soviet
   authorities in 1937 after having been held in captivity in Solovki
   prison and the northern gulags from 1923."^[388][36] In his book The
   Forgotten: Catholics of the Soviet Union Empire from Lenin through
   Stalin,^[389][37] Father Christopher Zugger writes: "By 1936, the
   Byzantine Catholic Church of Georgia had two communities, served by a
   bishop and four priests, with 8,000 believers", and he identifies the
   bishop as Shio Batmalashvili. The Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union
   mentions "the Catholic administrator for Georgia Shio Batmalashvili" as
   one of those who were executed as "anti-Soviet elements" in
   1937.^[390][38]

   The second of these sources calls Batmalashvili a bishop. The first is
   ambiguous, calling him an Exarch but giving him the title of Father.
   The third merely refers to him as "the Catholic administrator" without
   specifying whether he was a bishop or a priest and whether he was in
   charge of a Latin or a Byzantine-rite jurisdiction.

   If Batmalashvili was an Exarch, and not instead a bishop connected with
   the Latin [391]diocese of Tiraspol, which had its seat at [392]Saratov
   on the [393]Volga River, to which Georgian Catholics even of Byzantine
   rite belonged ^[394][39] this would mean that a Georgian Byzantine-Rite
   Catholic Church existed, even if only as a local particular Church.
   However, since the establishment of a new hierarchical jurisdiction
   must be published in the [395]Acta Apostolicae Sedis, and no mention of
   the erection of such a jurisdiction for Byzantine Georgian Catholics
   exists in that official gazette of the Holy See, the claim appears to
   be unfounded.

   The [396]Annuario Pontificio, which normally lists all the bishops of
   the Catholic Church, does not mention Batmalashvili in its editions of
   the 1930s. If indeed he was a bishop, he may then have been one of the
   priests secretly ordained bishops of titular sees for the service of
   the Church in the Soviet Union by French Jesuit Bishop [397]Michel
   d'Herbigny, who was head of the Pontifical Commission "Pro Russia" from
   1925 to 1934, and who perhaps were given exclusive jurisdiction for no
   particular area of the Soviet Union. In the circumstances then
   prevailing, the Holy See would have been incapable of and would not
   even have thought of setting up new dioceses or exarchates within the
   Soviet Union, especially not of Byzantine rite, since Byzantine-rite
   Catholics were being forced to become officially members of the
   [398]Russian Orthodox Church.

   Batmalashvili's name is not among those given in [399]Roman Catholic
   Regional Hierarchy as the four "underground" apostolic administrators
   (only one of whom appears to have been a bishop) for the four sections
   into which the diocese of Tiraspol was divided after the resignation in
   1930 of its already exiled last bishop, [400]Joseph Aloysius Kessler.
   This source gives Father Stefan Demurow as apostolic administrator of
   "Tbilisi and Georgia" and says he was executed in 1938. Other sources
   associate Father Demurow with [401]Azerbaijan and say that, rather than
   being executed, he died in a [402]Siberian [403]concentration
   camp.^[404][40]

   Until 1994, the annual publication Catholic Almanac used to go further,
   listing "Georgian" among the Byzantine Rites or autonomous particular
   Churches. Until corrected in 1995, it appears to have been making a
   mistake similar to that made on the equally unofficial EWTN site about
   the Czech Byzantine-rite Catholics.

   There was also a short-lived Byzantine Catholic movement among the
   ethnic Estonians in the Orthodox Church in Estonia during the inter-war
   period of the twentieth century, consisting of two to three parishes,
   not raised to the level of a local particular church with its own head.
   This group was liquidated by the Soviet regime and is now extinct.

[[405]edit] Biritual faculties

   While "clerics and members of institutes of consecrated life are bound
   to observe their own rite faithfully,"^[406][41] priests are
   occasionally given permission to celebrate the liturgy of a rite other
   than the priest's own rite, by what is known as a grant of "biritual
   faculties". The reason for this permission is usually the service of
   Catholics who have no priest of their own rite. Thus priests of the
   [407]Syro-Malabar Church working as missionaries in areas of India in
   which there were no structures of their own Church, were authorized,
   while remaining priests of the Syro-Malabar Church, to use the Roman
   Rite in those areas, and Latin-Rite priests are, after due preparation,
   given permission to use an Eastern rite for the service of members of
   an Eastern Catholic Church living in a country in which there are no
   priests of their own particular Church.

   The Pope, to whose pastoral guidance the individual Churches both
   Eastern and Western are all equally entrusted,^[408][42] can celebrate
   the liturgy according to any rite. However, because he is Bishop of
   Rome, he normally uses the [409]Roman Rite.

   For a just cause (especially in order to foster Christian love and
   manifest the unity between the different particular Churches) and with
   the permission of the local bishop, priests of different autonomous
   ritual Churches may concelebrate, using strictly, without admixture,
   the rite of the principal celebrant; it is preferable that each wears
   the vestments of his own rite.^[410][43] For this no indult of
   biritualism is required.

   Biritual faculties may concern not only clergy but also religious,
   enabling them to become members of an institute of an autonomous Church
   other than their own.^[411][44]

   The laity are obliged to foster an understanding and appreciation of
   their own rite, and are held to observe it everywhere unless something
   is excepted by the law.^[412][45] This does not forbid occasional or
   even, for a just cause, habitual participation in the liturgy of a
   different autonomous Church, Western or Eastern. The obligation of
   assisting at the Eucharist or, for members of some Eastern Churches, at
   Vespers, is satisfied wherever the liturgy is celebrated in a Catholic
   rite.^[413][46]

[[414]edit] Clerical celibacy

   church in [418]Preov, eastern [419]Slovakia. Another bishop stands to
   his immediate right (white [420]omophorion visible), and two married
   priests stand to the side (facing camera).

   Eastern and Western Christian churches have different traditions
   concerning [421]clerical celibacy. These differences and the resulting
   controversies have played a role in the relationship between the two
   groups in some Western countries.

   Most Eastern Churches distinguish between "monastic" and "non-monastic"
   clergy. [422]Monastics do not necessarily live as monks or in
   monasteries, but have spent at least part of their period of training
   in such a context. Their monastic vows include a vow of celibate
   chastity.

   Bishops are normally selected from the monastic clergy, and in most
   Eastern Churches a large percentage of priests and deacons also are
   celibate, while a portion of the clergy (typically, parish priests) may
   be married. If a future priest or deacon is to be married, his marriage
   must take place before ordination to the diaconate. While in some
   countries the marriage continues usually to be arranged by the
   families, cultural changes sometimes make it difficult for such
   seminarians to find women prepared to be the wife of a priest,
   necessitating a hiatus in the seminarians' studies.

   In countries where Eastern traditions prevail among Christians, a
   married clergy caused little controversy; but it aroused opposition in
   other countries to which Eastern Catholics immigrated. In response to
   requests from the Latin bishops of those countries, the [423]Sacred
   Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith set out rules in a letter
   of 2 May 1890 to [424]Franois-Marie-Benjamin Richard, the
   [425]Archbishop of Paris,^[426][47] which the Congregation applied on 1
   May 1897 to the United States,^[427][48] stating that only celibates or
   widowed priests coming without their children should be permitted in
   the United States. This rule was restated with special reference to
   Catholics of [428]Ruthenian Rite by the 1 March 1929 decree Cum data
   fuerit, which was renewed for a further ten years in 1939.
   Dissatisfaction by many Ruthenian Catholics in the United States gave
   rise to the [429]American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese. This rule
   was abolished with the promulgation of the Decree on the Catholic
   churches of the Eastern Rite; since then, married men have been
   ordained to the priesthood in the United States, and numerous married
   priests have come from eastern countries to serve parishes in the
   Americas.^[430][49]

   Some Eastern Catholic Churches have decided to adopt mandatory clerical
   celibacy, as in the Latin Church. They include the [431]Syriac Catholic
   Church, the [432]Syro-Malankara Catholic Church and the [433]Ethiopic
   Catholic Church.

   10. [453]^ Examples of the use of "Roman Catholic Church" by Popes,
       even when not addressing members of non-Catholic Churches, are the
       encyclicals [454]Divini illius Magistri and [455]Humani generis,
       and the talk by [456]Pope John Paul II at the general audience of
       26 June 1985 ([457]actual text in Italian, [458]Spanish
       translation) in which he treated "Roman Catholic Church " as
       synonymous with "Catholic Church". The term "Roman Catholic Church"
       is repeatedly used to refer to the whole Church in communion with
       the see of Rome, including Eastern Catholics, in official documents
       concerning dialogue between the Church as a whole (not just the
       Western part) and groups outside her fold. Examples of such
       documents can be found at the links on the Vatican website under
       the heading [459]Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.
       The [460]Holy See never uses "Roman Catholic Church" to refer only
       to the Western or Latin Church. In the [461]First Vatican Council's
       [462]Dogmatic Constitution de fide catholica, the phrase the Holy,
       Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Church (in Latin, Sancta catholica
       apostolica Romana ecclesia) also refers to something other than the
       Latin-Rite or Western Church.
   11. [463]^ Some Eastern Catholics who use the Byzantine liturgical rite
       and call themselves "Byzantine Catholics" deny that they are "Roman
       Catholics", using this word to mean either Catholics who use the
       [464]Roman Rite or perhaps the whole of the Western Church,
       including those parts that use the [465]Ambrosian Rite or other
       non-Roman liturgical rites: "We're Byzantine rite, which is
       Catholic, but not Roman Catholic" ([466]Ukrainian church pastor
       honored).

   13. [470]^ [471]Canon 27 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches
       In the original [472]Latin the word for autonomous is "sui iuris":
       Coetus christifidelium hierarchia ad normam iuris iunctus, quem ut
       sui iuris expresse vel tacite agnoscit suprema Ecclesiae
       auctoritas, vocatur in hoc Codice Ecclesia sui iuris

       Eastern Catholic Churches
   18. [481]^ See [482]"The Word 'Uniate'" from www.oca.org
   19. [483]^ The term was used by the [484]Holy See (e.g., in the [485]Ex
       Quo of [486]Pope Benedict XIV), available online at:
       [487]http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0247m.htm. The 1909
       [488]Catholic Encyclopedia consistently used the term "Uniat" to
       refer to Eastern Catholics, stating: "The Uniat Church is therefore
       really synonymous with Eastern Churches united to Rome, and Uniats
       is synonymous with Eastern Christians united with Rome. Available
       online at: [489]http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06752a.htm
   20. [490]^ "It should be mentioned that in the past the Eastern
       Catholic churches were often referred to as 'Uniate' churches.
       Since the term is now considered derogatory, it is no longer used."

       between the Greeks and Latins were in the doctrine (a) on the
