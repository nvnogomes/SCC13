   Due South is an award-winning [20]Canadian television police
   [21]comedy-drama created by [22]Paul Haggis and produced by Alliance
   Communications (now part of [23]Alliance Atlantis), first aired in
   1994. It followed the adventures of fictional [24]Royal Canadian
   Mounted Police officer [25]Constable [26]Benton Fraser and his
   [27]half-wolf companion, Diefenbaker, living and working in
   [28]Chicago. Fraser's methods, usually more sensitive and understanding
   than is typical for police work, gave the series a reputation for well
   rounded characters.

   Being overly polite, Fraser's probably best known short quotes were:
   'thank you kindly'; when he found himself in trouble an understated 'oh
   dear'; and when faced with contradictory circumstances from other
   characters an all knowing and eloquently stated 'understood'. Another
   humorous angle of the show was that his sidekick wolf, Diefenbaker,
   though deaf, could read lips.

[[50]edit] History

   Due South originally debuted as a made for [51]television movie aired
   on [52]CTV in Canada and [53]CBS in the [54]United States. After higher
   than anticipated ratings Due South was turned into a continuing drama
   series with its first season launching late in 1994. It was the first
   Canadian-made series to earn a prime time slot on a major US network.

   After the 24 episode first season CBS cancelled the series but due to
   the show's success in Canada and the United Kingdom the production
   company raised sufficient money for a second 18 episode season which
   ran from 1995 - 1996. The show was once again shown on CBS in late 1995
   (CBS ordered an additional five episodes but aired only four of them)
   but again in 1996 CBS refused to renew the series.

   After a one year hiatus CTV revived the series in 1997 with
   international investment (from the [55]BBC, [56]Pro Sieben AG in
   Germany, and the French company [57]TF1) and it ran for two further
   seasons until 1999. In the United States seasons three and four were
   packaged together as a single third (26 episode) season for
   [58]syndication. The post 1997 episodes could be considered a
   [59]spin-off from the original series but were in fact titled as Season
   Three and Season Four of the original series. Despite critical acclaim
   and a consistently warm reception by American audiences Due South never
   became a huge hit in the United States; however it was one of the
   highest rated regular series ever aired on a Canadian network and
   remains highly regarded and popular in the United Kingdom where it was
   aired on [60]BBC2 between 1996 and 2002 and on [61]ITV3 from 2006.

[[62]edit] Story overview

   Fraser, Diefenbaker & Vecchio

   The basic premise of the series centers on an [63]Royal Canadian
   Mounted Police (RCMP) [64]constable named [65]Benton Fraser ([66]Paul
   Gross) who travels to [67]Chicago to solve the murder of his father;
   this is how he first meets his soon-to-be partner, [68]Ray Vecchio
   ([69]David Marciano), a tough, streetwise cop. Accompanied by his
   half-wolf [70]Diefenbaker (who adopted Fraser after saving his life,
   and is deaf, but can read lips), the investigation leads Fraser to
   uncover a plot by a company building a dam that is slowly killing the
   environment. This leads to the dam being shut down and many people
   losing their jobs. He also implicates corrupt members of the RCMP in
   the affair. This along with the loss of so many peoples' jobs makes him
   [71]persona non grata in Canada, and he chooses to live in Chicago.
   This plot line is referred to repeatedly during the series, and from
   season 3 on he introduces himself to many by saying:

     I first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father
     and, for reasons which don't need exploring at this juncture, I have
     remained, attached as liaison to the Canadian consulate.

   Benton Fraser is the archetypal Mountie, dogged, polite, and
   compulsively truthful; the themes of the series often featured his
   rigid moral code being tested by the realities of Chicago life. A
   little more unusual is his encyclopedic knowledge of virtually
   everything, however obscure (this is attributed to his grandparents
   having been librarians), a range of uncanny abilities, most notably his
   ability to sniff and lick refuse from the streets to gain clues about
   crimes, the way he can fall into a dumpster or other waste heap and
   emerge looking like he was 'hand laundered,' and the way every woman he
   encounters falls madly in love with him, including his boss Margaret
   (Meg) Thatcher and Ray's sister Francesca; his total obliviousness to
   this, and the fact that he rarely pursues any of the offers the ladies
   extend to him, is part of his charm.

   The show falls somewhere between a cop show and a comedy show. Although
   superficially following the police drama format, the comedy derives
   from outrageous plots, the self-deprecating Canadian and the American
   [72]stereotypes, and the occasional fantasy elements such as the
   regular visits paid to the Mountie by his father's ghost, whose advice
   varies between observant and helpful, to so maddeningly useless that
   Benton is moved to ask 'Are there any psychologists in the afterlife?
   People who can help you?' The acting is played [73]deadpan by the
   actors. Much of the comedy, as well as setting much of the tone of the
   show, was provided by Fraser's supernormal detective ability. For
   instance, in one episode, Fraser tracks down a suspect by smelling the
   breath of a rat to detect which brand of cooked ribs it had been
   eating. Another recurring gag is Fraser standing guard outside the
   consulate, always with someone messing with him because they know he
   can't move or speak during this duty, or trying to talk to him because
   they don't understand that.

   Marciano, the original Ray, did not appear in the post-1997 episodes,
   save for the first and last episodes, but was replaced by [74]Callum
   Keith Rennie as [75]Stanley Raymond Kowalski, a detective who was under
   orders to impersonate Vecchio while the real Vecchio was undercover.
   Marciano did return for the series finale, in which Vecchio ran off to
   Florida with Kowalski's ex-wife. In the last episode, the ghost of
   Benton's father finally solves his wife's murder. With no further crime
   fighting advice to give, it's time for him to depart for good. The
   series ends with Benton and Kowalski in search of the graves of the
   [76]Franklin expedition. (This missing expedition to the far north is
   immortalized in Canadian folk song by [77]Stan Rogers: '[78]Northwest
   Passage', which Paul Gross sings in the episode.)

[[114]edit] Other notable appearances

   Both [115]Maria Bello (reporter Mackenzie King in Season 2 episode "One
   Good Man") and [116]Ryan Phillippe (Del Porter, the son of the getaway
   driver in Season 1 episode "Gift of the Wheelman") went on to star in
   films.

   [117]Amanda Tapping appeared in one episode working for a secret
   government organization looking for extra terrestrial life, and later
   went on to star in [118]Stargate SG1, a science fiction program about a
   secret government organization fighting aliens.

   [120]Jane Krakowski, who portrays [121]Jenna Maroney on NBC's comedy
   show [122]30 Rock, appeared in the Season 1 episode "An Invitation to

   [127]Teri Polo (Meet the Parents, as well as starring in "Aspen
   Extreme" with Gross) appeared in Season 1's "They Eat Horses, Don't
   They?"

[[128]edit] Diefenbaker

   Diefenbaker (Dief for short) is one of the major [129]characters. He is
   [130]part dog, part wolf,^[131][2] originally from northern
   [132]Canada, who now lives in [133]Chicago with his owner, [134]Fraser.
   He is named after former [135]Prime Minister of Canada [136]John George
   Diefenbaker. He has several puppies, two of whom are named Sunshine and
   Buster, by a husky named Maggie.^[137][3]

   Diefenbaker first met Fraser when the Mountie found him in an abandoned
   mine. Diefenbaker later pulled Fraser out of [138]Prince Rupert Sound,
   saving the Mountie's life, but also bursting the wolf's eardrums -
   which resulted in, according to Fraser, Diefenbaker's deafness. Whether
   Diefenbaker is actually deaf, and not just suffering from selective
   hearing, is up to the viewer. Diefenbaker is apparently able to read
   lips, in both [139]English and [140]Inuktitut. Diefenbaker has stayed
   with Fraser ever since and has gone wherever the Mountie is posted.

   Diefenbaker is extremely loyal to Fraser, if sometimes disobedient, and
   will attack someone if required to defend Fraser. He is usually quite
   laid back - for a wolf. Since moving to Chicago (for which Fraser's
   friend [141]Detective Ray Vecchio forged him a special "wolf permit"),
   Diefenbaker has developed a taste for junk food, much to Fraser's
   despair.

   The role of Diefenbaker was played in the pilot movie by a mixed breed
   named Newman, then in the rest of seasons 1 and 2 by a purebred
   [142]Siberian Husky named Lincoln.^[143][4] When the show was brought
   back for seasons 3 and 4, Lincoln was replaced by another purebred
   [144]Siberian Husky named Draco^[145][5], whose sister, Cinder, did
   most of his stunts.^[146][6] A variety of stunt dogs were used
   throughout the series, and fake dogs have also been used in some
   scenes.^[147][7] ^[148][8]

   Diefenbaker received the first fan mail for the series.^[149][9] Draco
   appeared on the officially licensed merchandise t-shirt of
   Diefenbaker.^[150][10]

   Naming this character after a famous Canadian particularly appeals to
   the Canadian audience of the series. Aniko Brodroghkozy asserts in an
   article in Hop on Pop:

     The only reason why the use of these names would be funny to
     Canadians was because such references would be unknown to Americans
     who Canadian viewers knew would be watching the show in the United
     States.^[151][11]

[[152]edit] Production

   Filming was mostly done in [153]Toronto, Ontario, which was used as a
   stand-in for Chicago. In many episodes a [154]Toronto Transit
   Commission bus can be seen to pass by in the background. In others,
   prominent city landmarks such as the [155]CN Tower and the [156]Union
   Station can be glimpsed.

[[157]edit] Soundtrack

   The producers of Due South sought to showcase various Canadian artists
   within the show's episodes, with many of the featured tracks eventually
   being released on to CD soundtrack. The original theme for the show was
   written and composed by [158]Jay Semko, after which, working with
   [159]Jack Lenz and [160]John McCarthy, he went on to score the first
   two seasons of Due South.^[161][12] In November 1996, the first album
   was released containing 17 tracks, one of which was an in-character
   [162]soliloquy by [163]Paul Gross on the subject of bravery, taken
   directly from the episode An Eye For an Eye.

   When the show returned for its third and fourth seasons Semko returned
   once again to complete the second soundtrack.^[164][12] The second
   soundtrack album was released in June 1998 containing 16 tracks from
   the final two seasons. Both albums are filled largely with the vocals
   used in the series; most of the incidental music has not yet been
   released on CD.

       (1998)

   The final scene of the series was set to [167]Stan Rogers'
   '[168]Northwest Passage', a classic Canadian [169]folk song which has
   been referred to as an unofficial Canadian anthem.^[170][13]

[[171]edit] Awards

   Over the four-season run of the series, Due South and its cast and crew
   earned a number of awards. Most significantly, the show earned 53
   [172]Gemini nominations, winning 15 in total, including Best Dramatic
   TV series three years running (1995-1997). Paul Gross won Best Actor in
   a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role two years running (1995-1996) and

[[174]edit] Cultural references

   The series was known for its extensive use of [175]in-jokes for
   character names. The characters who appeared over the course of the
   series included Dawn Charest (an allusion to both [176]Don Cherry,
   iconic ice hockey commentator, and [177]Jean Charest, who for most of
   the show's run was the leader of the [178]Progressive Conservative
   Party of Canada), an RCMP inspector named [179]Meg Thatcher (alluding
   to [180]Margaret Thatcher), Doctor Esther Pearson (an allusion to
   [181]Lester B. Pearson), newspaper reporter [182]Mackenzie King, and a
   trio of police agents named [183]Huey, Dewey and Louis (the "Dewey" was
   named [184]Thomas E. Dewey, alluding to the 1940s [185]New York
   governor and unsuccessful [186]U.S. Presidential candidate). As well,
   Stanley Kowalski's wife was, unsurprisingly, named [187]Stella. When
   Fraser was asked by an official for his mother's maiden name, he
   answered, [188]'Pinsent.' In the episode 'North', [189]Steve Smith
   appears as a ticket agent in a small Canadian airport playing a
   character reminiscent of [190]Red Green, Vecchio angrily calls him 'Mr.
   Funny-hat.' Finally, Fraser's pet [191]Diefenbaker is named for [192]a
   Canadian Prime Minister.

   The radio and television series [193]Sergeant Preston of the Yukon was
   an influence on writer [194]Paul Haggis;^[195][14] Diefenbaker's being
   named after a Prime Minister may be an allusion to Sergeant Preston's
   dog, who was named '[196]King.' There are also significant resemblances
   to [197]Corporal Carrot and the [198]werewolf [199]Angua of the
   [200]Ankh-Morpork [201]City Watch from [202]Terry Pratchett's
   [203]Discworld series.^[204][15]

   The names 'Fraser' and 'Frobisher' are references to Canadian
   explorers, both connected to the search for commercial passages to the
   Pacific. [205]Simon Fraser journeyed from the Rocky Mountains to the
   Pacific Ocean in 1808. However, the Fraser River (named after him)
   turned out to be unusable as a trade route. Sir [206]Martin Frobisher
   was a 16th Century explorer who attempted three voyages in search of a
   [207]Northwest Passage, but did not make it further than Northeastern
   [208]Canada.

[[209]edit] Published media

[[210]edit] Books

   Due South: The Official Companion by Geoff Tibballs was published in
   May 1998 containing basic information on the series and cast and brief
   episodes synopses up to the end of the third season. Another
   illustrated companion, Due South: The Official Guide by John A.
   Macdonald, was published in December 1998. It contains some interviews
   with the characters and bios of the cast.

   A number of paper-back novelizations of a selection of episodes by Tom
   McGregor were later published including, Death In The Wilderness based
   on the pilot movie, An Invitation to Romance based on the episodes An
   Invitation to Romance and Gift of the Wheelman, All The Queen's Horses
   based on All the Queen's Horses and Red, White or Blue, and Vaulting
   North based on North and Vault.

[[211]edit] Videos

   The pilot two-hour movie was originally released on [212]VHS in 1996,
   but individual episodes had been released prior to this throughout 1995
   on VHS with two episodes per tape. Finally, in 1998, the season three
   and the season four two-part finales were released. In November 2002,
   the Due South Giftset was released containing the pilot movie and
   episodes Mountie on the Bounty and Call of the Wild.

[[213]edit] DVDs

   In 2002, Alliance Atlantis began releasing the series on DVD, starting
   with the first season in Canada, followed by releases in the US. The
   final season was released in Canada in 2005, and part of the season
   three and four combination in the US. In the UK, the first season was
   released in January 2006,^[214][16] and the other seasons followed
   later that year, including some special features such as a new
   documentary Ride Forever. Note that the UK release entitled Due South:
   The Complete Third Series does in fact contain all 26 episodes from the
   third and fourth seasons. Note that the US DVDs are allegedly of poorer
   quality than the Canadian releases; the pilot episode is included on
   the first season Australian, UK and US release but on the third season
   Canadian release.^[215][17]

[[278]edit] Show information

   [280]relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or
   articles. (January 2008)
     * In the series pilot, Benton's RCMP uniform used fireman's buttons.

     * In episode 17, The Blue Line (Season 1), the sign on the arena
       reads 'Copps Coliseum', in [281]Hamilton, Ontario.

     * During the first two seasons, Benton Fraser's brown Service Dress
       tunic has two stars (service badges) on the upper left sleeve,
       indicating ten years' service with the [282]Royal Canadian Mounted
       Police, while his red serge tunic has three, indicating fifteen.

     * Episode 11, Season 1 leads Benton and Ray to a robbery of a
       National Guard armoury. As the 5-ton truck full of weapons is
       driving from the premises, a row of Canadian [283]Iltis, MLVW and
       LSVW trucks is seen. Along the same line, episode 11 of Season 2
       takes Ben and Ray to a US Army base near Roswell, Illinois. But as
       Ian MacDonald's tour bus crashes the gate and drives into the base,
       the vehicles are Canadian LSVWs, and the helicopter, a Canadian CH
       135.

     * In Season 2, episode 7 - Juliet is Bleeding, during Detective Louis
       Gardino's funeral, the Chicago Police Department's Honour Guard
       performs Canadian drill movements during the firing salute. Also,
       when the command 'Ready!' is given, the Guard already have their
       weapons at the 'present' position, and they did not re-cock their
       weapons between volleys, which they would have had to do were they
       firing blank rounds without a blank firing attachment. As well,
       Benton is wearing his Stetson hat while carrying the casket, which
       for a person as meticulous about detail as Fraser, seems highly
       unlikely, as the RCMP, following the British tradition, do not wear
       head dress while carrying caskets.

   In the Season 2 episode "North" Steve Smith is seen as he appears in
   The Red Green Show (Seasons 1 - 3 and 8 - 15) and The New Red Green
   Show (Seasons 4 - 7) of said series.
     * Three actors who have appeared in Due South, [284]Callum Keith
       Rennie, [285]Michael Hogan and [286]Matthew Bennett have appeared
       in the new [287]Battlestar Galactica as Leoben Conoy, Colonel Saul
       Tigh and Aaron Doral, respectively.

[[288]edit] References in other media

     * In the [289]MMORPG [290]City Of Heroes, budding superheroes can
       take missions from a 'Detective Frasenbaker', an apparently
       superhuman Mountie who moved to the fictional Paragon City while on
       the trail of his father's killers. Listening closely at the door of
       his temporary office will reveal the distinctive bark of a large
       dog. His presence is an [291]in-joke and artist's signature by
       Canadian developer and longtime fan Melissa Bianco (aka
       'War_Witch').
     * In the [292]Vinyl Cafe [293]story 'Cousin Dorothy', Dave's relative
       (albeit not technically his cousin) Dorothy comes to [294]Toronto
       from [295]England to attend a 'Friends of Due South' convention.
