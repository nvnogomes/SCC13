   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   Dr. Stephen C. Sillett (born [9]March 19, [10]1968) is a [11]botanist
   specializing in [12]old growth forest canopies. As the first scientist
   to enter the [13]redwood forest [14]canopy, he pioneered new methods
   for [15]climbing, exploring, and studying tall trees.^[16][1] Sillett
   has climbed many of the worlds tallest trees to study the plant and
   animal life residing in their crowns and is generally recognized as an
   authority on tall trees, especially redwoods ([17]Sequoia
   sempervirens). He is the first [18]Kenneth L. Fisher Chair in Redwood
   Forest [19]Ecology for the Department of [20]Biological Sciences at
   [21]Humboldt State University. He is featured in [22]Richard Prestons
   [23]New York Times best seller, [24]The Wild Trees, as well as in
   academic journals, general interest magazines, and nature television
   programs. He lives in [25]Arcata, California, with wife Marie Antoine,
   a [26]botanist and fellow forest canopy research
   scientist.^[27][2]^[28][3]

[[39]edit] Early and personal life

   Sillett was born [40]March 19, [41]1968 in [42]Harrisburg,
   Pennsylvania. He has a younger sister, Liana, and an older brother,
   Scott, who is also featured in The Wild Trees. Both Sillet brothers
   were inspired to pursue careers in science by their grandmother, Helen
   Poe Sillett, who was a bird enthusiast.^[43][4]

   His wife, Marie E. Antoine, a fellow botanist, lectures at Humboldt
   State University and assists Sillett in his field research. They were
   married on [44]December 8, [45]2001.

[[46]edit] Education

   Sillett studied [47]biology as an undergraduate to pursue his interest
   in botany, later refocusing on tall trees and [48]Lobaria a type of
   nitrogen-fixing [49]lichen associated with [50]old-growth forests in
   the [51]Pacific Northwest. He received his Bachelor of Arts from
   [52]Reed College in [53]Portland, Oregon in 1989 at the age of 21. He
   went on to receive a [54]Master of Science in Botany from the
   [55]University of Florida in 1991, and a [56]Doctor of Philosophy from
   [57]Oregon State University in 1995. He began teaching at Humboldt
   State University in 1996, where he dedicates much of his time to field
   study of not only coast redwood but also giant sequoia
   ([58]Sequoiadendron giganteum), Douglas-fir ([59]Pseudotsuga
   menziesii), Sitka spruce ([60]Picea sitchensis), and the tallest trees
   of the Southern Hemisphere, [61]Eucalyptus regnans and [62]E. globulus.
   He currently teaches courses in General Botany, Lichens and
   [63]Bryophytes, and Forest Canopy Ecology at Humboldt State
   University.^[64][3]

[[65]edit] Research

[[66]edit] Early research

   Sillett began [67]climbing Douglas-fir trees during his undergraduate
   years at Reed College. While working on his Masters, he studied a
   [68]cloud forest canopy in [69]Costa Rica, focusing on bryophytes
   inhabiting the emergent crowns of [70]Strangler Figs (Ficus
   tuerckheimii). His doctorate work focused on old-growth Douglas-fir
   forests in the [71]Cascade Mountains of western [72]Oregon. It was not
   until he began teaching at Humboldt State that he began climbing and
   studying redwood forests.^[73][4]

[[74]edit] Later research

   After moving to northwestern California, Sillett began studying
   old-growth redwood forests and the [75]biodiversity found in their
   canopies. Additionally, Sillett studies how water is transported up the
   tree in an effort to understand the limits to tree height. One of his
   chief interests is in determining the maximum attainable heights of the
   6 tallest tree species.^[76][4]

   To reach the canopies, he uses an arrow to set a climbing line, then
   ascends using a modified arborist-style safety swing involving ropes,
   leather harnesses, and pulleys. Once in the canopy, Sillett and his
   research crew move about in a style known as skywalking using motion
   [77]lanyards on a web of climbing ropes. To reach outlying branches,
   Sillett deploys a [78]Tyrolean traverse between adjacent trees.^[79][5]

   In addition to studying redwood canopies, Sillett studies other tall
   forests in the US, Canada, and Australia. He has climbed and measured
   the tallest of each of the six tallest trees species. Sillett and his
   team do not disclose precise locations of the worlds tallest trees.
   Sillett allows only students and research team members to climb with
   him, to maintain both the security of the trees and the safety of
   fellow researchers.^[80][6]

[[81]edit] Major accomplishments

     * Discovery of the redwood [82]Grove of Titans in 1998, accompanied
       by Michael Taylor. ^[83][4]
     * Sillett began climbing redwoods in 1987, becoming the first
       scientist to enter the old-growth redwood forest canopy.^[84][4]
     * He has climbed and measured the height of the tallest live-topped
       tree of each of the five tree species known to grow over 100 m (300
       ft) tall.^[85][7]
     * In 2006, Sillett measured and verified the redwood [86]Hyperion as
       the worlds tallest tree at 115.55 m (379.1 ft). Previous
       record-holder [87]Stratosphere Giant is 112.83 m (370.5
       ft).^[88][6]
     * Sillett is the first holder of the [89]Kenneth L. Fisher Chair in
       Redwood Forest Ecology at Humboldt State University. This is the
       worlds first and only endowed chair supporting the study of one
       tree species. The [90]endowment is designed to promote field
       research of redwood canopies.^[91][7]^[92][8]
     * Sillett, wife Marie Antoine, brother Scott, and other climbing and
       research companions including Michael Taylor and Chris Atkins are
       featured in Richard Prestons book The Wild Trees.^[93][4] The book
       details some notable climbs, including his first ascent into the
       crown of a tall redwood tree.
     * Silletts research has been published in a number of academic
       journals including [94]Nature, the [95]American Journal of Botany,
       Ecological Monographs, Ecological Applications, Bryologist,
       Northwest Science, and Madroo. His research has also been profiled
       in [96]The New Yorker (by Richard Preston),^[97][9]^[98][1]
       [99]Discover,^[100][10] [101]New Scientist,^[102][11] and
       [103]National Geographic.^[104][12]
     * Sillett has been profiled on nature television program such as
       National Geographics Wild Chronicles, [105]BBCs [106]Planet Earth,
       and [107]PBSs Oregon Field Guide.^[108][3]
     * Sillett was named Scholar of the Year at [109]Humboldt State
       University in 2006.^[110][13]

   In addition to being a Grantee to the [112]Save-the-Redwoods League,
   some of Silletts awards and acknowledgments include:
     * The William Sterling Sullivant Award for Best Bryophyte Paper
       (1995)
