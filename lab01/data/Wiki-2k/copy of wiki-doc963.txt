   Edward Oliver Wolcott (March 26, 1848 March 1, 1905) was a prominent
   [9]American politician during the 1890s, who served for 12 years as a
   [10]Senator from the state of [11]Colorado.

   A native of [12]Hampden County, Massachusetts, Wolcott moved to Ohio as
   a boy and served in the One Hundred and Fiftieth Regiment of the
   [13]Ohio Volunteer [14]Infantry during the [15]American Civil War. In
   1875, he graduated from [16]Harvard Law School and moved to Colorado
   where he set up a law practice.

   In 1879, Wolcott moved to [17]Denver, where he began his political
   career as a Colorado state senator (1879-1882). In 1889, he was chosen
   to represent Colorado in the U.S. Senate, as a member of the
   [18]Republican Party. He was reelected in 1895, and was an unsuccessful
   candidate for reelection in 1901, 1902 and 1903.

   While in [19]Washington, D.C., Wolcott was a leading advocate for the
   coinage of silver. In 1897, [20]President McKinley named him chairman
   of the commission sent to [21]Europe to report on international
   [22]bimetallism.[23]New International Encyclopedia He was a popular
   host and guest in Washington society. He was chairman of the Committee
   on [24]Civil Service (Fifty-first and Fifty-second Congresses), and
   Retrenchment Committee on Post Office and Post Roads (Fifty-fourth
   through Fifty-sixth Congresses).

   In 1901, Wolcott was denied renomination to the Senate, which ended his
   political career. He once again took up the practice of law in
   Colorado, and maintained that practice until his death (which happened
   while he was on vacation in [25]Monte Carlo).

   Wolcott's remains were cremated, and the ashes were interred at
   [26]Woodlawn Cemetery in [27]New York City.
