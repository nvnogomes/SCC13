   Doris Blackburn

   Doris Amelia Blackburn (18 September 1889 12 December 1970) was an
   [9]Australian activist and Member of Parliament.

   She was born Doris Amelia Hordern in [10]Melbourne, [11]Victoria, and
   became involved in women's rights and peace issues from a young age and
   served as the campaign secretary of [12]Vida Goldstein, the first woman
   to stand for election to federal parliament in Australia. She married
   [13]Maurice Blackburn, a fellow firebrand [14]socialist, in 1914 and
   spent their honeymoon organising anti-war and anti-[15]conscription
   campaigns.

   While her husband served at different times as a [16]Labor member of
   the [17]Victorian and [18]Federal parliaments, Blackburn continued to
   work on social issues, some of which brought her into conflict with the
   Labor Party (of which she too was a member) and following Maurice's
   expulsion from the party in 1937, Doris resigned from the ALP. Maurice
   continued to sit in parliament as an independent but lost his seat at
   the [19]1943 federal election to the official Labor candidate, and died
   the following year.

   Upset at Labor's treatment of her husband, Doris stood as an
   Independent Labour candidate for Maurice's old seat of [20]Bourke at
   the [21]1946 election, winning it and in doing so became only the
   second woman to be elected to the [22]Australian House of
   Representatives. In parliament Blackburn, who shared the cross benches
   with fellow former Labor member [23]Jack Lang^[24][1], championed
   similar issues to her late husband, gaining nationwide notoriety in
   1947 as the only MP to vote against the Atomic Energy Bill, and served
   as the national President of the Council for Civil Liberties. Following
   an electoral redistribution, her seat of [25]Bourke was abolished,
   leaving Blackburn to run for the newly established seat of [26]Wills,
   which she lost to the Labor Party.

   Blackburn continued to be active in social issues, serving as president
   of the [27]Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and
   co-founding, with [28]Douglas Nicholls, the [29]Aborigines Advancement
   League and the [30]Federal Council for Advancement of Aborigines and
   Torres Strait Islanders.

   Blackburn died in [31]Coburg, Victoria.
