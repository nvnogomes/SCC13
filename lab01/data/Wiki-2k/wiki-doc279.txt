     __________________________________________________________________

   In [14]journalism, a two-way is an informal style of reporting that
   involves a conversation between two people. The most common arrangement
   is for a reporter in the field to talk to the host of a news program.
   The two usually conduct the conversation as if this were the first time
   the information was being disclosed to the host. While this may be true
   for breaking news, more often the host has been briefed in advance
   about what information the reporter has to share, so that the host can
   ask questions which the reporter can easily and naturally answer.
