   Doxycycline ([44]INN) (pronounced [45]/dkssaklin/) is a member of the
   [46]tetracycline antibiotics group and is commonly used to treat a
   variety of [47]infections. Doxycycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline
   invented and clinically developed in the early 1960s by [48]Pfizer Inc.
   and marketed under the brand name Vibramycin. Vibramycin received FDA
   approval in 1967, becoming Pfizer's first once-a-day broad-spectrum
   antibiotic. Other brand names include Monodox, Microdox, Periostat,
   Vibra-Tabs, Doryx, Vibrox, Adoxa, Doxyhexal and Atridox (topical
   doxycycline hyclate for [49]Periodontitis).

[[58]edit] Indicated uses

          Main article: [59]tetracycline antibiotics

   Further information: [60]oxytetracycline

   As well as the general indications for all members of the
   [61]tetracycline antibiotics group, Doxycycline is frequently used to
   treat chronic [62]prostatitis, [63]sinusitis, [64]syphilis,
   [65]chlamydia, [66]pelvic inflammatory disease,^[67][1]^[68][2]
   [69]acne and [70]rosacea.^[71][3]^[72][4]
   Generic 100 mg doxycycline capsules

[[73]edit] Antiprotozoal

   It is used in prophylaxis against [74]malaria.

   It should not be used alone for initial treatment of malaria, even when
   the parasite is doxycyline-sensitive, because the antimalarial effect
   of doxycyline is delayed. This delay is related to its mechanism of
   action. Its mechanism of action against malaria is to specifically
   impair the progeny of the [75]apicoplast genes resulting in their
   abnormal cell division.^[76][5]

   It can be used in a treatment plan in combination with other agents,
   such as [77]quinine.^[78][6]

[[79]edit] Antibacterial

   It is used in the treatment and [80]prophylaxis of [81]Bacillus
   anthracis ([82]anthrax)

   It is also effective against [83]Yersinia pestis (the infectious agent
   of bubonic plague) and is prescribed for the treatment of [84]Lyme
   disease,^[85][7]^[86][8]^[87][9], [88]ehrlichiosis^[89][10]^[90][11]
   and [91]Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In fact, because doxycycline is
   one of the few medications shown to be effective in treating Rocky
   Mountain spotted fever (with the next best alternative being
   chloramphenicol), doxycycline is indicated even in use in children for
   this illness. Otherwise, doxycycline is not indicated in the use in
   children under the age of 8 years. Doxycycline, like other antibiotics,
   will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.

   When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the
   drug, doxycycline may be used to treat and prevent:
     * [92]Escherichia coli
     * [93]Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Aerobacter aerogenes)
     * [94]Lyme Disease, aka Lyme Borelliosis Complex (B. burgdorferi)
     * [95]folliculitis
     * [96]Acne
     * [97]Shigella species
     * [98]Acinetobacter species (formerly Mima species and Herellea
       species)
     * [99]Respiratory tract infections caused by [100]Haemophilus
       influenzae
     * Respiratory tract and [101]urinary tract infections
     * Upper respiratory infections caused by [102]Streptococcus
       pneumoniae (formerly Diplococcus pneumoniae)
     * [103]Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections

[[104]edit] Anthelmintic

   [105]Elephantiasis is a disease caused by a [106]nematode (worm)
   [107]Wuchereria bancrofti. It causes swollen limbs and genitals
   ([108]Filariasis) and affects over 120 million people in the world.
   Previous anti-nematode treatments have been limited by poor levels of
   effectiveness, drug side effects and high costs. Doxycycline was shown
   in 2003 to kill the symbiotic [109]Wolbachia bacteria upon which the
   nematodes are dependent.^[110][12] Field trials in 2005 showed that
   Doxycycline almost completely eliminates blood-borne filaria when given
   for an 8 week course.^[111][13]^[112][14]

[[113]edit] Cautions and side effects

   Cautions and side effects are similar to other members of the
   [114]tetracycline antibiotic group. However the 10% risk of
   [115]photosensitivity skin reactions is of particular importance for
   those intending long-term use for malaria prophylaxis because it can
   cause permanent sensitive and thin skin.

   Reports of [116]GERD have been cited with the use of doxycycline.

   Unlike some other members of the tetracycline group, it may be used in
   those with renal impairment.

   Previously, it was believed that doxycycline impairs the effectiveness
   of many types of [117]hormonal contraception due to [118]CYP450
   induction. Recent research has shown no significant loss of
   effectiveness in oral contraceptives while using most [119]tetracycline
   antibiotic (including doxycycline), although many physicians still
   recommend the use of barrier contraception for people taking the drug
   to prevent unwanted pregnancy.^[120][15]^[121][16]^[122][17]

   It should be taken with a full glass of water and patients should be
   upright for at least 30 minutes after administration to prevent
   irritation of the esophagus and stomach. Also, there is a slim risk of
   liver damage during prolonged use of the drug.^[123][18] It is also
   recommended that it be taken with a small meal of a non-dairy nature if
   upset stomach, nausea, or fatigue occurs.

   Doxycycline is not approved for use in children under the age of 8
   years for two reasons: 1) it can cause permanent yellowing or graying
   of the teeth, and 2), according to CDC patient information on
   doxycycline, it can inhibit bone growth in premature infants during the
   time the medication is taken; this last effect disappears when the
   doxycycline treatment is over. Specific exceptions are made for
   potentially fatal illnesses where the benefits outweigh the risks and
   there are few or no other alternatives, such as with Rocky Mountain
   spotted fever and anthrax. It should also not be used in pregnant and
   nursing women, as the drug can cause damage to a fetus and nursing
   child.

[[124]edit] Experimental applications

   At subantimicrobial doses, doxycycline is an inhibitor of [125]matrix
   metalloproteinases, and has been used in various experimental systems
   for this purpose; such as for recalcitrant [126]recurrent corneal
   erosions.^[127][19] Doxycycline has been used successfully in the
   treatment of one patient with [128]lymphangioleiomyomatosis, an
   otherwise progressive and fatal disease.^[129][20] Doxycyline has also
   been shown to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy (in mice), a deadly
   consequence of prolonged hypertension.^[130][21]

   Doxycycline is also used in "Tet-on" and "Tet-off" [131]tetracycline
   controlled transcriptional activation to regulate [132]transgene
   expression in organisms and [133]cell cultures.

   Other experimental applications include:
     * [134]Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE)^[135][22]
     * Infected animal bite wounds ([136]Pasteurella multocida,
       [137]Pasteurella pneumotropica)^[138][23]
     * [139]Rheumatoid arthritis^[140][24]^[141][25] and [142]reactive
       arthritis.
     * Chronic inflammatory [143]lung diseases ([144]panbronchiolitis,
       [145]asthma, [146]cystic fibrosis,
       [147]bronchitis)^[148][26]^[149][27]
     * [150]Sarcoidosis^[151][28]^[152][29]
     * Prevention of aortic aneurysm in people with [153]Marfan Syndrome.
     * [154]Multiple sclerosis^[155][30]
     * Meibomian Gland Dysfunction
     * Treatment of [156]filariasis and [157]onchocerciasis due to
       [158]filariae and [159]onchocercae generally harbouring
       endosybiotic [160]Wolbachia bacteria. Doxycycline kills the
       bacteria, and (by removal of the endosymbiotes) the nematodes.
