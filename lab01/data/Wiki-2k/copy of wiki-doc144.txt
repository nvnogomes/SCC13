   The Dominion Land Survey (DLS) is the method used to divide most of
   [11]Western Canada into one-square-mile sections for agricultural and
   other purposes. It is based on the layout of the [12]Public Land Survey
   System used in the [13]United States, but has several differences. The
   DLS is the dominant [14]survey method in the Prairie provinces, and it
   is also used in [15]British Columbia along the Railway Belt (near the
   main line of the [16]Canadian Pacific Railway), and in the Peace River
   Block in the northeast of the province. These regions were surveyed
   using the DLS with the consent of the British Columbian government,
   since unlike the Prairie provinces and Northwest Territories B.C.
   controlled its own public lands upon entering Confederation.

   The survey was begun [17]July 10, [18]1871, shortly after [19]Manitoba
   and the [20]Northwest Territories became part of Canada. Covering about
   800,000 square kilometres (309,000 sq mi), the survey system and its
   terminology are deeply ingrained in the rural culture of the Prairies.

   The most important northsouth lines of the survey are the meridians:
     * The First (or Principal) Meridian at 972728.41 west, just west of
       [21]Winnipeg, Manitoba.
     * The Second Meridian at 102 west, which forms the northern part of
       the [22]Manitoba[23]Saskatchewan boundary.
     * The Third Meridian at 106 west, near [24]Moose Jaw and [25]Prince
       Albert, Saskatchewan.
     * The Fourth Meridian at 110 west, which forms the
       Saskatchewan[26]Alberta boundary and bisects [27]Lloydminster.
     * The Fifth Meridian at 114 west, which runs through [28]Calgary,
       Alberta (Barlow Trail is built mostly on the meridian) and
       [29]Stony Plain, Alberta (48th Street).
     * The Sixth Meridian at 118 west, near [30]Grande Prairie, Alberta
       and [31]Revelstoke, British Columbia.
     * The Seventh Meridian at 122 west, between [32]Hope and
       [33]Vancouver, British Columbia.

   The Meridians were determined by painstaking survey observations and
   measurements, and in reference to other benchmarks on the continent,
   but were determined using 19th century technology. The only truly
   accurate benchmarks at that time were near the prime meridian in
   Europe. Benchmarks in other parts of the world had to be estimated by
   the positions of the sun and stars. Consequently, although they were
   remarkably accurate for the time, today they are known to be several
   hundred metres in error. Before the survey was even completed it was
   established that for the purposes of laws based on the survey, the
   results of the physical survey would take precedence over the
   theoretically correct position of the meridians. This precludes, for
   example any basis for a [34]boundary dispute between Alberta and
   Saskatchewan on account of surveying errors.

   The main eastwest lines are the base lines. The First Base Line is at
   [35]49 north, which forms much of the CanadaUnited States border in the
   West. Each subsequent base line is slightly more than 24 miles (about
   39 km) to the north of the previous one.

   Starting at each intersection of a meridian and a base line and working
   west (also working east of the First Meridian), nearly square
   [36]townships are surveyed, which are about six miles (9.8 km) in both
   northsouth and eastwest extent. There are two tiers of townships to the
   north and two tiers to the south of each base line.

   Because the east and west edges of townships (range lines) are
   meridians of [37]longitude, they converge towards the [38]North Pole.
   Therefore, the north edge of every township is slightly shorter than
   the south. Only along the base lines do townships have their nominal
   width from east to west. The two townships to the north of a base line
   gradually narrow as one moves north, and the two to the south gradually
   widen as one moves south. Halfway between two base lines,
   wider-than-nominal townships abut narrower-than-nominal townships. The
   east and west boundaries of these townships therefore do not align, and
   northsouth roads that follow the survey system have to jog to the east
   or west. These eastwest lines halfway between base lines are called
   correction lines.

   Townships are designated by their township number and range number.
   Township 1 is the first north of the First Base Line, and the numbers
   increase to the north. Range numbers recommence with Range 1 at each
   meridian and increase to the west (east of First Meridian they are
   numbered eastward). On maps, township numbers are marked in [39]Arabic
   numerals, but range numbers are often marked in [40]Roman numerals;
   however, in other contexts Arabic numerals are used for both.
   Individual townships are designated such as "Township 52, Range 25 west
   of the Fourth Meridian," abbreviated "52-25-W4." In Manitoba, the First
   Meridian is the only one used, so the abbreviations are even more
   terse, e.g., "3-1-W" and "24-2-E."

   A part of the Dominion Land Survey (convergence of meridians
   exaggerated). The shaded township is Township 17, Range 8 west of the
   Third Meridian.

   Every township is divided into thirty-six sections, each about one-mile
   (1.6 km) square. Sections are numbered within townships as follows
   (north at top):
31 32 33 34 35 36
30 29 28 27 26 25
19 20 21 22 23 24
18 17 16 15 14 13
 7  8  9 10 11 12
 6  5  4  3  2  1

   In turn, each section is divided into four quarter sections: southeast,
   southwest, northwest and northeast. This quarter-section description is
   primarily used by the agricultural industry. The full legal description
   of a particular quarter section is "the Northeast Quarter of Section
   20, Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian", abbreviated
   "NE-20-52-25-W4." A section may also be split into as many as 16 legal
   subdivisions (LSDs). LSDs are commonly used by the oil and gas industry
   as a precise way of locating wells, pipelines, and facilities. LSDs can
   be "quarter-quarter sections" (square land parcels roughly 1/4 mile on
   a side, comprising roughly 40 [42]acres or 16,200 m in area) - but this
   is not necessary. Many are other fractions of a section (a half-quarter
   section - roughly 80 [43]acres or 32,300 m in area is common.) LSDs may
   be square, rectangular, and occasionally even triangular. LSDs are
   numbered as follows (north at top):
13 14 15 16
12 11 10  9
 5  6  7  8
 4  3  2  1

   In order to fully understand how the townships, sections, 1/4 sections,
   and legal subdivisions were set out, one should refer to the "Manual of
   Instructions for the Survey of Dominion Lands" available for free from
   Natural Resources Canada Centre for Cadastral Management.

   Occasionally, resource companies assign further divisions within LSDs
   such as "A, B, C, D etc." for example, to distinguish between multiple
   sites within an LSD. These in no way constitute an official change to
   the Dominion land Survey system, but nonetheless often appear as part
   of the legal description.

   Between certain sections of a township run road allowances (but not all
   road allowances have had an actual road built on them). The road
   allowances add to the size of the township (they do not cut down the
   size of the sections): this is the reason base lines are not exactly
   24 miles (39 km) apart. In townships surveyed from 1871 to 1880 (most
   of southern Manitoba, part of southeastern Saskatchewan and a small
   region near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), there are 1.5-[44]chain-wide
   (30.2 m) road allowances surrounding every section. In townships
   surveyed from 1881 to the present, road allowances are reduced both in
   width and in number. They are one chain wide (20.12 m) and run
   northsouth between all sections; however, there are only three eastwest
   road allowances in each township, on the north side of sections 7 to
   12, 19 to 24 and 31 to 36. This results in a road allowance every mile
   going east-west, and a road allowance every two miles going
   north-south. This arrangement reduced land allocation for roads, but
   still provides road-access to every quarter-section.

   Certain sections of townships were reserved for special purposes:
     * As part of the deal that transferred [46]Rupert's Land from the
       [47]Hudson's Bay Company to Canada, the HBC retained five per cent
       of the "fertile belt" (south of the [48]North Saskatchewan and
       [49]Winnipeg rivers). Therefore Section 8 and three-quarters of
       Section 26 were assigned to the company. Additionally, the fourth
       quarter of Section 26 in townships whose numbers were divisible by
       five also belonged to the HBC in order to give the company exactly
       five per cent. Although the HBC sold all these sections long ago,
       they are still often locally called "the Bay section" today.
     * The odd-numbered sections (except 11 and 29) were often used for
       [50]railway land-grants. The Prairies could not be settled without
       railways, so the Dominion government habitually granted large
       tracts of land to railway companies as an incentive to build lines.
       Notably, the Canadian Pacific Railway was granted 25,000,000 acres
       (100,000 km^2) for the construction of its first line from Ontario
       to the Pacific. These sections are colloquially called CPR sections
       regardless of the railway they were originally granted to.
     * Sections 11 and 29 were school sections. When [51]school boards
       were formed, they gained title to these sections, which were then
       sold to fund the initial construction of schools. The rural school
       buildings were often as not located on school sections; frequently,
       land trades were made between landowners and the school for
       practical reasons.
     * The remaining quarter sections were available as homesteads under
       the provisions of the [52]Dominion Lands Act, the federal
       government's plan for settling the North-West. A homesteader paid a
       $10 fee for a quarter section of his choice. If after three years
       he had cultivated 30 acres (12 ha) and had built a house (often
       just a [53]sod house), he gained title to the quarter. Homesteads
       were available as late as the 1950s, but the bulk of the settlement
       of the Prairies was 1885 to 1914.

   Legal surveys conducted before and after the Dominion Land Survey grid
   was laid out often have their own legal descriptions and delineations.
   Early settlement lots still retain their own original legal
   descriptions, but often have townships superimposed over them for the
   sake of convenience or for certain tasks. Urban developments
   superimpose new survey lots and plans over the older section and
   township grid also.
