   E.V.O.: Search for Eden, originally released in [26]Japan as 46 Okunen
   Monogatari: Harukanaru Eden e (46 , lit. 4.6 Billion Year Story: To
   Distant Eden^[27]?), is an [28]action role-playing video game developed
   by [29]Almanic Corporation and published by [30]Enix for the [31]Super
   Nintendo Entertainment System. Initially released in 1992 for Japanese
   audiences, the game was translated and made available in North America
   in 1993 courtesy of Enix America Corp. Combining aspects of traditional
   [32]platforming video games with role-playing elements such as
   dialogue-driven story sequences and heavy character customization, the
   game involves the player navigating a creature through a number of
   side-scrolling levels while undergoing bodily [33]evolution to cope
   with ever-changing environments. The game is heavily based on Almanic's
   original title 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinka Ron released
   exclusively in Japan in 1990 for the [34]PC-9801 home computer.

   Spanning a period of several millennia, the game's story involves
   [35]Gaia, daughter of the sun and mystical embodiment of the Earth,
   guiding the player through five distinct geological periods of the
   planet's history. Beginning the game as a simple fish, the player must
   travel across the planet defeating enemies and gaining the strength to
   evolve into more powerful and complex organisms before eventually
   reaching earning a chance to enter the paradise realm of Eden, becoming
   Gaia's immortal partner. However, strange crystals with the ability to
   influence evolution are laden throughout the player's quest, with the
   mystery of their origin becoming a secondary factor to the story.

[[44]edit] Gameplay

   The player as an early [45]amphibian (bottom) during the game's second
   era

   E.V.O. is a side-scrolling [46]platformer-style action game where
   players must navigate a creature of their own design across a number of
   environments resembling Earth's past.^[47][1] The game is divided into
   five distinct geological periods: the [48]Devonian period ("The World
   Before Land"), the [49]Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of
   Land"), the [50]Jurassic period ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late
   [51]Paleogene era ("Ice Age"), and finally the early [52]Neogene period
   ("Early Man").^[53][2] While each era takes historical liberties with
   both its inhabitants and time frames, a player's choices for evolution
   are dependent on their current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies
   during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of
   Man.^[54][3] As a player progresses though each level, they encounter
   other organisms who must be confronted by biting or ramming them until
   they are defeated, leaving behind their meat which the player can
   consume to grant them "evolution points" used towards upgrading
   specific body parts.^[55][4] The body of the character controlled by
   the player is divided into eight sections which can be upgraded by
   spending evolution points which make them stronger as well as change
   their appearance. New abilities such as tail swings, greater jumping
   ability, and increased movement speed can also be obtained through
   evolution.^[56][3]

   During gameplay, the player will also encounter crystal that either
   display on-screen hints on how to play, grant large amounts of
   Evolution Points, or transform their character into a unique body for a
   limited time.^[57][5] As a player takes damage from enemy creatures,
   they may restore their health at any time by either consuming the meat
   of their foes, eating nearby plant life, or by undergoing selective
   evolution. At the end of each level, the player must face a stronger
   [58]boss character in order to progress, often requiring more effort to
   defeat than normal foe. If the player's character should lose all their
   health, they are then transported back to the game's map screen with a
   deduction of Evolution Points.^[59][6] The game utilizes a built-in
   battery back-up save system for storing game data. A player may record
   their progress directly to the cartridge to be continued at another
   time, as well as store up to fifty previously created creatures using
   the game's built-in "Book of Life" feature.^[60][6] Creatures stored in
   this index have the option to be recalled at any time when a player
   encounters special crystals during their quest.^[61][3]

[[62]edit] Story

   Exploring a level 3 [63]asteroid

   E.V.O. tells the saga of life's evolution on Earth, with a subtext of a
   [64]creation myth and poly-[65]Theistic Evolution. The player takes the
   role of one of many billions of life-forms created by Gaia, the
   nurturing and benevolent daughter of Sol, the Sun. Among the creatures
   known as "life," there is a competition to evolve, and the greatest
   life-form will eventually be granted the privilege of entering the
   Garden of Eden and becoming the husband and partner of Gaia. As the
   game progresses, it soon becomes apparent that some mysterious external
   force is interfering with evolution on Earth in a destructive manner.
   Strange crystals not native to Gaia appear across the planet, and
   creatures that eat the crystals are transformed into monstrously
   powerful beings that dominate all other life-forms, over-consume
   resources, and disrupt the flow of evolution. In each Age the player
   character is tasked with confronting the species transformed by the
   crystals and defeating them so that the evolution of life can continue
   on track.

   In the final Age, the Age of Eden, the player learns that a mysterious
   entity is controlling the world's other life-forms and sending them
   against the player. This entity turns out to be [66]Bolbox, a life-form
   that has evolved into a freakish and evil advanced being by consuming
   the crystals, believing itself to be the first human, but in reality it
   is a gigantic one-celled organism. In the game's final battle, the
   player and Bolbox fight to determine who will gain entry into Eden and
   become Gaia's partner. Bolbox is defeated, and the player joins Gaia in
   Eden and is granted the gift of intelligence. It is also revealed that
   the crystals were introduced to Earth by an advanced [67]civilization
   on [68]Mars, who misguidedly wished to help Earth by speeding its
   evolution with the crystals. Upon realizing the dangers the crystals
   create, the Martians decide to leave Earth alone and simply watch it
   until it becomes advanced enough to interact with Mars.

[[69]edit] Development

   Screenshot from 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinka Ron on the [70]NEC
   PC-9801. The game served as the model on which E.V.O. would be based.

   E.V.O. was developed by [71]Almanic Corporation in early 1992 under the
   Japanese title 46 Okunen Monogatari ~Harukanaru Eden e~ (literally,
   "4.6 Billion Year Story: To Distant Eden") and was headed by project
   director Takashi Yoneda, who had previously designed [72]Quintet's
   [73]Actraiser three years prior. The title was largely based on the
   company's earlier text-based adventure game 46 Okunen Monogatari ~The
   Shinka Ron~ (literally, "4.6 Billion Year Story: The Theory of
   Evolution"), released for the [74]NEC PC-9801 home computer in 1990,
   and carries over much the game's themes, designs, and story.^[75][7]
   Although the design staff had opted to give a [76]fantastic rather than
   scientific representation of evolutionary theories and planet
   development, the crew was assisted by teachers from local schools to
   provide information on geology and biology to the programmers.^[77][7]
   While some of the game's designers were similar to that of the original
   PC-9801 title, much of the staff for the Super Nintendo Entertainment
   System version was made up of a younger, less experienced crew, which
   Yoneda claims made things "interesting" during development.^[78][7]

   The North American version was translated and marketed by Enix America
   Corporation. While originally planned for a March 1993 release, the
   game was beset by last-minute delays for several months until the
   following June.^[79][8] The company would later hold a promotional
   contest where players could send in photographs of their favorite
   customized creatures for a chance to win a free Enix game.^[80][9]

[[81]edit] Audio

   The music for E.V.O. was composed by [82]Koichi Sugiyama who is most
   famous for his work on Enix's [83]Dragon Quest series. The game was his
   first composition for a 16-bit system, with each theme made to fit the
   imagery of a particular era, which director Takashi Yoneda claimed he
   was "quite passionate" about.^[84][10] In late 1992, select songs from
   the game were performed by the Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra during
   their second annual [85]Game Music Concert series in [86]Tokyo,
   Japan.^[87][11] Two of these songs, "Great Hymn of Nature, Earth" and
   "Sorrow" were made available on the Orchestra Game Music Concert 2
   album the following November.^[88][12] The following December, an
   official soundtrack for E.V.O. was released exclusively in Japan by
   Apollon Records.^[89][13] Like the soundtrack for the game's successor,
   rather than featuring the same instrumentation present in the game, the
   46 Okunen Monogatari Symphonic Synth Suite soundtrack was comprised of
   music re-recorded and arranged [90]Motoaki Takenouchi using a
   combination of [91]electronic keyboard synth and orchestra samples to
   re-create it on a more sophisticated format.

   [97]Game Rankings 76% (2 reviews)^[98][15]

   The game received mild but generally positive reviews during its
   initial release in North America. [99]GamePro magazine praised the
   game's originality and overall design but found fault with the visual
   presentation of the title, stating "although this game has an
   interesting concept, the sluggish game play and average graphics may
   make you return to the caves."^[100][14] The publication also found the
   background music lacking, stating that the game's compositions ranged
   from "soothing" to "annoying".^[101][14] [102]Nintendo Power also
   called attention to the game's ingenuity and theme, remarking that
   "[t]he idea of this game is great and the weird creatures you can
   evolve can be both bizarre and hilarious."^[103][8] However, the
   magazine felt that the game's representation of the concept of
   evolution was too fanciful, as well the process of obtaining power-up
   items being "tedious".^[104][8] Nintendo Power would later give the
   game an honorable mention during its "Top Titles of 1993" awards
   segment as one of the most innovative games of the year.^[105][16]
   Although not officially released in Europe, the game was covered in an
   import review by [106]Super Play Magazine UK in late 1993. Although the
   editors found the game's strategy components to be "top-notch", the
   rest of the game was regarded as "very mediocre", garnering only a 47%
   average score.^[107][17]

   More contemporary reviews of the game were largely positive. In his
   2001 collector's guide [108]Video Game Bible, author Andy Slaven called
   the game "wildly underrated (and highly original)".^[109][18]Jonathan
   Dunder of The Free Information Society gave the game five stars, citing
   it as a classic in gaming history although admitting that the gameplay
   can get somewhat repetitive.^[110][19] Justin Holmes of AllRPG called
   it an RPG that's a little more engaging than most" and "very original
   both in concept and gameplay.^[111][20] In February 2007, [112]IGN
   ranked E.V.O. second in its list of the greatest "Prehistoric Games" of
   all time, stating that "[n]o other title before or since has so
   effectively captured the essence of evolutionary theory in videogame
   form."^[113][21] The website additionally likened the title to the
   then-upcoming and highly-anticipated [114]Spore by [115]Maxis Games,
   calling E.V.O. the "original success story" in life-simulation gaming
   and the standard for which it would be judged.^[116][21] The game
   maintains a 76% average score on aggregate review website [117]Game
   Rankings.^[118][15]

   In November 2008, [119]Philip M. Parker, Chair Professor at [120]INSEAD
   and editor of [121]Webster's Online Dictionary, referenced E.V.O. in
   his book, Crystalloids: Webster's Quotations, Facts and Phrases, as a
   subject in popular culture that includes [122]crystalloids as a running
   theme, citing the game's fantasy play mechanic of using the objects to
   induce evolution.^[123][22] The book also erroneously lists the 2001
   board game [124]Evo: The Last Gasp of the Dinosaurs as being related to
   the title.^[125][22]
