Ed Masterson

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Ed Masterson ([9]September 22, [10]1852 [11]April 9, [12]1878) was a
   [13]lawman and the brother of old west personality and [14]gunfighter
   [15]Bat Masterson, as well as [16]James Masterson.

[[17]edit] Lawman career

   Ed Masterson was born in [18]Henryville, Quebec. His family moved to
   near [19]Wichita, Kansas in the early 1870s. Ed Masterson, as reported
   by those who knew him^[[20]who?], never possessed the characteristic
   personality of his more famous brother, Bat, or his other brother
   James.^[[21]citation needed] He was killed by gunfire while trying to
   disarm a drunken cowboy.[22][1]

   Prior to beginning his lawman career, he and his two brothers worked as
   [23]Buffalo [24]hunters. During his service as the [25]marshal and
   Deputy Marshal of [26]Dodge City, Kansas, Ed Masterson was shot twice.
   The first incident occurred in November [27]1877, when he was shot in
   the breast by Bob Shaw in the Lone Star Dance Hall. Although his right
   arm was paralysed, Ed switched his gun to his left hand and shot Shaw
   in the arm and leg. After Masterson's recovery, he replaced Town
   Marshal Larry Deger as Marshal. It is commonly believed that he
   replaced lawman [28]Wyatt Earp, but it was actually Deger. On March
   15th, 1878, Masterson assisted his brother Bat, who was the [29]Ford
   County [30]Sheriff at that time, and lawman [31]Charlie Bassett in the
   capture of two train robbery suspects. [32][2]

   Later that same month, Masterson announced publicly that he had a new
   plan to rid Dodge City of vagrancy and street violence, which included
   the disarming of gun-carrying men inside the city limits, and that it
   would be implemented immediately. On April 9th, 1878, while attempting
   to disarm a drunken [33]cowboy, Jack Wagner, Ed was shot once in his
   right side. Bat Masterson, who was nearby, responded, running across
   the street shooting at both Wagner, and his employer Alf Walker. Ed
   Masterson died shortly thereafter, after walking into the street and
   collapsing. Wagner, hit in the abdomen, died the next day. Walker, hit
   in the lung and twice in the arm, was thought likely to die but was
   taken back to Texas and subsequently recovered. Witnesses who saw the
   killing of Ed Masterson report that it appeared he was carrying a
   rather pungent cigar in his hand. Actually it was the close range
   muzzle blast from Wagner's gun which had set Ed Masterson's clothes
   smoldering.

   There has been some debate as to whether Bat Masterson or Ed shot
   Wagner and Walker. The incident occurred at night and the local
   newspapers were ambiguous, perhaps trying to shield Bat from Texan
   vengeance, although Dodge City residents of the time generally knew
   that Bat had been responsible. In later years, the newspaper reports
   led some historians to conclude that Ed had shot his own attackers.
   However, the recent discovery of two court cases in which Bat testified
   that he had shot both men when it was hardly in his interests to do so
   means that it is now generally accepted that Bat avenged his brother.
   ^[34][1][35][3] [36][4]

   Masterson was replaced by Charlie Bassett as marshal, with Wyatt Earp,
   [37]James Earp, and Ed's brother Jim Masterson working as deputies. His
   brother Jim would later replace Bassett as marshal. Despite common
   belief, Wyatt Earp never served as the marshal of Dodge City.
