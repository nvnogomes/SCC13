[[21]edit] Early life

   He was the youngest son of Vice-Admiral [22]William Hamley, born at
   [23]Bodmin,[24]Cornwall, and entered the [25]Royal Artillery in 1843.

[[26]edit] Career

   He was promoted captain in 1850, and in 1851 went to [27]Gibraltar,
   where he began his literary career by contributing articles to
   magazines. He served throughout the [28]Crimean campaign as
   [29]aide-de-camp to Sir Richard Dacres, commanding the [30]artillery,
   taking part in all the operations with distinction, and becoming
   successively major and lieutenant-colonel by brevet. He also received
   the [31]CB and French and Turkish orders.

   During the war he contributed to [32]Blackwood's Magazine an admirable
   account of the progress of the campaign, which was afterwards
   republished. The combination in Hamley of literary and military ability
   secured for him in 1859 the professorship of military history at the
   new [33]Staff College at Sandhurst, from which in 1866 he went to the
   council of military education, returning in 1870 to the Staff College
   as commandant.

   From 1879 to 1881 he was British commissioner successively for the
   delimitation of the frontiers of the [34]Ottoman Empire and
   [35]Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire in Asia and the [36]Russian Empire, and
   Ottoman Empire and [37]Greece, and was rewarded with the [38]KCMG.
   Promoted colonel in 1863, he became a lieutenant-general in 1882, when
   he commanded the 2nd division of the expedition to Egypt under [39]Lord
   Wolseley, and led his troops in the [40]Battle of Tel el-Kebir, for
   which he received the [41]KCB, the thanks of parliament, and 2nd class
   of Osmanieh.

   Hamley considered that his services in [42]Egypt had been
   insufficiently recognized in Lord Wolseley's despatches, and expressed
   his indignation freely, but he had no sufficient ground for supposing
   that there was any intention to belittle his services.

[[43]edit] Later life

   From 1885 until his death on 12 August, 1893 he represented
   [44]Birkenhead in parliament in the [45]Conservative interest.

   Hamley is buried in [46]Brompton Cemetery, London.[47][1]

[[48]edit] Writings

   Hamley was a clever and versatile writer. His principal work, The
   Operations of War, published in 1867, became a text-book of military
   instruction. It was praised by the German Chief of Staff [49]Helmuth
   von Moltke, and until 1894 it was the sole text used in the entrance
   examination for the Camberley Staff College. He also published some
   pamphlets on national defence, was a frequent contributor to magazines,
   and the author of several novels, of which perhaps the best known is
   Lady Lee's Widowhood.

   Some of his contemporaries, many of them members of Wolseley's "ring"
   of confidantes, considered him too rigid or opinionated in his views.
   Field Marshal [50]Evelyn Wood wrote that "Hamley expected his students
   to accept his deductions as well as his facts, and did not encourage
   original research".
