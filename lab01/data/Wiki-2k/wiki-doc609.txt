   Shellac is an all-natural resin secreted by the female [10]lac bug to
   form a cocoon, on trees in the forests of [11]India and
   [12]Thailand.^[13][1]. It is processed and sold as dry flakes (pictured
   at right), which are dissolved in [14]denatured alcohol to make liquid
   shellac, which is used as a brush-on colorant, food glaze^[15][2] and
   wood finish much like a combination of stain and polyurethane. Shellac
   functions as a tough all-natural primer, sanding sealer,
   tannin-blocker, odor-blocker, stain (pigment), and high-gloss varnish.
   Shellac was also once used in electrical applications as it possesses
   good insulation qualities and it seals out moisture.

   Because dried shellac is all-natural and hypoallergenic (it can
   actually be eaten and is often used as a candy and pill coating), it is
   an excellent product for use around children, chemically-sensitive or
   allergic individuals, pets, and those concerned about toxins and
   chemicals in the home.^[[16]citation needed] It is also often the only
   historically-appropriate finish for early 20th-century hardwood floors,
   and wooden wall and ceiling paneling.

   From the time it replaced oil and wax finishes in the 1800s, shellac
   was the dominant wood finish in the western world until it was replaced
   by [17]nitrocellulose lacquer in the 1920s and 1930s. It remained
   popular in [18]the Southern United States through the 1950s and 1960s.
   It continues to be a popular [19]candy glaze for pill shaped sweets
   such as [20]Skittles.

[[31]edit] Production

   Knotty pine pickwick paneling and a door and some trim finished with
   orange shellac, common in the United States in the mid-20th century.
   Shellac has a very warm glow; this wood was the light cream color of
   freshly-sawn unfinished pine prior to being shellacked. This wood was
   not stained before being shellacked; the shellac has an orange color
   and acts as a combination stain and varnish-like protectant.

   Shellac is scraped from the bark of the trees where the female lac bug,
   Laccifer (Tachardia) lacca Kerr, Order Homoptera, Family
   Coccidae^[32][3]deposits it to provide a sticky hold on the trunk. This
   bug or insect is in the same Family as the insect from which
   [33]Cochineal is obtained. The insects suck the sap of the tree and
   excrete "stick-lac" in an almost non stop manner. The least coloured
   Shellac is produced when the insects are parasitic upon the kursum
   tree, (Schleichera trijuga). The raw shellac, which contains bark
   shavings and lac bug parts, is placed in canvas tubes (much like long
   socks) and heated over a fire. This causes the shellac to liquefy, and
   it seeps out of the canvas leaving the bark and bug parts behind. The
   thick sticky shellac is then dried into a flat sheet and broken up into
   flakes when dried, or dried into "buttons" (pucks/cakes), and then
   bagged and sold. The end-user then mixes it with denatured alcohol
   on-site a few days prior to use in order to dissolve the flakes and
   make liquid shellac -- liquid shellac has a very limited shelf life
   (about 1 year), hence it is sold is dry form and then mixed prior to
   use. This is also why cans of liquid shellac sold in hardware stores
   are very clearly marked with the production (mixing) date on the top or
   bottom, so that the consumer can know whether the shellac inside is
   still good.

   The thickness (strength) of shellac is measured by the unit "pound
   cut", referring to the amount (in pounds) of shellac flakes dissolved
   in a gallon of denatured alcohol. For example: a 1-lb. cut (said as
   "one pound cut") of shellac is the strength obtained by dissolving one
   pound of shellac flakes in a gallon of alcohol. A 5-lb. cut is the
   strength of five pounds of shellac flakes dissolved in a gallon of
   alcohol. Most pre-mixed commercial preparations come at a 3-lb. cut.
   Multiple thin layers of shellac produce a significantly better end
   result than a few thick layers -- thick layers of shellac do not adhere
   to the substrate or to each other well, and thus can be peeled off with
   relative ease; in addition, thick shellac will fill in (and thus ruin)
   carved designs in wood and other substrates.

   Shellac naturally dries to a high-gloss sheen. For applications where a
   flatter (less shiny) sheen is desired, there is an additive called
   "Shellac Flat" which can be added after the shellac flakes are
   dissolved in denatured alcohol, prior to use (see photo at right).

   Shellac naturally contains a small amount of wax (3%-5% by volume),
   which comes from the lac bug. In some preparations, this wax is removed
   (the resulting product being called "dewaxed shellac"). This is done
   for applications where the shellac will be coated with something else
   (such as paint or varnish), so that the topcoat will be able to stick.
   Waxy (non-dewaxed) shellac appears milky in liquid form, but dries
   clear.

[[34]edit] Colors and availability

   Shellac comes in many warm colors, ranging from a very light blond
   ("platina") to a very dark brown ("garnet"), with all shades of brown
   and yellow and orange and red in between. The color is influenced by
   the sap of the tree the lac bug is living on, as well as the time of
   harvest. Historically, the most commonly-sold shellac is called "orange
   shellac", and was used extensively as a combination stain and
   protectant on wood paneling and cabinetry in the 20th-century (see
   photo at right).

   Shellac was once very common, being available any place paints or
   varnishes were sold (such as hardware stores). Cheaper, clear, more
   abrasion- and chemical-resistant items (such as polyurethane) have
   almost completely replaced it in the world of decorative residential
   wood finishing (such as for hardwood floors, wooden [35]wainscoting and
   plank paneling, and kitchen cabinets). Such things, however, must be
   applied over a stain if the user wants the wood colored; shellac wasn't
   applied over a stain, as it was orange/amber in color by itself, and so
   functioned as a combination stain and protective topcoat. These modern
   chemicals, while some come closer than others, can never completely
   replicate the warm, inviting glow that shellac lends to wood. "Wax over
   shellac" (an application of buffed-on paste wax over several coats of
   shellac) is often regarded as the most beautiful finish for hardwood
   floors.^[36][4]

   Shellac flakes are hard-to-find now. Some specialty woodworking shops
   offer it as a special-order item. There are a few specialty companies
   dedicated exclusively to it, such as [37][1]. [38]Zinsser offers a
   pre-mixed liquid preparation of waxy (non-dewaxed) shellac, in both
   "amber" (roughly Waxy Orange) and "clear" (roughly Waxy Platina), which
   is sold at Lowes and Home Depot.

[[39]edit] Properties

   A decorative medal made in France in early 20th century moulded from
   shellac compound, the same used for phonograph records of the period.

   Shellac is a natural [40]polymer and is chemically similar to synthetic
   polymers, and thus can be considered a natural form of [41]plastic. It
   can be turned into a moulding compound when mixed with [42]wood flour
   and moulded under heat and pressure methods, so it can also be
   classified as [43]thermoplastic.

   Shellac is [44]soluble in [45]alkaline solutions such as [46]ammonia,
   [47]sodium borate, [48]sodium carbonate, and [49]sodium hydroxide, and
   also in various [50]organic solvents. When dissolved in [51]alcohol
   blends containing ethanol and methanol, shellac yields a coating of
   superior durability and hardness.

   Upon mild hydrolysis Shellac gives a complex mix of aliphatic and
   alicyclic hydroxy-acids and their polymers which varies in exact
   composition depending upon the source of the shellac and the season of
   collection. The major component of the aliphatic component is
   [52]Aleuritic Acid, whereas the main alicyclic component is
   [53]Shellolic Acid.^[54][5]

[[55]edit] History

   The earliest record of shellac goes back 3000 years, but shellac is
   known to have been used earlier.^[56][6] At one point, an entire palace
   was built out of dried shellac.^[57][7]

   Shellac was in rare use as a dyestuff for as long as there was a trade
   with the [58]East Indies. Merrifield^[59][8] cites 1220 for the
   introduction of shellac as an artist's pigment in Spain. This isn't
   unreasonable, given that [60]lapis lazuli as [61]ultramarine pigment
   from Afghanistan was already being imported long before this.

   In areas where small caskets or [62]reliquaries were decorated, then a
   significant number of them were protected with shellac, and from an
   early period. Painting was done with egg [63]tempera over [64]gesso.
   Shellac was also used as an adhesive and sealer over inlay work, such
   as ivory or abalone inlay.

   The use of overall paint or varnish decoration on large pieces of
   furniture was first popularised in Venice (then later throughout
   Italy). There are a number of 13th century references to painted or
   varnished [65]cassone, often dowry cassone which were deliberately
   impressive as part of dynastic marriages. The definition of varnish is
   not always clear, but it seems to have been a [66]spirit varnish based
   on [67]gum benjamin or [68]mastic, both traded around the
   Mediterranean. At some time, shellac began to be used as well. An
   article from the [69]Journal of the American Institute of Conservation
   describes the use of infrared spectroscopy to identify a shellac
   coating on a 16th century cassone.^[70][9] This is also the period in
   history where "varnisher" was identified as a distinct trade, separate
   from both carpenter and artist.

   Another consumer of shellac is sealing wax. Woods' The Nature and
   Treatment of Wax and Shellac Seals^[71][10] discusses the various
   formulations, and the period when shellac started to be added to the
   previous beeswax recipes.

   The "period of widespread introduction" would seem to be around 1550 to
   1650, when it moves from being a rarity on highly decorated pieces to
   being a substance that's described in the standard texts of the day.

[[72]edit] Uses

   For a long time in the early- and mid-20th century, orange shellac was
   used as a one-product finish (combination stain and varnish-like
   topcoat) on decorative wood paneling used on walls and ceilings in
   homes (particularly in America). In this application, it lends an
   extremely warm, inviting, homey glow. In the [73]American South, use of
   knotty pine plank paneling covered with orange shellac was once as
   common in new construction as drywall is today. It was also often used
   on kitchen cabinets and hardwood floors, prior to the advent of
   polyurethane.

   It is the central element of the traditional "[74]French polish" method
   of [75]finishing furniture, and fine [76]viols and [77]guitars.

   Shellac was used from mid-19th century to produce small moulded goods
   like picture frames, boxes, toilet articles, jewelry, inkwells and even
   dental plates. Although advancement in [78]plastics have rendered
   shellac obsolete as a moulding compound, it remains popular for a
   number of other uses. In [79]dental technology, it is still
   occasionally used in the production of custom impression trays and
   (partial) denture production.

   It is used by many [80]cyclists as a protective and decorative coating
   for their [81]handlebar tape.^[82][11] Shellac is used as a hard-drying
   adhesive for tubular cycle tires, particularly for track
   racing^[83][12]^[84][13]

   Orange shellac is also the preferred adhesive for reattaching [85]ink
   sacs when restoring vintage [86]fountain pens.^[87][14]

   Until the advent of [88]vinyl in 1938, phonograph records were pressed
   from shellac compounds. This use was common until the 1950s, and
   continued into the 1970s in some non-Western countries.

   Sheets of [89]Braille were coated with shellac to help protect them
   from [90]wear due to being read by hand.

   Shellac is used as a binder in [91]Indian ink.

   Shellac was historically used as a protective coating on paintings.

   Shellac is edible and it is used as a [92]glazing agent on pills (see
   [93]excipients) and candies in the form of [94]pharmaceutical glaze
   (alternatively, confectioner's glaze). Because of its alkaline
   properties, shellac-coated pills may be used for a timed enteric or
   colonic release.^[95][15] It is also used to replace the natural wax of
   the [96]apple, which is removed during the cleaning process.^[97][16]
   When used for this purpose, it has the [98]food additive [99]E number
   E904. This coating may not be considered as [100]vegetarian as it may,
   and probably does, contain crushed insects. In the tablet manufacture
   trade, it is sometimes referred to as "beetlejuice" for this reason.

   Because it is compatible with most other finishes, shellac is also used
   as a barrier or primer coat on [101]wood to prevent the bleeding of
   [102]resin or [103]pigments into the final finish, or to prevent
   [104]wood stain from blotching.

   Shellac is an odor and stain blocker and so is often used as the base
   of "solves all problems" primers. Although its durability against
   abrasives and many common solvents is not very good, shellac provides
   an excellent barrier against water vapor penetration. Shellac based
   primers are an effective sealant to control odors associated with fire
   damage.

   Shellac was once used for fixing [105]inductor, motor, generator and
   [106]transformer windings, where it was applied directly to single
   layer windings as an alcoholic solution in much the same manner as it
   is applied to timber. For multilayer windings, the whole coil was
   submerged in the shellac solution and then removed, drained and placed
   in a warm place to allow the alcohol to evaporate, the shellac then
   holds the turns in place, provides extra insulation and prevents
   movement and vibration, reducing buzz and hum. In motors and generators
   it also provides a medium for transfer of forces generated my magnetic
   attraction and repulsion from the windings to the rotor or
   [107]armature. In more recent times synthetic resins, such as Glyptol,
   ([108]Glyptal), have been substituted for the shellac. Some
   applications use shellac mixed with other natural or synthetic resins,
   such as [109]pine resin or Phenol-Formaldehyde Resin, of which
   [110]Bakelite is the best known, for electrical use. Mixed with other
   resins, [111]Barium Sulfate, [112]Calcium Carbonate, [113]Zinc Sulfide,
   [114]Aluminum Oxide and/or Copper(II) Carbonate, ([115]Malachite),
   shellac forms a component of Heat Cured Capping Cement used to fasten
   the caps or bases to the bulbs of electric lamps.

   As a natural resin, shellac has similarities to other natural resins
   such as [116]Myrrh and [117]Frankincense.

[[118]edit] Trivia

     * It takes about 100,000 lac bugs to make 1 lb. of shellac
       flakes.^[119][17]
     * Shellac is UV-resistant, and does not darken as it ages (though the
       wood under it may do so on its own, as in the case of
       pine).^[120][18]
     * Shellac scratches less easily than lacquer, and damages areas can
       easily be touched-up with another coat of shellac (unlike with
       polyurethane) because the new coat melts itself into the existing
       coat(s).
