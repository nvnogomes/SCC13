   East(ern) Francia (Regnum Francorum orientalium), known variously as
   Francia Orientalis or the Kingdom of the East Franks, was the realm
   allotted to [44]Louis the German by the 843 [45]Treaty of Verdun. It is
   the precursor of the [46]Holy Roman Empire.

   treaties, East Francia shown in orange

   After the death of Emperor [47]Louis the Pious his sons divided the
   [48]Carolingian Empire of the [49]Franks by the Verdun treaty into
   East, [50]West, and [51]Middle Kingdoms. As all parts remained under
   the rule of the [52]Carolingian dynasty with Louis' eldest son
   [53]Lothair I (795-855) retaining the Imperial title, this agreement
   did not abolish the entity of Francia itself.

[[61]edit] Louis the German (843-876)

   In the course of the 817 Ordinatio Imperii Louis the German had already
   received the territory of the former [62]Bavarian stem duchy from his
   father and thereafter had assumed the title of a "King of Bavaria".
   After his accession to the throne he - unsuccessfully - attacked the
   neighbouring [63]Great Moravia and struggled with plundering
   [64]Vikings and [65]Magyars, though he managed to keep his artficial
   and backward realm between the [66]Rhine and [67]Elbe rivers together.
   When the son of his brother Lothair, [68]Lothair II of Lotharingia died
   in 869, he also received large parts of his kingdom ([69]Lotharii) west
   of the Rhine by the 870 [70]Treaty of Meerssen.

   Lothair's eldest son [71]Louis II of Italy, though nominally Emperor
   upon the death of his father, had failed to assure the Lotharingian
   heritage. When he died in 875, Louis and his younger half-brother King
   [72]Charles the Bald of West Francia quarrelled about the [73]Kingdom
   of Italy including [74]Burgundy and the Imperial crown. Both were
   inherited by Charles, backed by [75]Pope John VIII, ending the
   existence of Middle Francia.

[[76]edit] Louis' sons (876-887)

   Within East Francia four [77]stem duchies had (re-)developed:
   [78]Swabia ([79]Alamannia), [80]Franconia (the eastern part of former
   [81]Austrasia), [82]Saxony and Bavaria. In 865 Louis was forced by his
   sons to divide his realm along the boundaries of these duchies:
     * [83]Carloman (830-880) inherited Louis' original Kingdom of Bavaria
       and the adjacent eastern territories.
     * [84]Louis the Younger (835-882) received Saxony and Franconia. His
       territories were again significantly enlarged by the Meerssen
       treaty, however after the death of his father, his uncle Charles
       the Bald campaigned eastern Lotharingia. He was rejected by Louis
       the Younger at a 876 battle near [85]Andernach.
     * [86]Charles the Fat (839-888) became King of Alamannia.

   After the death of their father, Louis's sons ruled jointly. When
   Charles the Bald of West Francia died in 877, they again claimed the
   heritage of [87]Lothair I as well as the Imperial title from Charles'
   son [88]Louis the Stammerer. Practising upon the weakness of West
   Francia, Carloman became King of Italy while Louis the Younger invaded
   western Lotharingia, which in 880 Charles' grandsons [89]Louis III and
   [90]Carloman II had to cede to him.

   Carloman was hit by a stroke in 879 and incapacitated he gave Bavaria
   (including the [91]Margraviate of Carantania) to Louis the Younger,
   while Charles the Fat received the Italian crown. In this respect the
   successor of the Emperors [92]Lothair I and [93]Lothair II of Italy, he
   himself in 881 was crowned Emperor - as Charles III - by Pope John
   VIII, the former opponent of his father. Upon the death of Louis the
   Younger, Charles also became sole ruler of the entire East Frankish
   realm and in 884 was even appointed King of West Francia by the local
   nobility. His attempts to reunite all Francia however were increasingly
   affected by his mental decay. At the 887 [94]Reichstag at [95]Trebur he
   was finally forced to resign.

[[96]edit] Arnulf of Carinthia (887-899)

   The prime mover behind Charles' deposition was [97]Arnulf of Carinthia
   (850-899), an illegetimate son of Carloman, who had grown up in the
   Carantanian march of Bavaria. After the Bavarian kingdom had passed to
   his uncle Louis the Younger he assumed the title of a Duke of
   [98]Carinthia in 880. In 887 he inherited Bavaria and was elected King
   of East Francia, after which he approved the implementation of
   [99]Count Odo of Paris as West Frankish king.

   Meanwhile [100]Berengar, the [101]Margrave of Friuli had taken the
   opportunity to take the title of an Italian king, but had to submit
   himself to Arnulf, after the Carolingian had threatened to invade the
   country. Arnulf nevertheless was stuck in the ongoing conflict with the
   Vikings and in 891 Berengar's rival [102]Guy of Spoleto had declared
   himself King of Italy and even forced [103]Pope Stephen V to crown him
   as the new Emperor. King Arnulf however had no intention to relinquish
   his claims neither to the rule over Francia as a whole nor to the
   Imperial crown. After defeating the Norsemen at the 891 Battle of
   [104]Leuven, he campaigned Italy and in 896 was crowned Emperor by
   [105]Pope Formosus.

[[106]edit] Decline

   Arnulf's son [107]Louis the Child (893-911) followed his father as King
   of East Francia at the age of seven. While [108]Louis the Blind, the
   [109]King of Provence became King of Italy and even Emperor in 901,
   Louis the Child had to deal with the fierce feud between the
   [110]Babenberg dynasty and Duke [111]Conrad the Elder over the stem
   duchy of Franconia. The king, influenced by his councillors, had the
   Babenberg duke executed and appointed Conrad's son [112]Conrad the
   Younger Duke of Franconia in 906. Meanwhile East Francia was devastated
   several times by the troops of King [113]rpd of Hungary.

   Upon the early death of Louis, the male line of the East Frankish
   Carolingians became extinct. The election of Conrad the Younger of
   Franconia as King by the Dukes of Saxony, Bavaria and Swabia at the
   diet of [114]Forchheim on November 10, 911 was a decisive step away
   from Francia and toward a German kingdom, as instead of a member of the
   Carolingian dynasty, the East Frankish dukes chose one of their kind.
   King Conrad however did not prevail as primus inter pares and even lost
   Lotharingia to the Western Frankish kingdom. It was his successor
   [115]Henry the Fowler, who was able to enforce his royal overlordship
   against the dukes, whose duchies decomposed over the next centuries,
   recently Swabia after the end of the [116]Hohenstaufen dynasty in 1268.

[[117]edit] Succession

   The arisal of the Holy Roman Empire is taken to coincide with the rise
   of the [118]Ottonian dynasty of Henry. In consequence the Kingdom of
   East Francia would have lasted from 843 to the coronation of [119]Duke
   Henry I of Saxony in 919; though more commonly, the Holy Roman Empire
   is thought to begin with the Coronation of [120]Emperor Otto I in
   [121]Rome on February 2, 962 as a [122]translatio imperii from the
   Frankish Empire.

   From the 10th century, East Francia became also known as Regnum
   Teutonicum ("[123]Teutonic kingdom", "[124]Kingdom of Germany"), a term
   often used by the Papacy during the [125]Investiture Controversy,
   perhaps as a polemical tool by [126]Pope Gregory VII against the
   [127]Emperor Henry IV in the late eleventh century.^[128][1].
