   UFO is a British [26]television [27]science fiction series created by
   [28]Gerry Anderson and [29]Sylvia Anderson and produced by the
   Anderson's and [30]Lew Grade's [31]Century 21 Productions for Grade's
   [32]ITC Entertainment company. The Andersons had previously made a
   number of very successful [33]marionette-based children's science
   fiction series including [34]Stingray, [35]Thunderbirds, and
   [36]Captain Scarlet. They had also made one live-action science fiction
   movie, [37]Doppelgnger, also known as Journey to the Far Side of the
   Sun, and now felt ready to move into live-action television and aim at
   a more adult market.

   UFO was the Andersons' first totally live-action TV series. Despite the
   assumption of many TV station executives, the series was not aimed at
   children, but deliberately sought an older audience; many episodes
   featured adult themes such as adultery, divorce, and drug use.

   UFO first aired in the UK in 1970 and in US [38]syndication over the
   next two years. In all, 26 episodes, including the [39]pilot, were
   filmed over the course of more than a year, with a five-month
   production break caused by the ultimate closure of the [40]MGM-British
   Studios in [41]Borehamwood, where the show was initially made.

   An idiosyncrasy of the series is that the term "UFO" is pronounced as a
   word ("you-foh"), as suggested by the real-world originator of the term
   [42]Edward J. Ruppelt, and not as the more common "you-eff-oh". This is
   particularly true of the lead character, Ed Straker. Technically
   speaking the series title should properly be pronounced "you-foh" as
   well. However, the "you-foh" pronunciation was not consistently applied
   and some supporting characters use the more traditional form.

   In a sad coincidence, lead actors [43]Ed Bishop and [44]Michael
   Billington died in June 2005, within five days of each other.

[[81]edit] Plot overview

   A fan-made [82]CGI illustration of two aliens from the series.

   The show's basic premise is that in the near future a fictional version
   of 1980 (a date indicated in the opening credits) human beings are
   being covertly harvested for their organs by [83]aliens. The show's
   main cast of characters are members of a secret,
   high-technology-equipped international agency established to defend
   Earth and humanity against the mysterious aliens and learn more about
   them.

[[84]edit] UFOs

   The extraterrestrial spacecraft can readily cross the vast distances
   between their planet and ours, but are only large enough for one or two
   crew members. Their time on station is limited; UFOs can only survive
   for a couple of days in the [85]Earth's atmosphere before they heat up,
   deteriorate, and finally explode. The alien craft can survive for far
   longer underwater; one episode, "Reflections in the Water", deals with
   the discovery of a secret undersea alien base, which shows one UFO
   flying straight out of an extinct volcano, which Straker describes as
   "a back door to the Atlantic". A special underwater version of the
   standard UFO design is seen in "Sub Smash". In flight they are
   surrounded by horizontally-spinning vanes and emit a distinctive
   pulsing electronic whine that sounds like a Shoooe-Wheeeh! which you
   can hear at the link here: [86][1] (actually produced by series
   composer [87]Barry Gray, on an [88]Ondes Martenot). The craft is armed
   with a [89]laser-type weapon, but can be destroyed by conventional
   explosive warheads. The personal arms of the aliens resemble shiny
   assault rifles; these have a lower rate of fire than that used by
   [90]SHADO. Later episodes such as "The Cat With Ten Lives" show the
   aliens using other weapons, such as a small device which seemingly
   paralyses victims. This is presumably for organ and body harvesting
   purposes, since pilot Jim Regan's wife Jean is taken for her organs in
   that episode.

[[91]edit] Aliens

   Notably for science fiction, and uniquely for a television series, the
   alien race is never given a proper name, either by themselves or by
   human beings; they are simply referred to as "the aliens." Humanoid in
   appearance, the autopsy of the first alien captured reveals that they
   are harvesting organs from the bodies of abducted humans. Their faces
   are stained by the hue of a [92]green oxygenated liquid which is
   believed to cushion their lungs against the extreme [93]acceleration of
   interstellar flight; this liquid is contained in their space helmets.
   To protect their eyes the aliens wear opaque [94]sclera [95]contact
   lenses with small pinholes for vision. The show's opening sequence
   begins by showing the image, remarkable for its time, of the removal of
   one of these contact lenses from an obviously real eye with a pair of
   forceps although the [96]scleral lens is never shown actually in
   contact with the eye.

   No more than two of the aliens are seen at any one time. In the episode
   Ordeal, when Foster in an alien spacesuit is carried by two aliens, one
   of those two aliens is always off-screen if Foster is on-screen. This
   seems to show that the UFO series's producers had only two prop alien
   spacesuits.

   The prop alien spacesuits were made of red [97]lycra.

   At the start of production the alien spacesuits were ornamented with
   silvery chainlinking. Later this was replaced by silvery areas as in
   the image.

   The dark vertical bands on the sides of the helmets, in the real world
   are slits to let the actors breathe.

[[98]edit] SHADO

   To defend against the aliens, a secret organisation called SHADO
   (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation) is established.
   Operating behind the cover of the Harlington-Straker Studios [99]movie
   studio in England, SHADO is headed by Commander Ed Straker (played by
   [100]Ed Bishop), a former [101]United States Air Force Colonel and
   [102]astronaut who poses as the studio's chief executive.

   In reality, this was a cost-saving move by the producers the studio was
   the actual studio where the series was being filmed, originally the
   [103]MGM-British Studios, later [104]Pinewood Studios, although the
   Harlington-Straker studio office block seen throughout the series was
   actually Neptune House - a building at the former [105]British National
   Studios, in [106]Borehamwood, that were owned by [107]ATV. Pinewood's
   studio buildings and streetscapes were used extensively in later
   episodes, particularly "Timelash" and "Mindbender", the latter
   featuring scenes that actually showed the behind-the-scenes workings of
   the UFO sets when Straker briefly finds himself hallucinating that he
   is an actor on a TV series and all his SHADO colleagues are likewise
   actors.

   Typical of Anderson productions, the studio-as-cover idea was both
   practical and cost-effective for the production and provided a
   ready-made for the viewer's [108]suspension of disbelief. It removed
   the need to build an expensive exterior set for the SHADO base and
   combined that all-important "secret" cover (concealment and secrecy are
   always central themes in Anderson dramas) with the trademark ring of at
   least nominal plausibility. A studio was a business where unusual
   events and routines would not be remarkable or even noticed. Comings
   and goings at odd times, the movement of vehicles, equipment, people
   and materiel would not excite undue interest and could easily be
   explained away as "sets", "props", or "extras".

   Another Anderson [109]leitmotif was the concept of the mechanical
   conveyor e.g., the automatic boarding tubes of Stingray and the
   Thunderbird craft. In UFO, this appeared in the guise of Straker's
   "secret" office, which doubled as a lift (elevator) that takes him down
   to the SHADO control centre located beneath the studio. The pilots of
   the space interceptors slide down boarding chutes into their craft. The
   interceptors then rise from their hangar via elevating platforms to a
   launch pad disguised as a lunar crater.

[[110]edit] SHADO equipment

   SHADO has a variety of high-tech hardware and vehicles at its disposal
   to implement a layered defence of Earth. Early warning of alien attack
   would come from SID (Space Intruder Detector), a [111]computerised
   tracking [112]satellite that constantly scans for UFO incursions. The
   forward line of defense is Moonbase from which the three Lunar
   Interceptor spacecraft, carrying [113]nuclear [114]missiles, are
   launched. The second line of defense includes [115]SkyDiver, a
   [116]submarine mated with the submersible, undersea-launched Sky One
   [117]interceptor aircraft, which attack UFOs in Earth's atmosphere. The
   last line of defense is ground units including the armed, [118]IFV-like
   SHADO Mobiles, fitted with [119]caterpillar tracks. Special effects, as
   in all Anderson's marionette shows, were supervised by [120]Derek
   Meddings, while the vehicles were designed by Meddings and his
   assistant, [121]Michael Trim.

[[122]edit] The stories

   The show's concept was very dark for its time the basic premise was
   that the alien invaders were abducting humans to use as involuntary
   [123]organ transplant donors. A later episode, "The Cat with Ten
   Lives", contains a particularly sinister plot point which suggests that
   the UFO pilots are not humanoid aliens at all, but are in fact human
   abductees under the control of the alien intelligences. This suggests
   that the aliens may have no physical being themselves and therefore
   need a vehicle or container, meaning our human bodies, to incarnate.

   The show also featured realistic, believable relationships between the
   human characters to a far greater extent than usual in a typical
   science fiction series, showing the clear influence of American
   programmes like [124]The Twilight Zone and [125]Star Trek and British
   action series such as [126]Danger Man. One early episode, "Computer
   Affair", strongly hinted at an interracial romance between two
   continuing characters (something that was uncommon on British TV in
   those days), while others showed the heroes making mistakes with
   sometimes fatal consequences. Furthermore, relatively few episodes of
   the series actually had happy or (for the characters) satisfying
   endings.

   One especially dramatic episode "Confetti Check A-OK" is almost
   entirely devoted to the breakdown of Straker's marriage under the
   strain of maintaining his secret identity. Another, "A Question of
   Priorities" hinges on Straker having to make an agonising life-or-death
   choice to rescue his critically-injured son by diverting an aircraft
   carrying SHADO mobiles to deliver life-saving medical supplies, or to
   attempt a last-chance intercept against an incoming UFO. Interestingly,
   two key images from "A Question of Priorities", Straker's son being
   struck down and his ex declaring she never wants to see Straker again,
   are repeated in "Sub-Smash" and "Mindbender", suggested Straker remains
   haunted by unresolved emotions to the series end and perhaps beyond.

   Another episode "The Square Triangle" includes a plot by a woman and
   her lover to murder her husband. When they accidentally kill an alien
   from a downed UFO instead, SHADO intervenes and doses the guilty pair
   with amnesia drugs (decades ahead of a similar story device in [127]Men
   in Black, and one deployed for similar reasons). Straker realises,
   however, that the drugs will not affect their basic motivation. The end
   credits of this episode feature a very dark scene set in the future
   with the woman visiting her husband's grave, and then walking to meet
   her lover.

   Some critics complained that the emphasis on down-to-earth
   relationships weakened the show's science fiction premise and were also
   a means of saving money on special effects. The money-saving argument
   may have been true to a limited extent, but the Andersons made a virtue
   of necessity. They had always hoped to direct live action TV drama, and
   although the marionette shows helped them develop impressive skills in
   effects and scripting, they had always considered them as essentially
   being a way of keeping in work and earning money while they tried to
   break into "real" TV drama. Others countered that the characters were
   more well-rounded than in other science fiction shows and that science
   fiction concepts and special effects in themselves did not preclude
   realistic action and interaction and believable, emotionally engaging
   plots.

   UFO confused broadcasters in both Britain and the United States who
   could not decide if it was a programme for adults, or for children (the
   fact Anderson was primarily associated with children's programming did
   not help matters). This confusion coupled with erratic broadcasts are
   considered as contributing factors in its cancellation, although UFO is
   credited with opening the door to moderately successful runs of later
   live-action, adult-oriented programming by Anderson such as [128]The
   Protectors and [129]Space: 1999.

[[130]edit] Special effects

   The special effects, supervised by Derek Meddings, were of the highest
   quality and outstanding for their day, given the relatively limited
   resources at the team's disposal.

   In a refinement of the underwater effect developed for [131]Stingray,
   Meddings' team devised a disconcerting effect a double-walled visor for
   the alien space helmets which could be gradually filled from the bottom
   up with green-dyed water. When filmed from the appropriate angle it
   produced a very convincing illusion of the helmet filling up and
   submerging the wearer's head.

[[132]edit] Second series and Space:1999

   Two years after the 26 episodes were completed, the series was
   syndicated on American television and the ratings were initially
   promising enough to prompt ITC to commission a second season of UFO. As
   the Moon-based episodes appeared to have proven more popular than the
   Earth-based stories, ITC insisted that in the new season, the action
   would take place entirely on the Moon. Gerry Anderson proposed a format
   in which SHADO Moonbase had been greatly enlarged to become the
   organisation's main headquarters, and pre-production on UFO 2 began
   with extensive research and design for the new Moonbase. These
   developments were not without precedent in the earlier episodes: a
   subplot of "Kill Straker!" sees Straker negotiating with SHADO's
   financial supporters for funding to build more moonbases within 10
   years. However, ratings for the syndicated broadcasts in America
   dropped towards the end of the run and ITC got cold feet and cancelled
   the second season plans. Unwilling to let the UFO 2 pre-production work
   go to waste, Anderson instead offered ITC a new series idea, unrelated
   to UFO, in which the Moon would be blown out of Earth orbit taking the
   Moonbase survivors with it. This proposal developed into [133]Space:
   1999. When Space:1999 was broadcast there was no trace in its plot of
   the show which had been its precursor.

[[134]edit] Merchandise

   As with many Anderson productions, the series generated a range of
   merchandising toys based on the SHADO vehicles. The classic [135]Dinky
   die-cast range of vehicles featured robust yet finely-finished products
   and included Straker's futuristic gull-winged gas turbine car, the
   SHADO mobile and the missile-bearing Lunar Interceptor (though the
   Interceptor was released in a lurid metallic green finish unlike the
   original's white). Like the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet related
   models, the original Dinky toys are now prized collectors items. All
   the major vehicles, characters, and more have been produced in model
   form many times over by a large number of licencee companies; the
   Anderson shows and their merchandise have always had widespread
   popularity, but they are especially popular in Japan.

[[136]edit] DVD release

   The complete series was released on DVD in the UK and in North America
   in 2002 and in Australia in 2007. Bonus features include a commentary
   by Gerry Anderson on the pilot episode "Identified", and an actor's
   commentary by Ed Bishop on the episode "Sub-Smash". There are also some
   deleted scenes and lots of stills and publicity artwork.

[[137]edit] Characters

   UFO had a large ensemble cast, and many of its members would come and
   go during the course of the series, with a number of actors most
   notably George Sewell and Gabrielle Drake leaving the series during the
   production break that occurred when the series had to change studios
   midway through production. It is established early on that SHADO
   personnel rotate between positions, so the occasional disappearance of
   characters some of whom would later return in other positions fits in
   with the concept of the series. Also, due to the scheduling of the
   series which did not reflect the production order, some episodes
   featuring departed cast members were not actually aired until late in
   the series, giving the impression that no major cast changes occurred.
   Among the major actors, only Ed Bishop appeared in all episodes. These
   are the major recurring characters in the series:

[[138]edit] Comm. Ed Straker ([139]Ed Bishop)

   A former [140]American Air Force pilot and astronaut originally from
   [141]Boston who organized SHADO following a series of UFO attacks in
   1970. Straker masquerades as the head of Harlington-Straker Film
   Studios, SHADO Headquarters being located directly below the studio.

   He was married to Mary Nightingale in 1970, but they soon divorced
   after the birth of John, their son. Timeframes are never given for
   events before the series, but it would be reasonable to presume that
   their marriage had ended by the end of the flashback presented in
   "Confetti Check A-OK". As if perhaps to show her opinion of Straker and
   his cold attitude, Mary registered their son as John Rutland, after his
   new stepfather, played by [142]Philip Madoc. John was later seriously
   injured when he was hit by a car and Straker, against his own rules,
   used a SHADO aircraft in order to fly in antibiotic drugs from America.
   When his second-in-command, Col. Freeman, diverted the plane in order
   to investigate some curious UFO-related events in Ireland, Straker's
   sense of duty prevented him from informing and overruling him as to the
   plane's original mission. The drugs arrived too late at the hospital
   and John died ("A Question of Priorities"). In other sci-fi series, a
   character must face a challenge and overcome it, though the problem is
   invariably solved by hour's end after which all is well. In contrast,
   the UFO series makes it clear that Ed Straker has had to completely
   sacrifice his personal life for the organisation, and that although he
   has learned to live with the fact, he has never forgotten the suffering
   it has caused to him and people he loved most. Moreover, it is
   repeatedly demonstrated that there is no realistic prospect of
   Straker's circumstances ever improving, though if circumstances were
   different he would undoubtedly embrace change. Straker's underlying
   tension and unhappiness is the foundation of his wounded character,
   exemplified most powerfully in the "Confetti Check A-OK" episode. The
   overall effect of Straker's regularly-referenced [143]back story is to
   transform what could have been a stereotypical sci-fi character into
   one who is three-dimensional, complex and sympathetic.

   One consistent element of Straker's character is that he refuses to
   drink alcohol even though he has a fully stocked bar in his SHADO
   office. An early episode refers to him possessing the willpower to
   avoid alcohol, which suggests that he was once an [144]alcoholic.
   However, Straker is fond of cigars and can be seen smoking in some
   episodes. Straker suffers from [145]claustrophobia, a fact known only
   to the SHADO doctors and Alec Freeman. This was a major sub-plot in the
   episode "Sub-Smash."

[[146]edit] Col. Paul Foster ([147]Michael Billington)

   Former test pilot whose plane was critically damaged when SHADO's Sky
   One intercepted and destroyed a UFO in close proximity to Foster's jet.
   His subsequent persistent investigation of the incident threatened to
   expose SHADO's existence and Straker considered having him killed, but
   instead was impressed enough with Foster to offer him a position with
   SHADO. Foster appears to be somewhat of a [148]protg of Straker's, as
   he is shown in a number of major positions. He is Moonbase Commander
   for a time (substituting for Lt. Ellis), is assigned to Skydiver for
   several months, and also receives a position of authority at SHADO HQ.
   He masquerades as one of Straker's film producers in the studio and
   enjoyed a brief relationship with Col. Virginia Lake. Foster has the
   unique distinction of having once befriended one of the aliens, though
   he could not prevent him from being killed by SHADO personnel; his
   overall demeanor became noticeably more cynical after this event
   (chronicled in the episode "Survival").

[[149]edit] Lt. Gay Ellis ([150]Gabrielle Drake)

   Most often seen as Moonbase Commander during the first half of the
   series, Lt. Ellis is occasionally portrayed as lacking self-confidence,
   and at other times as a take-charge officer. She is briefly reassigned
   to SHADO HQ when it is suggested that she may be romantically involved
   with Interceptor pilot Mark Bradley ("Computer Affair"). She also
   appears to be attracted to Ed Straker, though nothing comes of this.

[[151]edit] Col. Alec Freeman ([152]George Sewell)

   SHADO's first officer until about the three-quarter point in the series
   (when Sewell left following the change of studios). A lady's man in his
   early 40s, Freeman is Straker's right hand man and, occasionally, his
   muscle. Everybody's pal at SHADO, Freeman takes a sardonic attitude
   towards some of the things Straker and SHADO must do to survive, and
   once submitted his resignation in protest over a decision ("Computer
   Affair"). Straker's closest friend and best man at his wedding, Freeman
   was the very first operative recruited into SHADO by Straker (as seen
   in "Confetti Check A-OK").

[[153]edit] Gen. James Henderson ([154]Grant Taylor)

   Straker's superior officer, Henderson heads the International
   Astrophysical Commission, which is a front for SHADO and is responsible
   for obtaining funds and equipment from government in order to keep
   SHADO operational. Straker and Henderson butt heads frequently over the
   needs of SHADO and economic realities.

[[155]edit] Col. Virginia Lake ([156]Wanda Ventham)

   Virginia Lake first appears in the opening episode of the series
   ("Identified"), as a SHADO scientist and prospective romantic conquest
   for Alec Freeman. During the last quarter of the series, Lake returns
   to, ironically, take over the post of SHADO first officer, replacing
   Freeman. A computer specialist, she also served as Moonbase Commander.
   She was romantically involved with Paul Foster for a time. She
   initially has a somewhat tense working relationship with Straker,
   though by the end of the series they appear to have grown close and she
   is seen comforting him in the final scene of the final episode ("The
   Long Sleep").

[[157]edit] Capt. Peter Carlin ([158]Peter Gordeno)

   During the first third of the series, Carlin is the commander of the
   submarine SkyDiver and pilot of its interceptor aircraft, Sky One. In
   1970, Carlin and his sister found a UFO and were attacked; he was shot
   and wounded and his sister vanished. He joined SHADO in hopes of
   finding out what happened to his sister, and eventually learned that
   her organs had been harvested ("Identified").

[[159]edit] Lt. Nina Barry ([160]Dolores Mantez)

   One of Straker's first recruits into SHADO, Barry works as a Space
   Tracker at Moonbase and later replaces Lt. Ellis as its commanding
   officer. She also serves aboard Skydiver at one point ("Sub-Smash").
   One of several women attracted to Straker, she is the second most
   frequently appearing character in the series, appearing in 23 of 26
   episodes.

[[161]edit] Capt. Lew Waterman ([162]Gary Myers)

   Initially an Interceptor pilot on the Moon, Waterman is later promoted
   to captain and replaces Peter Carlin as commanding officer of Skydiver
   and pilot of Sky One. He becomes a very close friend of Paul Foster's
   (as suggested in "Ordeal").

[[163]edit] Lt. Keith Ford ([164]Keith Alexander)

   Former television interviewer who became a founding member of SHADO and
   its main communications officer. Actor Keith Alexander left the series
   after the production break, so the character disappears at the 2/3 mark
   of the series.

[[165]edit] Lt. Ayshea Johnson ([166]Ayshea Brough)

   A SHADO headquarters officer in most episodes. Initially seen doing
   miscellaneous tasks stationed at a computer console, she's the woman
   seen turning in her seat to smile and wave at an (offscreen) Col. Alec
   Freeman in the opening credits she later becomes SHADO's communications
   officer following the departure of Lt. Ford. In her final appearance,
   she is stationed at Moonbase ("Mindbender"). Highly observant, she
   provides crucial information in the episode "The Cat with Ten Lives."
   NB: this character's full name is given in episode scripts but only
   referred to once on screen (in "The Sound of Silence"). In the credits
   she is identified only as Ayshea (as is the actress).

[[167]edit] Dr. Doug Jackson ([168]Vladek Sheybal)

   SHADO psychiatrist and science officer. A somewhat sinister-looking
   figure who sometimes appears to have his own agenda, Jackson serves a
   number of capacities within SHADO, including acting as prosecution
   officer during the court martial of Paul Foster. When Foster escapes
   custody after being found (falsely) guilty, Jackson successfully
   convinces General Henderson to have his guards use tranquilizer darts
   in their pursuit, rather than shooting to kill. It is implied that Doug
   Jackson is not the character's birth name, as he speaks with a strong
   Eastern European accent. His origins, however, are never explored.

[[169]edit] Lt. Joan Harrington ([170]Antonia Ellis)

   Another Moonbase Space Tracker, Harrington was one of the organisation
   earliest recruits (as seen in "Confetti Check A-OK").

[[171]edit] Miss Ealand ([172]Norma Ronald)

   SHADO operative masquerading as Straker's movie studio secretary. She
   is the first line of defence against anyone entering SHADO HQ via
   Straker's office/elevator. The character is not seen in most of the
   post-studio change episodes, being replaced in two episodes by a Miss
   Holland (played by [173]Lois Maxwell).

[[174]edit] Lt. Mark Bradley ([175]Harry Baird)

   Caribbean-born Interceptor pilot based on the Moon. He becomes
   romantically involved with Lt. Ellis for a time, leading to a temporary
   assignment at SHADO HQ on Earth, and later briefly assumes the position
   of Moonbase Commander. Baird left the series after filming four
   episodes, but appeared in stock footage in several later episodes.

[[176]edit] Minor characters

   One of the unnamed female Moonbase operatives was played by
   [177]Shakira Baksh, who later married actor [178]Michael Caine.
   Producer [179]Gerry Anderson later said that he had lost his temper
   with her so badly on the set of UFO, that he always feared the idea of
   running into Michael Caine at some actors' function, and being punched
   in the nose by him.^[180][1]

[[181]edit] Look of the show

     * Not only is it never explained why female Moonbase personnel
       uniformally wore purple wigs and extensive eye make-up (although it
       has been suggested it was to combat static electricity), their
       unusual livery is never alluded to in the series. Gerry Anderson
       has commented that it made them look more futuristic and that it
       filmed better under the bright lights, while Sylvia Anderson said
       she believed wigs would become accepted components of military
       uniforms by the 1980s. Whenever female Moonbase personnel visited
       Earth (as Ellis and Barry did from time to time), their lunar
       regalia was never worn.
     * Ed Bishop, who had dark hair in real life, initially bleached his
       hair for Straker's unique white-haired look. He later began wearing
       a white wig when the bleaching began damaging his hair. Straker's
       unusual look may have been an attempt to make Bishop look like
       Captain Blue, the character he voiced in [182]Captain Scarlet and
       the Mysterons. Bishop, until not long before his death, possessed
       one of the wigs he wore on the show and took great delight in
       displaying it at [183]science fiction conventions and on TV
       programmes. He also kept a [184]Certina watch that was specially
       made for his character. The look of Straker was one of the
       inspirations behind [185]The Fast Show character 'Jazz Club's'
       Louis Balfour.^[186][2]
     * Many other male characters in the series also wore wigs, again
       because the Andersons felt that they would become fashionable for
       both sexes by the 1980s. Early episodes in which Michael Billington
       does not wear a wig can be identified by his receding hairline and
       long sideburns.
     * On both Skydiver and Moonbase, SHADO pilots enter their interceptor
       craft by sliding down tubes. This is an allusion to the Andersons'
       earlier series, [187]Thunderbirds, which had the characters
       accessing their craft in similar fashion.
     * Ed Straker's dramatic gas turbine car, resembling somewhat the 1970
       [188]Citron SM, was, in fact, a humble [189]Ford Zephyr with a
       specially built aluminium bodyshell.
     * The SHADO HQ and Moonbase control consoles, computer units,
       lighting panels and spacesuits make numerous appearances in other
       TV shows of the 1970s such as [190]Dr Who, [191]Timeslip,
       [192]Doomwatch, [193]The Tomorrow People, [194]The Goodies,
       [195]The New Avengers, [196]Star Maidens and [197]Blake's 7, as
       well as feature films such as [198]Diamonds Are Forever, [199]Carry
       On Loving and Confessions of a Pop Performer. An Alien spacesuit
       can also be seen in the Children's Film Foundation film Kadoing.
     * [200]Sylvia Anderson, having had made a pair of very sheer trousers
       for actor [201]Patrick Allen to wear in the episode "Timelash,"
       later regretted not having had the nerve to ask him to wear a jock
       strap underneath, and commented on the DVD release of the series
       that "you should not be able to tell which side anybody's 'packet'
       is on."
     * The futuristic, gull-winged cars driven by the Ed Straker and Paul
       Foster characters were originally built for the Anderson movie
       [202]Doppelgnger (US title: [203]Journey to the Far Side of the
       Sun). During the shooting of the UFO series, David Lowe and Sydney
       Carlton raised funds to form a company called "The Explorer Motor
       Company," dedicated to the mass production of these cars for sale
       to the public. A plastic mold was made of the Straker car, in
       preparation for mass production, but the company never got off the
       ground. [204][2]
     * Both [205]Ed Bishop and [206]Michael Billington have commented that
       the futuristic cars were 'impossible to drive.' (Partly because the
       steering wheel was designed for looks, rather than functionality.)
       Also, the gull-wing doors did not open automatically. Every shot in
       which the car door was seen to open automatically had to be
       arranged so that a prop man could run up to the car, just outside
       of the frame, open the door, and hold it open while Ed Bishop
       stepped out. In certain episodes (most notably "Court Martial") the
       prop man can be seen
     * The episode "Survival" shows that the Moon base is in the Mare
       Imbrium, or in the northeast part of it, according to a map that
       Foster and an alien studied while they were stranded on the
       surface. The map is a [207]real one.
     * On the Carlton DVD commentary for the first episode, Gerry Anderson
       noted that perhaps the programme's most dated aspect was its
       tobacco and alcohol consumption. Straker has a futuristic home bar
       in his office which dispenses [208]whisky, [209]bourbon,
       [210]vodka, etc., from which Col. Freeman partakes fairly
       regularly. While he himself does not drink, Straker is regularly
       seen smoking in SHADO headquarters (despite its computer
       equipment), his tobacco of choice being either a cigarette or what
       appears to be a slim [211]panatela cigar complete with [212]holder.
       And despite the high-tech milieu and enclosed environments, smoking
       is seen throughout the show, as was par for course in 1970s British
       television drama. As a consequence some of the sequences in the
       bunker of SHADO HQ are seen through a slight smoky [213]fug.
       Similarly many of the medical staff smoke whilst on duty, and
       smoking is even permitted on board the closed environment of the
       Skydiver, where Capt. Carlin is shown idly flicking through
       magazines with a cigarette in hand. Most striking of all, Moonbase
       personnel also light up frequently.
     * Much of the Moonbase set, instrument panels etc. were recycled
       under the wing of another Anderson company 21st Century Props and
       appear in many other TV and Film sci-fi productions.

[[214]edit] Predictions

   UFO, which was filmed in 1969 and 1970, made a number of predictions
   about what life in the 1980s would be like, some of which have come
   true. Among the innovations predicted by the series:
     * [215]Car telephones (a.k.a. [216]cell phones)
     * [217]Gull-wing doors on automobiles (actually these had been
       pioneered over a decade earlier in real life, in the
       [218]Mercedes-Benz 300SL, but were not widespread in 1969.)
     * Spacecraft launched from an aircraft.
     * Extensive use of [219]computers in day-to-day life, even to the
       extent of predicting and analyzing human behaviour
     * Electronic [220]fingerprint scanning and identification against a
       [221]database.
     * Voice print identification systems; also, vocal analysis used to
       identify individuals in the same way as fingerprints.
     * [222]Spy satellites.
     * The episode "Survival" indicates that, in the UFO universe, racial
       prejudice was wiped out on Earth in the mid-1970s, a prediction
       which did not come true.
     * That cars would drive on the right-hand side of the road in the UK
       and be converted to left-hand drive (another prediction which
       didn't come true).
     * UFO also featured episodes dealing with issues that would become
       topical in later years, such as [223]space junk and the disposal of
       [224]toxic waste.
     * [225]Cordless telephone (the three on Straker's office desk had no
       cord between the handsets and the base)

[[226]edit] Episodes

   Due to the then highly localised nature of the [227]ITV "network" in
   the United Kingdom, the 26 episodes of UFO were shown out of production
   order, and every broadcaster showed the episodes in different order. As
   the list below (loosely based on information from the book The Complete
   Gerry Anderson) shows, on several occasions during the first run
   various broadcasters aired different episodes of the series on the same
   day. Some UK broadcasters did not air some episodes until 1973; as a
   result, some episode guides may list these episodes in different order.
   The North American DVD release of the series usually follows the
   production order, with a few diversions. The website [228]ufoseries.com
   offers seven viewing order possibilities. According to The Complete
   Gerry Anderson, the episode "Exposed" was intended to be aired second,
   but it was produced fifth and appears as the fifth episode in the
   American DVD release.

   [295]David Weston, [296]Ray Armstrong Foster is stranded on the Moon,
   where he befriends a similarly stranded alien. In this episode, Straker
   says that racial prejudice burned itself out "five years ago", this
   said on 13 April 1981. In the other Anderson series "Space: 1999",
   Cmdr. Koenig hints that prejudice was finally ended in a great conflict
   about 10-12 years prior to 1999.

   Marcus, [306]Stanley McGeagh An alien device causes Straker and other
   SHADO operatives to hallucinate. Ed Straker hallucinates that he is an
   actor in a television series about UFOs and aliens. He then steps out
   of the set and onto the real-world sound stage where UFO is filmed, and
   we can see all the sets that were used to film the series. Also, in
   Straker's hallucination, all the actors (except Ed Bishop) are called
   by their real names: Paul Foster is called "Mike" (as in Mike
   Billington), General Henderson is called "Grant" (as in Grant Taylor),
   and so on.

   [323]Dr. Frank E. Stranges, [324]David Weston, [325]Alan Tucker
   Communications problems at Moonbase are traced to a non-SHADO mining
   operation. Episode features additional moonbases not affiliated with
   SHADO and communication between them.

   [328]John J. Carney Time stands still at the film studio for everyone
   but Straker, Col. Lake and a mysterious enemy. In-programme physics are
   strange - a chair in mid air can't be moved, but a piece of wood can be
   moved, which raises the question of how the characters can breathe?
   Note that Col. Lake doesn't have the Moonbase purple hair-do on Earth.
   Some serious use of 'speed' drugs (see also "The Long Sleep" episode
   below). Some extremely silly props in the cross-studio chase scenes.
   Best line of the episode: "I think I'll just play that back."
   1-22 3 March 1971 The Responsibility Seat 10 [329]Jane Merrow Straker

   Roberts, [332]John Garrie, [333]Christopher Robbie A woman awakening
   from a decade-long coma sparks a hunt for an alien bomb. It is often
   reported that the references to drug use in this episode led to several
   regional networks dropping it from the original UK run, but this is a
   fallacy.

   Rimmer, [341]Jeffrey Segal, [342]Tom Oliver, [343]Donald Pelmear,
   [344]Geoffrey Hinsliff, [345]Jack May, [346]Alan Tilvern, [347]Gordon
   Sterne A flashback episode focusing on SHADO's formation and Straker's
   failed marriage. Episode continues the creation of SHADO CONTROL (in
   the episode's past).
   1-26 24 July 1971 Reflections in the Water 23 [348]Steven Berkoff,
   [349]James Cosmo, [350]Richard Caldicot, [351]David Warbeck,
   [352]Anouska Hempel, [353]Gordon Sterne, [354]Conrad Phillips,
   [355]Gerald Cross Straker and Foster investigate an undersea alien
   base. The massive UFO attack battle scene at the end was almost
   entirely a compilation of special effects shots from previous episodes.
   Four interceptor missiles are seen to be launched, implying that a
   spare craft was launched for the emergency. The terrestrial portion of
   the battle seemed to suggest that Sky 1 took out 25 UFOs unassisted.

   A number episodes were edited together in the late 1970s to form the
   feature-length Invasion: UFO, which was syndicated to American and
   European broadcasters. It primarily consists of approximately 30
   minutes each from Identified, Computer Affair, and Reflections in the
   Water, with the ending taken from The Man Who Came Back. Shorter
   segments from ESP and Confetti Check A-OK are used to bridge continuity
   gaps.

[[356]edit] UFO stories in other media

   Stories set in the Gerry Anderson UFO series have appeared in various
   media:-
     * Two novelizations based upon the series were published in the UK
       and America.[357][3]
     * In the [358]comics "[359]Countdown" and "[360]TV Action".
     * In 1991 to 1999 [361]Entropy Express in [362]Brighton, South
       Australia published 7 issues of a periodical called Flightpath,
       containing 39 text stories set in the UFO scenario. These include a
       [363]crossover with [364]Bergerac (TV series), and a crossover with
       [365]Predator (film).
     * There was a hardback annual for the series featuring text stories.
       There were also hardback annuals for the Countdown and TV Action
       comics featuring comic strips.
     * Much [366]fan-fiction has been written in this series's scenario.
     * An Italian-language [367]board game of the [368]race game type was
       published, called Distruggete Base Luna (= "Destroy Moonbase"),
       with up to 4 players, each representing an alien trying to
       penetrate Moonbase, and one player representing Straker in charge
       of Moonbase.

[[369]edit] Revivals

   Several attempts have been made to either revive or remake the series.
   The first attempt, as mentioned above, evolved into [370]Space: 1999.
   In the 1990s and early 2000s there were scattered reports of production
   companies around the world investigating the possibility of producing a
   new TV series or film, most recently in 2003 when [371]Carlton
   International Media (current rights holders for the series) announced
   that an American company was planning to produce a new
   series,^[[372]citation needed] though as of 2007 nothing has yet come
   of this. Australian company Bump Map run by Albert Hastings pitched a
   revival of UFO to one of Australia's major TV production companies in
   1995/6. Also in 1996, Ed Bishop briefly corresponded with independent
   Australian film maker/UFO fan Adrian Sherlock about an unofficial
   revival called [373]Damon Dark : Shadofall. The project funding fell
   through but the script has been made into a fan-made audio production
   and uploaded to YouTube and continues as an independent series.
