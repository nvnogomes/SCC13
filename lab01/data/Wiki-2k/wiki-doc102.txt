[[17]edit] Biography

   Dorothy was born in [18]Whitefield, near [19]Bury in [20]Lancashire.
   Her father, Ernest Smith, died when Dodie was a baby and following his
   death, circa 1897, Dorothy and her mother Ella Furber Smith moved back
   in with her parents; William and Margaret Furber, at 586 Chester Road
   in the [21]Old Trafford district of [22]Stretford^[23][1]. The
   formative years of Dorothy's childhood were spent at this house. But in
   1910 Ella remarried and relocated with her new husband and the 14 year
   old Dodie to [24]London. In 1914, Dodie entered the Academy (later
   [25]Royal Academy) of Dramatic Art, and Ella died of [26]breast cancer.
   During Ella's illness, mother and daughter became followers of
   [27]Christian Science. (Smith, 1974).

   Dodie unsuccessfully pursued a career as an actress. In 1923, she took
   a job in [28]Heals furniture store in London and became the toy buyer
   (and a mistress of the chairman, [29]Ambrose Heal).^[30][2] She
   authored her first play, Autumn Crocus, in 1931 under the pseudonym
   C.L. Anthony. Its success, and the discovery of her identity by
   journalists, inspired the newspaper headline, "Shopgirl Writes Play".
   (Smith, 1979).

   She spent most of her years as a writer living in a [31]townhouse in
   [32]London, where a plaque now commemorates her occupation. In 1939,
   she married Alec Beesley, another employee at Heal's.

   During the 1940s, she and her husband moved to the United States due to
   legal difficulties with Beesley's stand as a [33]conscientious
   objector. (Smith, 1979). While living in the U.S. and feeling homesick
   for England, she wrote her first [34]novel, [35]I Capture the Castle
   (1948). During the American interlude, the Beesleys became friends with
   writers [36]Christopher Isherwood, [37]Charles Brackett, and [38]John
   Van Druten. In Smith's memoirs, she credits Alec with making the
   suggestion to Van Druten that he adapt Isherwood's Sally Bowles story
   [39]Goodbye to Berlin into a play (the Van Druten play, [40]I Am A
   Camera, later became the musical [41]Cabaret). In her memoirs, Smith
   acknowledges having received writing advice from her friend, the
   novelist [42]A. J. Cronin.

   Smith is best known for her novel [43]The Hundred and One Dalmatians
   (1956) (which was adapted into the [44]Disney [45]animated film [46]One
   Hundred and One Dalmatians). Her novel [47]I Capture the Castle also
   has a devoted following ([48]a film version was released in 2003).

   Smith died in 1990 after naming [49]Julian Barnes as her literary
   executor, a job she felt would not be much work. Barnes writes of the
   complicated task in his essay "Literary Executions", revealing among
   other things how he secured the return of the film rights to I Capture
   the Castle, which had been held by Disney since 1949 (Barnes, 2003).
   Smith's personal papers are housed in [50]Boston University's Howard
   Gotlieb Archival Research Center, and include manuscripts, photographs,
   artwork, and correspondence (including letters from [51]Christopher
   Isherwood and [52]John Gielgud).

[[63]edit] The Hundred and One Dalmatians

   Pongo, the canine protagonist of The Hundred and One Dalmatians, was
   named after Smith's own pet [64]Dalmatian, the first of nine. Smith got
   the idea for her novel when a friend remarked at her own dalmatians:
   Those dogs would make a lovely fur coat!
