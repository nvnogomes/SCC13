Sanitization (classified information)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Document sanitizing)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   Not to be confused with [9]Data cleansing.

   Sanitization (also '[10]redaction') is the process of removing
   sensitive information from a document or other medium, so that it may
   be distributed to a broader audience. When dealing with [11]classified
   information, sanitization attempts to reduce the document's
   classification level, possibly yielding an unclassified document.
   Originally, the term sanitization was applied to [12]printed documents;
   it has since been extended to apply to [13]computer media and the
   problem of [14]data remanence as well.

   Redaction generally refers to the [15]editing or blacking out of text
   in a document, or to the result of such an effort. It is intended to
   allow the selective disclosure of information in a document while
   keeping other parts of the document secret. Typically the result is a
   document that is suitable for [16]publication, or for dissemination to
   others than the intended audience of the original document. For
   example, when a document is [17]subpoenaed in a court case, information
   not specifically relevant to the case at hand is often redacted.

[[25]edit] Government secrecy

   In the context of [26]government documents, redaction (also called
   sanitization) generally refers more specifically to the process of
   removing sensitive or [27]classified information from a document prior
   to its publication, during [28]declassification.

[[29]edit] Secure document redaction techniques

   [31]American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft

   The traditional technique of redacting confidential material from a
   paper document before its public release involves crossing out portions
   of text with a wide black pen, followed by photocopying the result.
   This is a relatively easy to understand process and has only minor
   risks associated with it. For example, if the black pen is not wide
   enough, careful examination of the resulting photocopy may still reveal
   partial information about the text, such as the difference between
   short and tall letters. The exact length of the removed text also
   remains recognizable, which may help to guess plausible wordings for
   shorter redacted sections. Where computer-generated proportional fonts
   were used, even more information can leak out of the redacted section
   in the form of the exact position of nearby visible characters.

   The [32]National Archives (UK) published a document, [33]Redaction
   Toolkit, Guidelines for the Editing of Exempt Information from
   Documents Prior to Release (2004), "to provide guidance on the editing
   of exempt material from information held by public bodies."

   Secure redacting is a far more complicated problem with word processing
   file formats. These may also save a revision history of the edited text
   that still contains the redacted text. In some file formats, unused
   portions of memory are saved that may still contain fragments of
   previous versions of the text. Where text is redacted by overlaying
   graphical elements (usually black rectangles) on top of text, the
   original text remains in the file and can be uncovered by simply
   deleting the overlaying graphics. Effective redaction of electronic
   documents requires the actual removal of the text or image data from
   the document file. This either requires a very detailed understanding
   of the internal operation of the document processing software and file
   formats used, which most computer users lack, or software tools
   designed for sanitizing electronic documents (see external links
   below).

   Redaction usually requires a marking of the redacted area with the
   reason why the content is being restricted. Government documents being
   released under the Freedom Act are marked with exemption codes that
   denote the reason why the content has been sanitized.

   The [34]National Security Agency published a document, [35]Redacting
   with Confidence: How to Safely Publish Sanitized Reports Converted from
   Word to PDF, which provides instructions for redacting [36]Microsoft
   Word generated [37]PDF files.

[[38]edit] Printed matter

   A page of a [39]classified document that has been sanitized for public
   release. This is page 13 of a [40]U.S. National Security Agency report
   [41][1] on the [42]USS Liberty incident, which was declassifed and
   released to the public in July 2003. Classified information has been
   blocked out so that only the unclassified information is visible.
   Notations with leader lines at top and bottom cite statutory authority
   for not declassifying certain sections. Click on the image to enlarge.

   A printed document which contains classified or sensitive information
   will frequently contain a great deal of information which is less
   sensitive. There may be a need to release the less sensitive portions
   to [43]uncleared personnel. The printed document will thus be sanitized
   to obscure or remove the sensitive information. The term [44]redaction
   is also used to describe this process, though that term is more often
   used in literary contexts.

   In some cases, sanitizing a classified document removes enough
   information to reduce the classification from a higher level to a lower
   one. For example, raw [45]intelligence reports may contain highly
   classified information, like the identities of [46]spies, that is
   removed before the reports are distributed outside the intelligence
   agency: the initial report may be classified as Top Secret while the
   sanitized report may be classified as Secret.

   In other cases, like the [47]U.S. National Security Agency's report on
   the [48]USS Liberty incident (right), the report may be sanitized to
   remove all sensitive data, so that the report may be released to the
   general public.

   As is seen in the USS Liberty report, paper documents are generally
   sanitized by covering the classified and sensitive portions and then
   photocopying the document, resulting in a sanitized document suitable
   for distribution.

[[49]edit] Computer media and files

          See also: [50]Data remanence and [51]Data erasure

   Computer (electronic or digital) documents are more difficult to
   sanitize. In many cases, when information in an information system is
   modified or erased, some or all of the data remains in [52]storage.
   This may be an accident of design, where the underlying storage
   mechanism ([53]disk, [54]RAM, etc.) still allows information to be
   read, despite its nominal erasure. The general term for this problem is
   [55]data remanence. In some contexts (notably the US [56]NSA, [57]DoD,
   and related organizations), sanitization typically refers to countering
   the data remanence problem; redaction is used in the sense of this
   article.

   However, the retention may be a deliberate [58]feature, in the form of
   an [59]undo buffer, revision history, "trash can", [60]backups, or the
   like. For example, word processing programs like [61]Microsoft Word
   will sometimes be used to edit out the sensitive information.
   Unfortunately, these products do not always show the user all of the
   information stored in a file, so it is possible that a file may still
   contain sensitive information. In other cases, inexperienced users will
   use ineffective methods which fail to sanitize the document.

   In May, 2005, the US military published a report on the death of
   [62]Nicola Calipari, an Italian secret agent, at a US military
   checkpoint in Iraq. The report was published in [63]Adobe PDF format
   and had apparently been sanitized using commercial word processing
   tools. Shortly thereafter, readers discovered that the blocked-out
   portions could be retrieved using simple [64]cut and paste operations
   on the posted document.^[65][1]

   Similarly, on May 24, 2006, lawyers for the communications service
   provider [66]AT&T filed a legal brief^[67][2] regarding their
   cooperation with domestic wiretapping by the [68]NSA. Text on pages 12
   through 14 of the [69]Adobe PDF document were blacked out in an attempt
   to sanitize the document, but the hidden text could be retrieved using
   cut and paste.^[70][3]

   At the end of 2005, the [71]NSA released a report giving
   recommendations on how to safely sanitize a [72]Word document.^[73][4]

   Issues such as these make it difficult to reliably implement
   [74]multilevel security systems, in which computer users of differing
   security clearances may share documents. The Challenge of Multilevel
   Security gives an example of a sanitization failure caused by
   unexpected behavior in Microsoft Word's change tracking
   feature.^[75][5]
