   Edward Biberman (23 October 1904 - 27 January 1986) was an [18]American
   [19]artist active in the mid-twentieth century. His work ranged from
   stylised [20]portraits to history-inspired [21]murals, and drew on the
   emerging urban landscapes of [22]southern California, and on current
   events such as the [23]Great Depression, the [24]Second World War, and
   labour unrest.

[[29]edit] Life and career

   Biberman was born into a prosperous [30]Philadelphia family of
   [31]Russian [32]Jewish immigrants, and studied economics at the
   [33]Wharton School.^[34][1] His later studies at the [35]Pennsylvania
   Academy of Fine Arts, followed by three years in [36]Paris, led to his
   decision to become a full time artist. He lived in [37]New York City
   from 1929 to 1936, where he came into contact with the [38]Mexican
   muralists [39]Diego Rivera, [40]David Alfaro Siqueiros and [41]Jose
   Clemente Orozco; thanks to their influence, Biberman became a champion
   of public murals. In 1930, he was named one of the 46 Under 35 younger
   artists featured in a [42]Museum of Modern Art exhibition.

   In 1931, he lived for the summer in a [43]Navajo settlement at
   [44]Monument Valley, where his work focused on both the Navajo people
   and on their desert surroundings. His experiences there inspired in him
   a love of the [45]southwestern United States, and he was soon to move
   there permanently. Following his arrival in [46]Los Angeles in 1936,
   the city which would inspire some of his best-known work, he won two
   commissions for murals to decorate the Los Angeles Federal Building.
   When the building was remodelled in 1965, the murals were removed and
   placed in storage. Though initially popular for the clean lines and
   crisp colours of his work, his career never recovered from the blow it
   received when he, his wife, and other members of his circle were
   accused of being [47]Communists.^[48][2] Despite these accusations, he
   lived in [49]Los Angeles for the rest of his life.

   Biberman wrote two books about his paintings, The Best Untold and Time
   and Circumstance. From 1938 to 1950, he taught at the [50]Art Center
   College of Design in [51]Pasadena, and lectured widely on art subjects
   for the University Extension of [52]UCLA. In the 1960s, Biberman hosted
   television programs on art, including Dialogues in Art from 1967-1968.

   Biberman was married for 51 years to [53]Sonja Dahl Biberman
   (1910-2007), an artist in her own right. His brother, [54]Herbert
   Biberman, was the [55]screenwriter and [56]director known for having
   been one of the [57]Hollywood Ten. His great-nephew is Jeremy Strick,
   the director of the [58]Museum of Contemporary Art, Los
   Angeles.^[59][3] Edward Biberman died of cancer in 1986.

[[60]edit] Exhibitions and awards

   Over the course of his career, Biberman exhibited his works at more
   than 35 solo exhibitions in [61]Philadelphia, [62]New York, [63]Boston,
   [64]Chicago, [65]Paris, [66]Berlin, and [67]California. His works were
   also displayed at the [68]American Artists Congress (1936), the [69]San
   Francisco Art Association (1937), the [70]Golden Gate International
   Exposition (1939), the [71]California Art Club (1943), and the
   [72]Whitney Museum (1953).

   His paintings are now to be found in the permanent collections of the
   Museum of the [73]Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts,
   [74]Philadelphia, and the [75]Museum of Fine Arts, [76]Houston,
   [77]Texas. His life-size portraits of singer [78]Lena Horne and author
   [79]Dashiell Hammett form part of the [80]Smithsonian's National
   Portrait Gallery. Among his awards are the Lambert Fund Purchase
   Prize.^[81][4]
