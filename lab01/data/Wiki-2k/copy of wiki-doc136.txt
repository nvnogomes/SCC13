   [13]Domestic violence in [14]Argentina is a serious problem. In Buenos
   Aires Province, the special Women's Police Stations and Family's police
   stations received a daily average of 53 complaints of violence.^[15][1]

   Argentine law prohibits domestic violence, including spousal abuse, and
   provides for removal of the abusive spouse from the home, but it does
   not provide penalties unless the violence involves crimes against
   "sexual integrity." In this case penalties can be as much as 20 years'
   imprisonment.^[16][1]

   Any person suffering physical or psychological domestic violence may
   file a formal complaint with a judge or police station. The law gives
   family court judges the right to prevent the perpetrator of a violent
   act from entering the victim's home or workplace. Charges also may be
   brought in criminal court, which may apply corresponding penalties.
   However, lack of vigilance on the part of the police and the judicial
   system often led to a lack of protection for victims.^[17][1]

   In March 2006 the Interior Ministry launched a federal program that
   included creating a mobile unit for providing assistance to victims of
   sexual and domestic violence. Although the program was planned to have
   a national reach, its initial implementation started in late October
   2006 in the City of Buenos Aires. There were two mobile units working
   24 hours a day. Each unit was composed of a psychologist and a social
   worker, and two police officials also took part when they received
   complaints of domestic violence.^[18][1]

   In March 2006 the provincial Cordoba legislature passed its first
   domestic violence law, leading to a significant increase in the number
   of complaints filed. The legislation is quite inclusive. The term
   "family" includes fiancees and former or current common-law husbands or
   wives. The law also defines domestic violence as physical,
   psychological, and economic violence.^[19][1]

   In early December 2006 the Buenos Aires Supreme Court ordered the
   criminal, family and minors' courts, as well as provincial courts in
   civil and family matters, to have duty officers to receive complaints
   of domestic violence and assist victims after normal court hours.
   Victims could call a cell phone number to get assistance.^[20][1]

   Public and private institutions offered prevention programs and
   provided support and treatment for abused women, but there was little
   transitional housing. The Buenos Aires municipal government operated a
   small shelter for battered women and a 24 hour hotline offering support
   and guidance to victims of violence; however, few other shelters
   existed.^[21][1]

   NGOs stressed that women often did not have a full understanding of
   their rights or of what actions could be considered punishable
   offenses. In addition there was a great disparity between urban centers
   and rural areas with respect to women's awareness of, and access to,
   equal rights. Indigenous women particularly were vulnerable, due to
   higher rates of illiteracy and insufficient bilingual educational
   resources.^[22][1]
