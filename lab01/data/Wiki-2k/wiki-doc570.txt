   Gansbaai ([12]Afrikaans: "bay of [13]geese," sometimes referred to as
   Gans Bay) is a [14]fishing village and popular [15]tourist destination
   in the [16]Overberg District Municipality, [17]Western Cape, [18]South
   Africa. It is known for its dense population of [19]Great White Sharks
   and as a good [20]whale-watching location.

   Great White Shark - Gansbaai's biggest attraction The main tourist
   attraction to Gansbaai since around the year 1995 has been to cage dive
   with the Great white Sharks. It is said that after Kruger National
   Park, the Great White Shark attract some of the highest number of
   tourist to South Africa for any singular activity. During low season
   approximately 150 tourists view the sharks per day where as during peak
   season this number easily rises to 400. A shark dive currently costs
   R1200 per person. There are 8 operators in Gansbaai so if you are
   planning to do cage diving make sure you choose a credible and eco
   friendly company. A website with good reviews, facts and stats about
   each operator is [21]www.sharkbookings.com Make sure you visit this
   website before you decide who to undergo the excursion with.

[[22]edit] History

   Gansbaai at De Kelders has one of the oldest associations with man in
   the world. At the time when Neanderthal-man was still the dominant
   species of "homo" in Europe, a group of modern people (homo sapiens
   sapiens) had already made Klipgat Cave their home. Remains have been
   excavated showing modern man living here more than 70,000 years ago.
   Klipgat Cave is located in the Walker Bay Nature Reserve, next to De
   Kelders, the residential shore area of Gansbaai. As one of only three
   places in South Africa where such old remains have been excavated,
   Klipgat Cave is one of the most important historical sites in the
   Western Cape. The reserve and the cave are open to the public.

   The earliest evidence of the presence of sheep-herding "Khoi" people
   (after the hunter-gatherer-"San", the original indigenous population of
   the Western Cape) in the Western Cape has been found in Klipgat Cave as
   well. Until the arrival of the first white settlers at the end of the
   18th century, the Khoi people thrived in this region. An expedition
   sent by Jan van Riebeeck to the area, described meeting people of the
   so-called Chainouqua-tribe near Baardskeerdersbos, a rural hamlet, 15
   km from Gansbaai. The river flowing through the Baardskeerdersbos
   Valley is still called "Boesmansrivier" (Afrikaans for Bushman's
   river). "Bushman" is a name commonly used the for San-people, but will
   in this case have reflected Khoi-people.

   It was people of Khoi-descent that erected the first permanent
   settlement in the Gansbaai vicinity. In 1811 fishing-cottages were
   built at Stanfords Bay in De Kelders.

   The first white settlers in the area were "trekboere" (nomadic
   farmers). They copied the Khoi herding techniques of using a grazing
   area until it was exhausted, then moving on to greener pastures. The
   area was big and fertile enough for such purposes. On many of the large
   farms around Gansbaai, the old and original homesteads and
   mudstone-houses tell of the days that the white farmers settled down.
   Plaque commemorating the sinking of the [23]Birkenhead, affixed to the
   Danger Point lighthouse.

   Danger Point was the place where the [24]HMS Birkenhead was wrecked in
   1852. A barely visible rock 2 km from Danger Point (now aptly called
   "Birkenhead Rock") was fatal for the troopship carrying young Welsh and
   Scottish soldiers and their officers and family on their way to Eastern
   Cape to fight the Xhosa. The Birkenhead became famous because it was
   the first shipwreck where the "women-and-children-first" rule was
   applied. All women and children were saved, most of the men perished.
   The horses swam to shore and were the ancestors of a feral herd that
   roamed the plains east of Gansbaai until late in the 20th century.

   In 1895 the Danger Point Lighthouse was built, providing more security
   for the ships in these dangerous waters: between Danger Point and Cape
   Infanta, to the east of Gansbaai more than 140 ships have been wrecked
   and thousands of lives lost.

   Gansbaai was founded in 1881 after 18-year-old [25]fisherman Johannes
   Cornelis Wessels walked there across the [26]dunes from [27]Stanford
   and discovered excellent fishing in the area. He settled there, and
   soon after other families followed suit. Up until the late 20th
   century, however, it was little more than a primitive fishing village
   due to its isolation and lack of communication with the outside world.

   Gansbaai's [28]economy received a boost in 1939 when a small
   [29]factory was built to process [30]sharks' livers for [31]Vitamin A
   and [32]lubricant, which was in great demand during [33]World War II.
   After the war, however, demand fell and the few short years of
   prosperity were over.

   It wasn't until local school principal Johannes Barnard persuaded
   village fishermen to set up the first Fishery Cooperative in South
   Africa that the economy began to recover. Barnard helped the fishermen
   obtain capital from the Fisheries Development Corporation, deepen the
   harbour and establish a modern [34]fish meal factory. The town became a
   [35]municipality in 1963.

   Today, Gansbaai's economy still revolves around its fishing industry,
   but an increasingly large part of it now comes from tourism. It is
   considered the [36]Great White Shark capital of the world, drawing
   [37]National Geographic Society film crews and researchers from around
   the globe to study the wildlife. It has also become a popular
   [38]whale-watching spot for the [39]Southern Right Whale.

   The Southern right whale can be seen in large numbers, especially from
   the rocky shores of De Kelders on Walker Bay. This is also the site of
   the old whaling station. The look-out platform and the steps leading to
   it are still standing. Today whales are protected in South Afric and
   the descendants of the whalers are now the skippers on the boats that
   take tourists out for boat-based whale watching.

   The hinterland is known for its vast mountainous landscapes covered
   with unspoilt vegetation of the Cape Floral Kingdom ('fynbos"). Despite
   being the smallest of the world's six floral kingdoms, the Cape Floral
   Kingdom is -with 9000 species- the richest.

[[40]edit] Dyer Island, Geyser Rock and Shark Alley

   The original name of Dyer Island was Ilha da Fera (Island of wild
   creatures), so named by Portuguese seafarers in the 15th century.

   Dyer Island is the largest of a group of islands about five miles
   offshore from Gansbaai and less than that from Danger Point Peninsula.
   It is named after [41]Samson Dyer, an emigrant from the USA to the
   [42]Cape Colony in 1806, who lived on the island collecting [43]guano,
   which he sold to mainlanders as [44]fertilizer. The island is home to
   thousands of [45]African Penguins.

   Geyser Rock is a smaller island nearby, and is home to around 60,000
   thousand Cape Fur Seals.

   The shallow [46]channel between the two islands is popularly known as
   "Shark Alley".

   Dyer Island is a nature reserve and cannot be accessed by the general
   public but boat-tours leave from Kleinbaai on Danger Point Peninsula to
   watch whales, stop at a shark-diving-boat, to cross Shark-alley and to
   go around Dyer Island.
