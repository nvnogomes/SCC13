   Eduardo Gory Guerrero^[38][1] (October 9, 1967 November 13,
   2005)^[39][1] was a Mexican-American [40]professional wrestler born
   into a [41]Mexican wrestling family.^[42][2] He wrestled in [43]Mexico
   and [44]Japan and in several major [45]professional wrestling
   promotions in the [46]United States^[47][2] He wrestled in [48]Extreme
   Championship Wrestling (ECW), [49]World Championship Wrestling (WCW)
   and in [50]World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Guerrero's
   [51]personality was that of a crafty, resourceful wrestler who would do
   anything to win a match. His [52]catch phrase became "Cheat to Win."
   Despite being a [53]heel for most of his career, he got [54]over in and
   outside the ring. Another one of his famous slogans was "I Lie! I
   Cheat! I Steal!," which was used in one of his entrance themes. He
   partly used this phrase in his autobiography Cheating Death, Stealing
   Life.

   Throughout his career, Guerrero encountered various [55]substance abuse
   problems outside of wrestling, including [56]alcoholism and an
   addiction to [57]painkillers. His problems outside of the ring were
   sometimes integrated into his [58]angles. Notwithstanding these issues,
   he won numerous titles during his career, including the [59]WWE
   Championship. He was posthumously inducted into the [60]WWE Hall of
   Fame in 2006.^[61][3]

[[100]edit] Early life

   Guerrero came from a [101]wrestling family. His father, [102]Gory
   Guerrero^[103][2] was a wrestler in Mexico, a prominent wrestling
   trainer and an influential figure in Mexican professional wrestling.
   His mother is Herlinda Yaez, sister of professional wrestlers
   [104]Enrique, [105]Mario and [106]Sergio Yaez. His three brothers
   [107]Chavo Guerrero, [108]Hector Guerrero, and [109]Mando Guerrero all
   followed in their father's footsteps and became professional
   wrestlers.^[110][2] Guerrero's nephew, [111]Chavo Guerrero, Jr. also
   became a wrestler, while his uncle [112]Enrique Llanes (Yaez) and
   cousin Javier Llanes (Yaez) wrestled in Mexico. As a boy, Guerrero's
   father allowed him and Chavo Jr. to wrestle one another during
   intermissions in the wrestling promotions that Gory held. Gory held
   wrestling promotions for nearly 15 years in the El Paso Coliseum.

   Guerrero was born in and raised in [113]El Paso, Texas and attended the
   [114]University of New Mexico as well as [115]New Mexico Highlands
   University on an athletic scholarship, where he wrestled collegiately,
   before returning to El Paso to train as a professional
   wrestler.^[116][4]

[[117]edit] Personal Life

   Guerrero is survived by his widow [118]Vickie Guerrero. The two married
   on April 24, 1990^[119][5] and had two daughters Sherilyn and Shaul.
   Guerrero also has another daughter Kaylie born during his marital
   separation from Vickie.

[[120]edit] Professional wrestling career

[[121]edit] Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion (1992-1994)

[[122]edit] La Pareja Atomica

   In Mexico, he wrestled mainly for [123]Asistencia Asesora y
   Administracin, teaming with [124]El Hijo del Santo as the new version
   of La Pareja Atmica (The Atomic Pair), the legendary [125]tag team of
   [126]Gory Guerrero and [127]El Santo.

[[128]edit] La Pareja del Terror

   After Guerrero [129]turned on Santo and allied with [130]Art Barr as La
   Pareja del Terror (The Pair of Terror), the duo became arguably the
   most hated tag team in [131]lucha libre history.^[132][1] Along with
   Barr, [133]Konnan, Chicano Power and [134]Madonnas Boyfriend, Guerrero
   formed [135]Los Gringos Locos (The Crazy Americans), a heel
   [136]stable.^[137][1]^[138][6] Guerrero later said that no matter how
   many people joined Los Gringos Locos, the stable was all about Art. Los
   Gringos Locos feuded mostly with El Hijo del Santo and his partner
   [139]Octagn, eventually ending in a [140]Hair vs. Mask match at the
   first lucha [141]pay-per-view in America, [142]When Worlds Collide,
   which they lost.^[143][7]

   Guerrero and Barr's first break would come when they were noticed in
   late 1994 by the owner of [144]Extreme Championship Wrestling,
   [145]Paul Heyman, and were approached about wrestling for him in 1995.
   Barr, however, died before he could join ECW with Guerrero.

[[146]edit] New Japan Pro Wrestling (1993-1996)

   In 1993, Guerrero began wrestling in Japan for [147]New Japan Pro
   Wrestling, where he was known as [148]Black Tiger II. He won the NJPW
   Junior Heavyweight [149]Super Grade Tag League Championship with
   [150]The Great Sasuke in [151]1993, which made him the most successful
   Black Tiger.^[152][8] He became more successful upon his return when he
   won the [153]Best of the Super Juniors [154]1996 tournament of
   [155]junior heavyweights. He received a shot at the [156]IWGP Junior
   Heavyweight Champion The Great Sasuke at NJPW Skydiving J but lost the
   match.^[157][9]

[[158]edit] Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)

   Guerrero won the [159]ECW Television Championship from [160]2 Cold
   Scorpio on his debut,^[161][10]^[162][11]^[163][12] and went on to have
   a series of acclaimed matches with [164]Dean Malenko before they both
   signed with [165]World Championship Wrestling later that
   year.^[166][13] Guerrero lost the ECW Television Championship to
   Malenko on July 21 of that year,^[167][14] but Guerrero regained the
   title on July 28.^[168][11]^[169][15] Guerrero lost the ECW Television
   Championship back to 2 Cold Scorpio on August 25.^[170][16] The next
   day, they had their last match which ended in a draw in a [171]two out
   of three falls match at the [172]ECW arena. After the match, the locker
   room emptied and the two were carried around the ring by their fellow
   wrestlers while the crowd chanted "please don't go".^[173][17]

[[174]edit] World Championship Wrestling (1995-2000)

[[175]edit] Return to WCW (1995)

   Eddie Guerrero returned to WCW in late 1995 along with Dean Malenko and
   [176]Chris Benoit with whom he had worked with in NJPW and
   ECW.^[177][13]^[178][18] During his first few pay-per-view events, he
   competed in dark matches against [179]Alex Wright.^[180][19] His first
   televised pay-per-view appearance was at [181]World War 3 where he
   competed in the 3-ring, 60-man World War 3 battle royal for the vacant
   [182]WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Surprisingly, Guerrero was one
   of the final 10 men in the battle royal until he was tossed out of the
   ring by [183]Four Horsemen members.^[184][20] The battle royal was won
   by [185]Randy Savage.^[186][21] At [187]Starrcade 1995, Guerrero
   represented WCW in a WCW vs. NJPW World Cup tournament series. He fell
   to NJPW wrestler [188]Shinjiro Otani in the match but WCW went on to
   win the series.^[189][22]

[[190]edit] United States Champion (1996-1997)

   While in 1996, Guerrero received several shots at the [191]WCW United
   States Heavyweight Championship against [192]Konnan at
   [193]Uncensored^[194][23] and [195]Ric Flair at [196]Hog
   Wild.^[197][24] He started a feud with Ric Flair and the [198]Four
   Horsemen during 1996 after Guerrero's partner [199]Arn Anderson turned
   on him during a tag team match against Ric Flair and Randy
   Savage.^[200][25] In late 1996, he feuded with [201]Diamond Dallas Page
   after defeating him in a match at [202]Clash of the Champions
   XXXIII.^[203][26] He started feuding with DDP to steal his
   [204]nickname of "Lord of the Ring" but lost.^[205][27] Guerrero
   participated in a tournament for the vacant WCW United States
   Heavyweight Championship in which he went on to defeat the likes of
   Konnan in the first round,^[206][28] Chris Benoit in the second
   round^[207][29] and rival DDP in the final round at [208]Starrcade 1996
   to win the United States title.^[209][30]^[210][31]^[211][32]

   In 1997, Eddie Guerrero defended the United States Heavyweight
   Championship against the likes of [212]Scott Norton at [213]Clash of
   the Champions XXXIV,^[214][33] [215]Syxx in a [216]ladder match at
   [217]Souled Out^[218][34] and [219]Chris Jericho at [220]SuperBrawl
   VII.^[221][35] His successful reign came to an end at [222]Uncensored
   when Dean Malenko defeated him for the title.^[223][36]

[[224]edit] Cruiserweight Division (1997-1998)

   After losing the United States Championship, Guerrero started a feud
   with Jericho focusing on Jericho's [225]WCW World Cruiserweight
   Championship. He challenged Jericho for the title at [226]Clash of the
   Champions XXXV but failed.^[227][37]

   Guerrero demanded a rematch for the title. In the opening match of
   [228]Fall Brawl 1997, Guerrero defeated Jericho to win the WCW World
   Cruiserweight Championship.^[229][38]^[230][39] He [231]dropped the
   Cruiserweight title to [232]Rey Misterio, Jr. at [233]Halloween Havoc
   in a [234]Title vs. Mask match where Misterio's mask was also on the
   line.^[235][40] On the November 10 edition of [236]Nitro, he regained
   the Cruiserweight title back from Mysterio,^[237][41]^[238][42] and
   made a successful title defense against Mysterio at [239]World War 3
   1997.^[240][43] Guerrero dropped the title to [241]ltimo Dragn on the
   December 29 episode of Nitro.^[242][44]

[[243]edit] Feuding with Chavo Guerrero (1998)

   Guerrero started a feud with [244]Booker T. On the March 9, 1998
   edition of Nitro, Guerrero's nephew [245]Chavo Guerrero lost to Booker
   in a match. After the match, Guerrero [246]suplexed Chavo to teach him
   a lesson.^[247][45] On the March 12 edition of [248]Thunder, he
   defeated his nephew Chavo in a match and forced him to become his
   "slave."^[249][46] At [250]Uncensored 1998, Chavo was forced to support
   Guerrero in the opening match of the pay-per-view where Guerrero faced
   Booker T for Booker's [251]WCW World Television Championship. Guerrero
   lost the match after receiving a [252]missile dropkick.^[253][47]
   Guerrero and Chavo began a feud with ltimo Dragn. Chavo lost to Dragn
   at [254]Spring Stampede 1998.^[255][48] At [256]Slamboree 1998,
   Guerrero defeated Dragn despite interference from Chavo.^[257][49]
   After the match, Chavo kissed Eddie and then started showing craziness.
   At [258]The Great American Bash 1998, Chavo got an upset victory over
   Guerrero.^[259][50] The two faced each other in a [260]Hair vs. Hair
   match at [261]Bash at the Beach 1998 which Guerrero won. Continuing to
   show his crazy behavior Chavo would shave his own head while Guerrero
   looked on in disbelief.^[262][51] Guerrero saved Chavo from beatings by
   [263]Stevie Ray and it seemed that he would align with Chavo but he
   wanted his release.^[264][52]

[[265]edit] Latino World Order (1998)

          Main article: [266]Latino World Order

   Despite Guerrero's success and popularity, he had been one of many
   wrestlers who were frustrated at never being given a chance to be main
   event stars in WCW. These frustrations came to a head when Guerrero
   requested that WCW President [267]Eric Bischoff either [268]push his
   character or give him a raise for family reasons. Bischoff responded by
   allegedly throwing [269]coffee at Guerrero (however, in his
   autobiography, Guerrero states that Bischoff accidentally knocked his
   coffee off the table and that it was a complete accident that he was
   hit). The wrestler, furious, demanded Bischoff release him from his WCW
   contract on a live episode of Nitro. Guerrero then left the company for
   a period of months, angry at Bischoff for what he had done. Guerrero
   later returned to WCW, leading to the belief that maybe Guerrero's
   angry speeches against Bischoff were actually a [270]work (Guerrero
   later confirmed it to be a [271]worked shoot). Guerrero would later
   contradict himself on WWE's [272]DVD Monday Night War claiming that he
   tried to put personal differences aside for the good of the company,
   yet found himself angry and outraged once more because of Bischoff's
   supposed continued refusal to elevate Guerrero and other similar
   wrestlers. He let [273]Brian Adams pin him and get an upset victory in
   a match.^[274][52]

   Guerrero responded to Bischoff's actions by forming the [275]Latino
   World Order (LWO), which was a take-off on Bischoff's [276]New World
   Order.^[277][53] The group was an answer to Bischoff's "refusal" to
   push Latino wrestlers in ways they felt they deserved.^[278][53] LWO
   was formed in October when Guerrero returned to WCW, and formed the LWO
   with [279]Hector Garza and [280]Damien.^[281][52] The group eventually
   grew to encompass almost all the Mexican wrestlers working for WCW at
   the time. They mainly feuded with Rey Misterio, Jr. and [282]Billy
   Kidman because they wanted Misterio to join the group. He faced Kidman
   in a match for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship but Misterio
   interfered and helped Kidman win the match and keep the
   title.^[283][52] However, Guerrero was involved in a serious car
   accident in 1999 that cut short the LWO storyline. Guerrero survived
   the accident and returned to wrestling in a matter of months.

[[284]edit] Filthy Animals (1999)

          Main article: [285]Filthy Animals

   After his return in the summer of 1999, Eddie helped create the
   [286]Filthy Animals stable with Rey Misterio, Jr. and [287]Konnan
   (later growing to include [288]Juventud Guerrera, Billy Kidman, and
   [289]Disco Inferno).^[290][54] They feuded with [291]Dead Pool
   ([292]Insane Clown Posse and [293]Vampiro). They received two straight
   victories over Dead Pool at [294]Road Wild 1999 and [295]Fall Brawl
   1999.^[296][55]^[297][56] They next feuded with [298]The Revolution
   ([299]Shane Douglas, [300]Chris Benoit, [301]Dean Malenko, and
   [302]Perry Saturn). Guerrero was victorious over Saturn by
   disqualification in a singles match at [303]Halloween Havoc
   1999.^[304][57] At [305]Mayhem 1999, the Animals lost to Revolution in
   a [306]mixed tag team elimination match.^[307][58] When [308]Vince
   Russo was fired as WCW Booker and replaced by [309]Kevin Sullivan,
   Guerrero asked for and received a release from his contract on January
   19.^[310][59] He signed with the [311]World Wrestling Federation (WWF)
   in 2000 along with WCW stars Benoit, Malenko, and Saturn.

[[312]edit] World Wrestling Federation (First run, 2000-2001)

[[313]edit] WWF Debut (2000)

   Guerrero and the other WCW wrestlers debuted in the WWF on the January
   31, 2000 edition of [314]Raw is War as [315]The Radicalz, interfering
   in a match including the [316]New Age Outlaws.^[317][60]^[318][61]
   During his first match with the WWF, a tag team bout pitting the
   Radicalz against the Outlaws, Guerrero performed his signature Frog
   Splash off the top rope and severely injured his elbow on the landing.
   As a result, he was sidelined for several weeks.^[319][61]

[[320]edit] Latino Heat and Mamacita (2000)

   In March 2000, Guerrero began pursuing the affections of [321]Chyna,
   who he referred to as his "Mamacita." Chyna initially rejected his
   advances, but allied with him following [322]WrestleMania 2000,
   declaring that she could not resist his "Latino
   Heat."^[323][61]^[324][62]

   Guerrero won his first WWF title on the April 3, 2000 edition of Raw is
   War by defeating Chris Jericho for the [325]WWF European Championship
   with help from Chyna.^[326][63]^[327][64] After Chyna abandoned Lita to
   be attacked by the Dudley Boyz, He and Chyna began a [328]feud with
   [329]Essa Rios and [330]Lita, which culminated in a European title
   defense at [331]Backlash 2000, which was also billed as the night of
   Guerrero's [332]prom (he was said to have just earned a [333]GED).
   Guerrero defeated Rios after arriving at ringside in a 1957
   [334]Chevrolet, even wrestling in his [335]tuxedo pants and a [336]bow
   tie.^[337][61]^[338][65] Guerrero successfully retained the title
   against former Radicalz friends Saturn and Malenko in a [339]triple
   threat match at [340]Judgment Day 2000,^[341][61]^[342][66] before
   finally losing the title to Saturn at [343]Fully Loaded
   2000.^[344][61]^[345][67]

   Over the next few months, friction began to build between Guerrero and
   Chyna. Chyna was upset when Guerrero pinned her to advance in the
   [346]King of the Ring tournament.^[347][61] At [348]SummerSlam 2000,
   Chyna won the Intercontinental Championship in a mixed tag
   match.^[349][61]^[350][68] They had also inserted themselves in the
   drama between Triple H, Stephanie, and Kurt Angle. Guerrero claimed to
   not mind and then begged Commissioner [351]Mick Foley to let him take
   part in a title defense between Chyna and [352]Kurt Angle on the
   September 4 edition of Raw is War, claiming he was afraid that Angle
   would injure Chyna. After Angle knocked Chyna down with the title belt,
   Guerrero "accidentally" [353]pinned her to win his first [354]WWF
   Intercontinental Championship while trying to revive
   her.^[355][61]^[356][69]^[357][64]

   Chyna became visibly uncomfortable as Guerrero began to cheat in order
   to retain his title, while Guerrero was upset that Chyna was posing for
   [358]Playboy [359]magazine, even trying to invade the [360]Playboy
   Mansion to stop the shooting.^[361][61] Just when it appeared that
   Chyna would leave Guerrero, he proposed to her and she
   accepted.^[362][61] At [363]Unforgiven 2000, Chyna helped Guerrero in
   retaining his title against [364]Rikishi.^[365][61]^[366][70] The
   engagement was called off when Guerrero was caught showering with two
   of [367]The Godfather's [368]hos (one of which would become
   [369]Victoria) claiming that "Two Mamacitas are better than
   one!"^[370][61]

[[371]edit] The Radicalz (2000-2001)

   Guerrero turned heel once again as a result of the incident and then
   the Radicalz reunited and feuded with the reformed [372]D-Generation X
   (Chyna, [373]Billy Gunn, [374]Road Dogg, and [375]K-Kwik). They
   defeated DX at [376]Survivor Series 2000 in an elimination tag team
   match and assisted [377]Triple H in his match with [378]Stone Cold
   Steve Austin.^[379][61]^[380][71] Guerrero was later defeated by Billy
   Gunn for the Intercontinental Championship, with help from
   Chyna.^[381][61] At [382]Rebellion 2000, Guerrero and Malenko lost to
   Gunn and Chyna.^[383][61]^[384][72] Benoit left the group to focus on a
   singles career while the rest of the Radicalz feuded with [385]Lita and
   [386]Hardy Boyz ([387]Matt and [388]Jeff). At [389]Armageddon 2000,
   Radicalz defeated Hardyz in a six-man elimination tag team
   match.^[390][61]^[391][73]

   In early 2001, Guerrero feuded with Chris Jericho, Benoit and
   [392]X-Pac over Jericho's Intercontinental Championship. At [393]No Way
   Out, the four men faced each other in a [394]fatal four way match,
   which Jericho won.^[395][74]^[396][75] Guerrero focused on the European
   Championship, feuding with the champion [397]Test. At [398]WrestleMania
   X-Seven, he defeated Test to win his second WWF European Championship
   with help from Saturn and Malenko.^[399][74]^[400][76]^[401][77]
   Throughout the month of April, Radicalz feuded with Test and his new
   partners. Guerrero eventually left the Radicalz, siding with the Hardy
   Boyz and Lita. At this point, Guerrero developed an addiction to pain
   medication stemming from his 1999 car accident and in May 2001 was sent
   to rehabilitation. To show his absence, a storyline was created where
   Guerrero was "injured" by [402]Prince Albert in a match.^[403][74] On
   November 9, 2001 he was arrested for [404]drunk driving and was
   subsequently released by the WWF three days later.

[[405]edit] Independent circuit (2001-2002)

   Eddie Guerrero started wrestling on the [406]independent circuit after
   his release from WWF. He wrestled in several independent promotions. On
   February 23, he faced fellow Mexican [407]Super Crazy on the debut show
   of [408]Ring of Honor known as The Era of Honor Begins to crown the
   first-ever [409]IWA Intercontinental Champion. Guerrero lost the
   match.^[410][78]^[411][79] On February 24, he debuted in the
   [412]Australian promotion [413]World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) at the
   pay-per-view event [414]Revolution beating the champion [415]Juventud
   Guerrera and [416]Psicosis in a triple threat match for the [417]WWA
   International Cruiserweight Championship.^[418][78]^[419][80] On March
   1, he defeated the champion [420]CM Punk and Rey Mysterio in a triple
   threat match for the [421]IWA Mid-South Heavyweight
   Championship.^[422][78]^[423][81] He dropped the title back to Punk one
   day later on March 2.^[424][78] He vacated the WWA Cruiserweight title
   in April 2002 after returning to WWF.^[425][78]

[[426]edit] World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (Second run, 2002-2005)

[[427]edit] Return to Raw (2002)

   Guerrero returned to WWF on the April 1, 2002 edition of Raw, attacking
   [428]Rob Van Dam.^[429][82]^[430][83] He started feuding with Van Dam.
   At [431]Backlash 2002, he defeated Van Dam for his second WWF
   Intercontinental Championship.^[432][82]^[433][84]^[434][85] After
   retaining the title against Van Dam in bouts at both [435]Insurrextion
   2002^[436][82]^[437][86] and [438]Judgment Day
   2002,^[439][87]^[440][88] he finally lost the belt to Van Dam on the
   May 27 edition on Raw in a [441]ladder match although a [442]drunk fan
   jumped in the ring knocking down the ladder that Guerrero was climbing
   causing both Guerrero and Van Dam to think up some new moves to
   continue the match without any mistakes.^[443][87]^[444][89] Guerrero
   then started a feud with [445]Steve Austin, but Austin left WWE before
   a match could take place.^[446][87] [447]Chris Benoit returned to WWE
   the night Guerrero lost the title and reunited with him. Guerrero and
   Benoit feuded with [448]Ric Flair for a while and Guerrero even lost a
   match to Flair at [449]King of the Ring 2002.^[450][87]^[451][90]
   Guerrero then went on to have a match with [452]The Rock, challenging
   him for the [453]WWE Undisputed Championship after The Rock sang a
   version of "[454]La Bamba" with the words changed to insult Guerrero on
   the July 29 edition of Raw.^[455][87]^[456][91]

[[457]edit] Los Guerreros (2002-2003)

          Main article: [458]Los Guerreros

   Guerrero lies on a corner, one of his characteristic traits.

   On August 1, 2002, Guerrero and Benoit began to wrestle exclusively for
   WWE's [459]SmackDown! [460]brand. Guerrero began feuding with
   [461]Edge, to whom he lost at [462]SummerSlam 2002.^[463][92]^[464][93]
   Eddie continued his feud with Edge, whom he defeated at [465]Unforgiven
   2002, they then had a No Disqualification match 2 weeks after
   Unforgiven on SmackDown which Edge won thus ending the
   rivalry.^[466][92]^[467][94] With Benoit starting to focus on [468]Kurt
   Angle, Guerrero aligned himself with his nephew [469]Chavo, forming the
   tag team [470]Los Guerreros.^[471][92]^[472][95] In contrast to a
   previous WCW storyline with his nephew, Chavo fully agreed with his
   uncle as their slogan stated "We lie, we cheat, and we steal, but at
   least we're honest about it." In order to push the new tag team,
   [473]vignettes were produced, which included things such as the two
   finagling their way into a rich lady's house and throwing a pool
   party.^[474][92]

   The duo entered the [475]eight-team tournament for the new Tag Team
   Championship, sneaking past [476]Rikishi and [477]Mark Henry in the
   opening round,^[478][95]^[479][92]^[480][96] before starting a feud
   with the newly formed tag team of Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit. In one
   of the team's definitive moments, Chavo told Benoit that his former
   friend Guerrero was assaulted by his tag team partner Angle. Benoit ran
   to make the save, only to have himself locked inside a room. Guerrero
   then appeared in the room and assaulted Benoit with a steel chair.
   Benoit and Angle managed to overcome their differences and eventually
   defeated Los Guerreros in the tournament
   semi-finals.^[481][95]^[482][92]^[483][97] Later on, Benoit and Angle
   won the titles. Benoit and Angle then fought for a trophy for being the
   first WWE Tag Team Champion. Much to Benoit's surprise, Los Guerreros
   helped him win the match.

   At [484]Survivor Series 2002, Los Guerreros faced the new champions
   Edge and [485]Rey Mysterio and the team of Angle and Benoit for the
   titles. Eddie made Mysterio submit to [486]The Lasso From El Paso to
   win their first [487]WWE Tag Team
   Championship.^[488][95]^[489][92]^[490][98]^[491][99] They were
   defeated by [492]Team Angle ([493]Charlie Haas and [494]Shelton
   Benjamin) on the February 6, 2003 edition of
   SmackDown!.^[495][100]^[496][101] Los Guerreros and Team Angle began
   feuding with each other. Los Guerreros participated at
   [497]WrestleMania XIX as contenders for the Tag Team Title, along with
   the team of Benoit and [498]Rhyno. Both teams lost to Haas and Benjamin
   in a Triple Threat Match.^[499][95]^[500][100]^[501][102] Guerrero
   participated in a #1 contender's tournament to the WWE Championship,
   where he lost to [502]John Cena in the first
   round.^[503][100]^[504][103] At [505]Backlash 2003, Los Guerreros lost
   to Team Angle in a rematch.^[506][95]^[507][100]^[508][104]

[[509]edit] Teaming with Tajiri (2003)

   5 days prior to [510]Judgment Day 2003, Chavo tore his biceps. This
   forced Guerrero to look for another partner. He chose [511]Tajiri. They
   won the WWE Tag Team Championship, both Guerrero's and Tajiri's second
   at Judgment Day by defeating Team Angle in a ladder
   match.^[512][100]^[513][105]^[514][106] The following week, Guerrero
   and Tajiri managed to retain their title by
   cheating.^[515][100]^[516][107] In addition, they also defeated
   [517]Roddy Piper and his proteg [518]Sean O'Haire in [519]Madison
   Square Garden.^[520][100]^[521][108] After Guerrero and Tajiri lost the
   title to Team Angle on the July 3 edition of SmackDown!, Guerrero
   turned on Tajiri, slamming his partner through the windshield of his
   low-rider truck.^[522][100]^[523][109]

   During the summer of 2003, Guerrero had begun driving a customized
   [524]lowrider to ringside as part of his ring entrance. Guerrero would
   also capitalize on his "Lie, Cheat, and Steal" [525]anti-hero image by
   brazenly using illegal tactics behind the referee's back to win matches
   on occasion. He was well known for hitting someone with a steel chair
   (or handing the opponent the steel chair and then pretending to be
   knocked out himself, just as the referee turned around), or using
   illegal weapons during the match. Despite (or possibly because of) his
   immoral tactics, Guerrero continued to increase in popularity.

[[526]edit] First WWE United States Champion (2003-2004)

   In July 2003, Guerrero competed in a tournament for the United States
   Championship. He managed to advance to the final round, defeating
   [527]ltimo Dragon and [528]Billy Gunn in the process,^[529][100] where
   he would meet [530]Chris Benoit.^[531][110]^[532][111] At
   [533]Vengeance 2003, Guerrero turned to his cheating tactics, hitting
   Benoit with the belt at one point in the match. Guerrero tried to get
   Benoit in trouble by placing the title belt on top of the unconscious
   Benoit. It did not work, however, since he knocked out the referee
   earlier with a belt shot to the kidneys. The match ended with
   interference and a [534]Gore from [535]Rhyno, Benoit's own partner, who
   was furious at the team's failure. Guerrero himself said that this was
   a major point in the character of Latino Heat, since he himself
   realized that the fans wanted to see him lie, cheat and steal. Guerrero
   pinned Benoit and won the [536]WWE United States
   Championship.^[537][100]^[538][112]^[539][113]

   At [540]SummerSlam 2003, Guerrero retained his title by defeating
   Rhyno, Benoit and Tajiri in a [541]Fatal Four Way
   match.^[542][100]^[543][114] He turned face again by engaging in a
   rivalry with [544]John Cena. On the September 11 edition of SmackDown!,
   Guerrero challenged Cena to a "Latino Heat" Parking Lot Brawl Match for
   the United States Championship, which Guerrero won with help from his
   returning nephew, Chavo.^[545][100]^[546][115] Next week, Los Guerreros
   defeated The World's Greatest Tag Team (previously Team Angle) to win
   the WWE Tag Team Championship for a second time, although it was
   Guerrero's third reign.^[547][95]^[548][100]^[549][116]^[550][117]
   Guerrero thus held the WWE United States Championship and one-half of
   the WWE Tag Team Championship concurrently.

   Guerrero engaged in a feud with [551]The Big Show, which involved
   Guerrero poisoning the Big Show with some [552]laxative laced
   [553]burritos and then later spraying the Big Show with a sewage
   truck.^[554][100]^[555][118]^[556][119] The feud ended when Guerrero
   dropped the United States title to Big Show at [557]No
   Mercy.^[558][100]^[559][120] Four days later, Los Guerreros lost the
   Tag Team Championship to the [560]Basham Brothers ([561]Doug and
   [562]Danny).^[563][95]^[564][100]^[565][121] They began feuding with
   Basham Brothers, to whom they lost in a title match at [566]Survivor
   Series 2003.^[567][95]^[568][100]^[569][122]

   As Los Guerreros attempted to regain the tag team title, things began
   to go downhill between Chavo and Guerrero and animosity began to build,
   although Kurt Angle did his best to get the team back on their feet.
   Chavo then attacked and turned on Guerrero after he suffered a beating
   from The Bashams.^[570][95]^[571][123]^[572][124] Guerrero feuded with
   Chavo and defeated him at [573]Royal Rumble 2004 to settle their
   feud.^[574][123]^[575][125]

[[576]edit] Main event push and WWE Champion (2004)

   When Chris Benoit defected to Raw after winning the [577]2004 Royal
   Rumble, using his title shot to go for [578]Triple H's [579]World
   Heavyweight Championship, Eddie won a 15-man Royal Rumble style match
   on the January 29, 2004 edition of SmackDown! to earn a shot at the WWE
   Championship.^[580][123]^[581][126]

   After becoming the number one contender, Guerrero elevated himself to
   the main event status and began feuding with the WWE Champion
   [582]Brock Lesnar. At [583]No Way Out 2004, Guerrero defeated Lesnar in
   the main event to win the [584]WWE
   Championship.^[585][123]^[586][127]^[587][128] The victory made him
   only the second-ever Latino WWE Champion in history (following
   [588]Pedro Morales), and the first Mexican American to win the main
   world title in an American promotion. His next feud was with [589]Kurt
   Angle, whom he defeated at [590]WrestleMania XX to retain his title in
   his first big defense.^[591][123]^[592][129] At the end of this event,
   Guerrero celebrated in the ring with longtime friend Chris Benoit, who
   had just won the World Heavyweight Championship.^[593][123]^[594][130]

   Guerrero went on to have smaller feuds with the likes of the [595]The
   Big Show and [596]Rey Mysterio.^[597][123] In March, he started a feud
   with fellow Texan [598]John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL) after JBL
   interrupted in Eddie's match with [599]Booker T.^[600][123]^[601][131]
   At [602]Judgment Day 2004, Guerrero defended his WWE title against JBL
   and retained the title after getting himself [603]disqualified because
   JBL had kayfabe given his mother a heart attack.^[604][123]^[605][132]
   At [606]The Great American Bash 2004, Guerrero defended the title
   against JBL in a [607]Texas Bullrope match. JBL won after Angle (who
   was General Manager of SmackDown! at the time) reversed the decision
   after Guerrero appeared to have retained the
   title.^[608][123]^[609][133] On the July 8 edition of SmackDown!,
   Guerrero pulled a switcharoo with [610]Shannon Moore, who was wrestling
   as "[611]El Gran Luchadore" and then Guerrero wore the
   costume.^[612][123]^[613][134] The next week on SmackDown!, Guerrero
   faced JBL in a [614]steel cage match for the WWE title where El Gran
   Luchadore appeared again and cost Guerrero the match. It was later
   proved to be Kurt Angle. Guerrero continued his feud with Angle
   again.^[615][123]^[616][135]

   At [617]SummerSlam 2004, Guerrero lost to Angle after submitting to his
   [618]ankle lock.^[619][123]^[620][136] Guerrero then allied himself
   with the Big Show. Each week Angle and his new allies [621]Luther
   Reigns and [622]Mark Jindrak began targeting Guerrero and Big Show.
   Guerrero defeated Reigns in a singles match at [623]No Mercy
   2004.^[624][123]^[625][137] [626]General Manager [627]Theodore Long
   booked a Survivor Series Elimination Match between a team led by
   Guerrero and a team led by Angle. Guerrero's team consisted of himself,
   Big Show, John Cena (replacing the originally chosen Rey Mysterio), and
   Rob Van Dam. At [628]Survivor Series 2004, Guerrero's team defeated
   Angle's team.^[629][123]^[630][138]

   Guerrero, along with Booker T and [631]The Undertaker, then challenged
   JBL for a WWE Championship rematch. Along the way, Guerrero found a
   partner in Booker T. At [632]Armageddon 2004, Guerrero and Booker's
   initial teamwork broke away, and the match ended with JBL pinning
   Booker following the [633]Clothesline From Hell.^[634][123]^[635][139]
   Afterwards, Guerrero and Booker briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to
   win the Tag Team Championship.^[636][123]^[637][140]

[[638]edit] Teaming and feuding with Rey Mysterio (2005)

   At [639]No Way Out, Eddie teamed up with longtime friend and sometimes
   rival, Rey Mysterio and defeated Basham Brothers to win his final
   title, the WWE Tag Team Championship for a fourth time, with being it
   Mysterio's third reign.^[640][141]^[641][142]^[642][143] Many expected
   the new champions to defend their title at [643]WrestleMania 21, but
   after encouragement from Chavo,^[644][141]^[645][144] instead Guerrero
   challenged Mysterio to a one-on-one match so they could "bring the
   house down."^[646][141]^[647][145] The two wrestled a match at
   WrestleMania with Mysterio getting the win. Although visibly
   frustrated, Guerrero congratulated his partner.^[648][141]^[649][146]
   After several mishaps in the weeks following WrestleMania, the growing
   tension between Guerrero and Mysterio finally erupted when they lost
   their tag team championship to the new team [650]MNM ([651]Johnny Nitro
   and [652]Joey Mercury) on the April 21 edition of
   SmackDown!.^[653][141]^[654][147] Although next week, they received a
   rematch to regain the titles, Guerrero turned heel once again by
   abandoning his partner, whom he had considered "his family" earlier in
   the show.^[655][141]^[656][148]
   Guerrero and Mysterio with the [657]WWE Tag Team Championship belts.

   At the end of one episode of SmackDown!, he attacked his former tag
   team partner, Mysterio, leaving him bruised and bloody after
   [658]suplexing him onto a set of steel steps. Guerrero, having turned
   heel, then adopted a new, somewhat [659]sociopathic gimmick. During
   this time, he also stopped driving his low-riders down the ring and
   walked to the ring with a frown on his face, and reverted to using the
   [660]Lasso from El Paso as his finishing move.^[661][141] At
   [662]Judgment Day, Guerrero lost to Mysterio by disqualification after
   hitting Mysterio with a chair.^[663][141]^[664][149]

   On the June 30 edition of SmackDown!, Guerrero threatened to reveal a
   secret about Mysterio and his son Dominick. The storyline grew to
   involve the families of both men, with both sides pleading for Guerrero
   not to reveal the secret.^[665][141]^[666][150] Mysterio defeated
   Guerrero again at [667]The Great American Bash, a match with a
   stipulation that if Guerrero lost, he would not tell the
   secret.^[668][141]^[669][151] Yet Guerrero revealed the secret anyway
   on the following episode of SmackDown! - telling Dominick and the
   audience that Guerrero was his real father. In the following weeks,
   Guerrero revealed the details of the secret in a series of what he
   called "Eddie's Bedtime Stories."^[670][141]^[671][152] During that
   time he now had a dark comical gimmick. He claimed that he had a child
   out of wedlock (Dominick) while his marriage was going through hard
   times. He claimed he then allowed Mysterio and his wife, who were
   "having trouble conceiving", to adopt the child as their
   own.^[672][141] At [673]SummerSlam, Guerrero lost a [674]ladder match
   over Dominick's custody to Mysterio.^[675][141]^[676][153] Their
   emotional feud ended at the premiere edition of SmackDown!, where
   Guerrero finally gained a victory over Mysterio in a steel cage
   match.^[677][141]^[678][154]

[[679]edit] Final storylines (2005)

   Following his feud with Rey Mysterio, Guerrero was named number one
   contender to the [680]World Heavyweight Championship and given a title
   match with [681]Batista. Despite this, Guerrero quickly proclaimed
   himself to be Batista's friend. Batista was wary of Guerrero, however,
   and a series of matches with MNM only supported his suspicions, as
   Guerrero appeared to have reverted to his cheating ways.^[682][141] In
   response to Batista's suspicions, Guerrero helped Batista win a match
   against his tag team partners, John "Bradshaw" Layfield and
   [683]Christian.^[684][141]^[685][155]

   Batista defeated Guerrero at [686]No Mercy to retain the World
   Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Guerrero struggled with a
   decision about whether or not to use a steel chair to secure the
   victory, eventually opting not to use it and losing as a
   result.^[687][141]^[688][156] Though the two demonstrated mutual
   respect after the match, Guerrero seemed displeased by the loss. The
   day of this event was Guerrero's birthday. After the show went off the
   air, Batista led the crowd singing "Happy Birthday" to him. Guerrero
   told Batista that he realized how low he had sunk since losing the WWE
   Championship in 2004, having attacked his best friend Rey Mysterio.
   Guerrero told Batista that shaking his hand at No Mercy had returned
   his respect to him.^[689][141] This turned Guerrero face again.

   Guerrero wrestled his final match on the November 11 edition of
   SmackDown!, defeating [690]Mr. Kennedy to qualify for a place on the
   SmackDown! team at the [691]Survivor Series, in a match that he would
   not participate due to his death.^[692][141]^[693][157] [694]Randy
   Orton was named as the official replacement for Guerrero on the
   team.^[695][158]

[[696]edit] Death

   On November 13, 2005, Guerrero was found unconscious in his hotel room
   (The Marriott City Center) in [697]Minneapolis, Minnesota, by his
   nephew, [698]Chavo. Chavo attempted CPR, but Guerrero was pronounced
   dead when paramedics arrived on the scene.

   An [699]autopsy revealed that Guerrero died as a result of acute
   [700]heart failure [701]arteriosclerotic [702]cardiovascular disease.
   Guerrero's wife [703]Vickie claimed that he had been unwell in the week
   preceding his death. On the November 30 edition of WWE Byte This!,
   Chavo said that Guerrero had been working hard and was at peak
   [704]physical fitness as a result, doing [705]cardiovascular and
   [706]weight training exercises every day.

[[707]edit] Aftermath

   Guerrero was set to face [708]Batista and [709]Randy Orton in a triple
   threat match for the [710]World Heavyweight Championship on the
   November 13, 2005 taping of SmackDown! (which would have aired on
   November 18, 2005).

   The episodes of [711]Raw on November 14, 2005 and SmackDown! on
   November 18, 2005 each aired as tributes to Guerrero. No WWE employees
   were forced to perform, although several matches took place, including
   one featuring Chavo, who finished the match with his uncle's frog
   splash. Raw started off with all the superstars and several personnel
   on stage, as [712]Vince McMahon addressed the live crowd. A video was
   then shown featuring many clips of Guerrero in and out of the ring.
   This was also one of the rare instances in which SmackDown superstars
   appeared on RAW, and RAW superstars appeared on SmackDown.

   In addition to the Raw and SmackDown! tribute shows, [713]Total Nonstop
   Action Wrestling dedicated the [714]pay-per-view [715]TNA Genesis
   (which aired the evening of his death) to Guerrero,^[716][159] while
   [717]Ring of Honor named their next show "Night of Tribute."^[718][160]
   NECW (New England Championship Wrestling) also honored the fallen star
   with a tribute video and their show in his honor.

   Guerrero was inducted into the [719]WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006
   by [720]Rey Mysterio, his nephew [721]Chavo Guerrero, and [722]Chris
   Benoit in [723]Chicago, Illinois on the night before [724]WrestleMania
   22.^[725][3] His widow, [726]Vickie, accepted the honor. Guerrero also
   appears in the video games, [727]WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 and
   [728]WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 ([729]PSP version only) as a legend.

   On every house show on the European tour in cities of [730]Germany
   ([731]Leipzig, [732]Berlin, [733]Nuremberg), a ten-bell salute occurred
   and fans stood up in silence to honor Guerrero who died several days
   before the event. The same happened in the Mexican tour. The cities of
   [734]Monterrey, [735]Guadalajara and [736]Mexico City shouted
   dramatically during each function on behalf of Guerrero and Rey
   Mysterio in each one said a word in his memory.

   Eventually, other wrestlers (primarily Chavo, Mysterio, and
   [737]Christian Cage) paid tribute to him in their matches by using the
   Frog Splash, Eddie's finisher.

   On November 11, 2008, WWE released Viva La Raza: The Legacy of Eddie
   Guerrero on DVD. A special edition DVD set was also released on this

[[742]edit] Sports Illustrated steroid investigation

   On March 19, 2007, [743]Sports Illustrated posted on its website an
   article in its continuing series investigating a steroid and [744]HGH
   ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. This
   article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including
   Guerrero, who was alleged to have obtained [745]hCG and the
   [746]steroid [747]stanozolol in early 2005.^[748][161] At the time of
   the alleged steroid usage, the WWE had not yet instated its Wellness
   Policy in which wrestlers are tested for substances, which was stated
   by WWE.com on the day the article was released.

[[749]edit] Other appearances

   On March 13, 2004 (before [750]WrestleMania XX), Guerrero ([751]WWE
   Champion), along with [752]The Big Show ([753]United States Champion),
   [754]Trish Stratus and [755]Chris Jericho, made their guest appearances
   on [756]MADtv as they "beat up" [757]Jay Leno ([758]Frank Caliendo)
   while [759]Tonight Show Band leader [760]Kevin Eubanks ([761]Aries
   Spears) watched.

     * Winning tactics

   Guerrero was known for his "I Lie, I Cheat, I Steal" motto where he
   often wins matches by using cheating tactics. Common tactics were:
     * Playing possum while opponent holds a steel chair, appearing that
       the opponent had attacked him. With this usually the referee was
       already knocked out, and whilst playing possum, Eddie would sit up
       and try and shake the referee awake.
     * Smashing the chair on the mat to make it sound like someone was hit
       then tossing the chair to his opponent, whilst lying on the ground
       pretending to be have actually been hit.
     * Low blowing the opponent while the referee replaces steel chair.
     * With his tag team partner locked in a submission hold, Eddie would
       ring the ring bell to fool his opponent into thinking Eddie's
       partner had submitted and the match had ended, causing the opponent
       to release the hold.
     * Also, when champion or facing a champion in a non title match,
       Eddie would sometimes use the championship belt in a similar way to
       the steel chair, by throwing it to his opponent and lying on the
       mat pretending to have been hit by it.
