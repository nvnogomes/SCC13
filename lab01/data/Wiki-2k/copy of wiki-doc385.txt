   Drayton Beauchamp (pronounced 'Beecham') is a [38]village and is also a
   [39]civil parish within [40]Aylesbury Vale district in
   [41]Buckinghamshire, [42]England. It is in the east of the county, near
   the border with [43]Hertfordshire, about six miles from [44]Aylesbury
   and two miles from [45]Tring.

   The village name 'Drayton' is [46]Anglo Saxon in origin and means 'farm
   where sledges are used'. It is a common place name in England, and
   refers to places that were perched on the hillside, thus requiring the
   use of a sledge rather than a cart to pull heavy loads. The suffix
   'Beauchamp' refers to the ancient [47]manorial family of the parish.
   The village is intersected by the [48]Icknield Way a prehistoric,
   long-distance trackway of significant importance in providing a trading
   route between [49]East Anglia and the [50]Thames Valley certainly
   during the [51]Iron Age and maybe earlier. In more recent times it has
   been bisected by the [52]Roman Road, [53]Akeman Street now the [54]A41
   and by both the [55]Aylesbury Arm and [56]Wendover Arm of the [57]Grand
   Union Canal.

   Following the [58]Norman Conquest [59]William I awarded land which
   later became known as Drayton Beauchamp to Robert, Earl of Morton who
   as Magno le Breton had accompanied William at the time of the
   [60]Norman Invasion in 1066. The Morton family founded a church at
   Drayton on the site where the present-day church of St Mary the Virgin
   now stands. During the early part of 13^th century the manor was owned
   by William de Beauchamp (de Bello Campo). The lands were passed from
   the Beauchamp family to the Cobhams. [61]Sir John Cobham gave the
   property to King [62]Edward III. The King granted it to his
   shield-bearer [63]Thomas Cheney (also spelt Cheyne) in 1364. It
   remained in the Cheyne family until the death of William Cheyne, Lord
   [64]Viscount Newhaven in 1728.

   During the period after 1066 in which the Lord of the Manor of Drayton
   was Magno le Breton the southern end of the manor would have been
   valued for its summer pasture. This area which became known later as
   [65]Cholesbury contained a large [66]Iron Age [67]Hillfort. This
   gradually became a permanent settlement and was subsequently separated
   off as a separate manor. In 1541 it was sold by Robert Cheyne to
   [68]Chief Justice John Baldwin and became an autonymous manor.

   Drayton Beauchamp was sold by the Cheyne family to John Gumby in 1730
   and subsequently the manor house and lands were inherited by Lady
   Robert Manners. The manor house has since been pulled down. In 1837 it
   passed to Mrs. Caroline Jenney and remained in that family until the
   death of Miss Airmyne Harpur-Cruewe in 1999.

   The church was extensively rebuilt in 15^th century from materials
   salvaged from the earlier church. Most notable is the Norman font which
   dates back to the 12th century. The first rector of the new Church was
   [69]Richard Hooker who took up his incumbency in 1584. Richard is today
   remembered for his writings in particular a four volume work known as
   [70]Of the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie.

   In 1934 Drayton Beauchamp ceded a small parcel of land, adjacent to the
   previously detached parish of Cholesbury to the new parish of
   [71]Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards
