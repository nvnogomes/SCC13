   The Ebbw Valley Line is a [107]railway spur of the [108]Great Western
   Main Line in [109]South Wales^[110][1]. The line closed to passenger
   traffic on [111]30 April [112]1962^[113][2], remaining open for freight
   services only, but was restored to passenger service between 20062008.
   Passenger trains recommenced on [114]6 February
   [115]2008^[116][3]^[117][4] initially to [118]Cardiff Central, with a
   service to [119]Newport at a later date.

[[128]edit] Restoration of passenger service

   The restoration project was developed as a response to the closures of
   steelworks in Ebbw Vale and Newport, and the resulting economic
   downturn. The project was jointly funded by [129]Blaenau Gwent and
   [130]Caerphilly County Borough Councils, [131]Newport City Council, the
   [132]Welsh Assembly Government and [133]Network Rail.^[134][5] Capita
   Symonds were project managing the scheme^[135][6] and the project
   contractor was Amey Rail, a subsidiary of [136]Amey plc. New stations
   and services are operated by [137]Arriva Trains Wales, the existing
   train operating company in the region. The local authorities own and
   operate the station car parks.

[[138]edit] Phase One

   The first passenger train service started on [139]6 February [140]2008
   at 6.30 a.m., between the Ebbw Valley line and Cardiff.^[141][4] The
   service is an hourly passenger service between Ebbw Vale and Cardiff.
   Dedicated [142]feeder bus services link the line to Ebbw Vale and
   Abertillery town centres. Feeder buses also operated to [143]Newport
   City Centre from Rogerstone Station but were discontinued on [144]June
   1, [145]2008.^[146][7]. Due to delays in construction Llanhilleth and
   Crosskeys stations did not open until [147]27 April [148]2008 and
   [149]7 June [150]2008 respectively.

   The works included upgrading the existing track to passenger standard,
   including reinstatement of 3 miles of double track, new colour light
   signalling, level crossing renewal and construction of six new
   stations.

   The number of passengers using the service in the first four months has
   exceeded the target set for the entire first year. Over 200,000 people
   have travelled on the line since its opening and based on current usage
   passenger numbers will comfortably exceed the fourth-year target of
   453,000.^[151][8]

[[152]edit] Phase Two

   This article or section contains information about planned or expected
   [153]public transport in the [154]United Kingdom.
   It may contain information of a speculative nature and the content may
   change significantly as more information becomes available.

   A future proposal for the line includes the introduction of a second
   hourly service to [155]Newport. Before this link could begin the line
   will have doubled between Aberbeeg Junction and [156]Crosskeys with new
   platforms constructed at Llanhilleth and Newbridge railway stations.

   Significant signalling problems in Newport are also suggested to exist
   at Park Junction and Gaer Junction. A feasibility study mentioned in
   the Route Utilisation Consultation funded by Network Rail is currently
   under way to assess the costs of this enhancement. It is expected that
   the Welsh Assembly Government would meet the bulk of the costs of the
   future enhancements, and on 10 September the WAG duly announced funding
   to cure the problems, with an expected completion date of 2010.

   Some of the problems will be removed during the Newport Area
   Re-signalling process, however because of the obstacles the project as
   present is referred to as an "aspiration". This means that no firm
   commitment exists at present. It is likely that an announcement on the
   future of the project would be in the next few years. Implementation is
   likely to be between 2010-2018 to coincide with the completion of the
   Newport Area re-signalling works.

[[157]edit] Works programme

   A start of main works event was held in [158]Crumlin on [159]28
   September [160]2006^[161][9] and was attended by [162]Andrew Davies
   (Welsh Assembly Minister for Enterprise, Innovation and Networks) the
   leaders of Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly County Borough Councils
   together with AMs Irene James and Trish Law, local councillors,
   officers and project stakeholders.^[163][9] The event marked the start
   of major works on the scheme with a demonstration of a new rail ballast
   cleaner.

   Services began on Wednesday [164]6 February [165]2008 with an hourly
   service in each direction between Cardiff Central and Ebbw Vale
   Parkway.

   The first train on the line was packed with officials for the official
   opening, Deputy First Minister [166]Ieuan Wyn Jones opened the line
   along with [167]Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council's former Labour
   leader Hedley McCarthy. Islwyn AM [168]Irene James was also present for
   the opening, but Blaenau Gwent AM [169]Trish Law was absent. The first
   train was waved off at Ebbw Vale Parkway by local residents which
   welcomed the link as a positive contribution to the valley's long term
   regeneration.^[170][4]
