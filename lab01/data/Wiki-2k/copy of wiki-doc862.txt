   Edgar Samuel David Graham MPA, [14]BL (1954 [15]7 December [16]1983)
   was an [17]Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) politician and academic from
   [18]Northern Ireland. He was perceived as a rising star of both legal
   studies and unionism until he was killed on 7 December 1983 by the
   [19]Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).

[[26]edit] Career

   A graduate (with 1st class honours) of the [27]University of Oxford,
   Edgar Graham was called to the Northern Irish Bar. He became a member
   of the [28]Queen's University Belfast law faculty (from 1979),
   lecturing in public law, and was a professional colleague of [29]David
   Trimble. A former Chairman of the [30]Ulster Young Unionist Council,
   Graham was widely seen as a possible future leader of the UUP.

   A member of the [31]Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party in the 1970s,
   he, along with David Trimble, moved into the [32]Ulster Unionist Party,
   and as head of the youth wing, he was critical of both the British
   government's perceived indecisiveness and (more quietly) the UUP
   leadership under [33]James Molyneaux^[34][1]

   Graham was elected a member of the [35]1982 Northern Ireland Assembly
   for [36]South Belfast.

[[37]edit] Death

   In mid-morning on [38]7 December [39]1983, while chatting to UUP party
   and Queen's colleague [40]Dermot Nesbitt at the University Square side
   of the main campus library, he was shot in the head a number of times
   by an IRA gunman and died almost instantly. He was 29 years old. Two
   persons were later convicted of withholding evidence from the British
   police, but no one was ever convicted for his murder.^[41][2]

   In a communique taking responsibility for the killing, the IRA command
   said his killing should be a salutary lesson to those loyalists who
   stand foursquare behind the laws and forces of oppression of the
   nationalist people. IRA members said that Graham was targeted because
   of aid and advice he had reportedly given to the [42]Northern Ireland
   Prison Service^[43][3]

   Graham had also gained notoriety for his strong public support of
   [44]internment, the revocation of [45]Special Category Status for
   [46]republican prisoners, and the British government's network of
   informers.^[47][3]^[48][4].

   He had been seen on the [49]BBC Northern Ireland Service, criticising
   the [50]Thatcher government for not taking a hard enough line against
   [51]Republican prisoners and hunger strikers.^[52][5]

   After Graham's killing, an expression of sympathy was made by
   [53]Seanad ireann

     I would like the Seanad to note with horror and dismay the death of
     the Assemblyman, Edgar Graham, who was murdered outside Queen's
     University, Belfast, this morning. It has been said by a noted
     writer that in the death of every man each of us dies a little. I
     think this is horribly true for us here in Ireland today that for
     every one of these victims of violence not only do we die a little
     but our hopes for our country die a little with every one of these
     outrages.

   The resultant Assembly by-election on [54]1 March 1984 was won
   unopposed by then [55]Ulster Unionist Party Chief Executive [56]Frank
   Millar Jr.^[57][6]

   The UUP leader, [58]Lord Molyneaux remarked

     "Had Mr. Graham not been murdered he would have become the leader of
     our party, such was his calibre." ^[59][7]

   In honour and remembrance to Edgar Graham there is a inscription at the
   entrance of the debating hall at Stormont that reads:

     "IN MEMORY OF EDGAR SAMUEL DAVID GRAHAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BELFAST
     SOUTH 1982-1983. SHOT BY TERRORISTS ON 7 DECEMBER 1983. 'KEEP ALIVE
     THE LIGHT OF JUSTICE'."^[60][8]

[[61]edit] Repercussions

   Graham's death came just two years after the IRA assassination of the
   South Belfast M.P. [62]Robert Bradford. To this day, Graham is often
   spoken of by Unionist political leaders.

          [63]David Trimble

     Some had been targeted by republicans because of their involvement
     in Unionist politics. Many knew Robert Bradford and Edgar Graham
     both murdered for defending the Union. Despite this they were
     prepared to share power with Sinn Fin. This displayed a magnanimity,
     and generosity of spirit which unfortunately has not yet been
     reciprocated by republicans. When we jumped first and established
     the devolved Executive last November, the IRA just sat on its guns
     and did nothing with the result that the British Government had to
     suspend the Executive.

          [64]Ian Paisley Junior, 20 May 2007.

     "Queens University is today a very different place than it was in
     the mid 80s when I matriculated. At the height of the troubles, post
     the hunger strikes and shortly after the murder of Edgar Graham not
     far from this hall. It was for many Protestants an inhospitable
     place ... [H]e would honour the memory of men like [65]Sir Norman
     Stronge, his son [66]James, Councillor Charlie Armstrong, the
     Reverend Robert Bradford, [67]Senator John Barnhill, and Edgar
     Graham who were killed by thugs under the guise of a perverted
     political philosophy ... [T]he RUC officer who trained Edgar Graham
     in the use of a personal firearm, just weeks before his untimely
     murder, told me that he would not have known what hit him, for it
     happened so quickly and was done from behind, in a cowardly fashion.
     Members here today know what hit Edgar Graham, and who organised the
     attack. I sat this morning, with my head bowed, as we witnessed an
     attempt by Her Majesty's Government to place in positions of power
     those who signed Mr Graham's death warrant. Those who, this morning,
     were put forward for positions in the Government of Northern Ireland
     have been responsible for terrorising the very community over which
     they were to exercise authority."

          [68]Families Acting for Innocent Relatives

     "It is also puzzling for Unionists why Sinn Fin/IRA are campaigning
     so vigorously to defend the reputation of Mr Finucane as that of a
     "human rights lawyer" whilst justifying their murder of the
     Protestant Human Rights Lawyer, Mr Edgar Graham at Queen's
     University."

     "The most predictable unionist reaction focuses on the demand that
     more attention be paid to those murdered by the IRA over the years
     such as law lecturer Edgar Graham and members of the judiciary
     including Judges Conaghan, Doyle and Gibson (and his wife), and
     Resident Magistrates Staunton, McBirney and the daughter of a
     Resident Magistrate, Mary Travers, killed during an attack on her
     father. Why, it is argued, are there no demands for international
     independent inquiries in these and other cases? Why the focus on Pat
     Finucane and Rosemary Nelson? The argument completely misses the
     point. There are no allegations that members of the security forces
     routinely issued death threats, demonised, had prior knowledge of or
     colluded in any way in these murders. There is no suggestion that
     the security forces were less than thorough in the subsequent
     investigations. At times it is necessary to state the obvious."

   [69]David Trimble has invoked his friend's killing to show both that
   the Unionist community had suffered greatly at the hands of
   republicans, and that more moderate Unionists were willing to take bold
   moves (especially support for the [70]Good Friday Agreement) and were
   willing put their suffering behind them. ^[71][9]

   Journalist [72]Ed Moloney, in his 2003 book, "A Secret History of the
   IRA", contends that Graham's killing was ordered by a restive IRA unit,
   the [73]Belfast Brigade and [74]Ivor Bell, as part of a campaign that
   was a direct challenge to [75]Sinn Fin leader [76]Gerry Adams' call for
   a more "controlled and disciplined" campaign twined with a growing
   parliamentary strategy. Moloney argues that Belfast area attacks by the
   IRA in late 1983, because of their backlash in the middle classes of
   both communities, in fact strengthened Adams and Sinn Fin's political
   path.^[77][10]

   Ironically, despite Graham's murder, violence in Northern Ireland
   actually continued in a pattern of decline in 1983, with 77 deaths,
   down from 97 the previous year.^[78][11] The British Army suffered only
   five deaths in 1983, its lowest number since 1971, while combined
   security services suffered 33 deaths (a drop from 40 the year before),
   and civilian deaths were recorded as 44, the lowest number since
   1970.^[79][12]

     University Square, Belfast, Mr. Graham was shot dead. The murder was
     claimed by the Irish Republican Army. RUC investigations resulted in
     one person being convicted of making property available and
     withholding information and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment
     suspended for 3 years. Another person, convicted of withholding
