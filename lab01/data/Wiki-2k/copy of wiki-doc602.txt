E. Fuller Torrey

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edwin Fuller Torrey, M.D. (b.[8]September 6, [9]1937, [10]Utica,
   [11]New York), is an [12]American [13]psychiatrist and
   [14]schizophrenia researcher. He is Executive Director of the
   [15]Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) and founder of the
   [16]Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), a nonprofit organization with the
   goals of eliminating legal and clinical obstacles to the treatment of
   severe mental illness.^[17][1]

   Dr. Torrey has conducted numerous research studies, particularly on
   possible infectious causes of schizophrenia. He has become well-known
   as an advocate of the idea that severe mental illness is due to
   biological factors and not social factors.^[18][2] He has appeared on
   national radio and television outlets and written for many newspapers.
   He has received two Commendation Medals by the U.S. Public Health
   Service and numerous other awards and tributes. He has been criticized
   by a range of people, including federal researchers and others for some
   of his views regarding their poor treatment of the mentally ill and
   waste of research dollars.^[19][3] He has also been described as having
   a black-and-white view of mental illness and as being [20]iconoclastic,
   [21]dogmatic, single-minded and a [22]renegade.^[23][4]

   Torrey is on the board of the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), which
   describes itself as being "a national [24]nonprofit [25]advocacy
   organization. [26][1] TAC supports [27]involuntary treatment when
   deemed appropriate by a judge (at the urging of the person's
   psychiatrist and family members). Torrey has written several
   best-selling books on [28]mental illness, including Surviving
   Schizophrenia.

[[40]edit] Education and early career

   Torrey earned his bachelor's degree, [41]magna cum laude, from
   [42]Princeton University, and his [43]medical doctor's degree from the
   [44]McGill University School of Medicine. Torrey also earned a master's
   degree in [45]anthropology from [46]Stanford University, and was
   trained in psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. At
   McGill and later at Stanford, he was exposed to a biological approach
   and recalls that one of his first-year instructors at McGill was
   [47]Hans Lehman, the first clinician in North America to use the first
   antipsychotic, [48]chlorpromazine. The medical school was housed next
   door to the [49]Montreal Neurological Institute, a premier neuroscience
   center.^[50][5]

   Torrey then practiced general medicine in [51]Ethiopia for two years as
   a [52]Peace Corps physician and in the South [53]Bronx. From 1970 to
   1975, he was a special administrative assistant to the NIMH director.
   He then worked for year in [54]Alaska in the Indian Health Service. He
   then became a ward physician at [55]St. Elizabeths Hospital for the
   mentally ill in [56]Washington, D.C.^[57][3] for nine years, where he
   reportedly worked with the most challenging patients and aimed to avoid
   the use of seclusion or restraints on the acute admission
   units.^[58][5] He also volunteered at Washington homeless
   clinics.^[59][6]

[[60]edit] Stanley Medical Research Institute

   Torrey is the founder and Executive Director for Laboratory Research of
   the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI), a large, private
   provider of research on schizophrenia and [61]bipolar disorder in the
   US. SMRI also maintains a collection of postmortem [62]brain tissue
   from individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major
   [63]depression and from unaffected controls, which are made available
   to researchers without charge.

   After reading Torrey's book "Surviving Schizophrenia", [64]Theodore
   Stanley, a businessman who had made a fortune in direct-mail marketing
   and whose son had been diagnosed in the late 1980s with bipolar
   disorder, contacted Torrey and he and his wife provided the funds for
   the new institute.[65][2]

   As of 2004 the Stanley Institute had 30 employees and funded half of
   all U.S. research on bipolar disorder and about a quarter of all
   schizophrenia research. In 2003 the institute's rapidly growing
   research budget exceeded $40 million, 74 percent of which was given out
   to other researchers through grants.[66][3] It reports that 75% of its
   expenditure goes towards the development of new treatments.[67][4]

   The Stanley Medical Institute in Bethesda Maryland has collected in
   excess of 600 brains [68]PDF In ARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY/VOL 61, NOV 2004,
   in a report called, "Brain Anatomy in Adults With Velocardiofacial
   Syndrome With and Without Schizophrenia", SMRI published results of a
   Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study showing difference in brain
   structure of people with and without schizophrenia.

   The SMRI has been sued for allegedly taking brains for use in research
   without proper consent. One lawsuit was settled out of
   court.[69][5][70][6]

   As of 2008 SMRI reports that it is concentrating its resources towards
   the support of its [71]Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, which
   plans to scan the entire genome for variants that predispose to
   schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and screen hundreds of thousands of
   compounds against new molecular targets prior to clinical
   testing.[72][7]

   SMRI reports that it has a close relationship with and is the
   supporting organization for the [73]Treatment Advocacy Center
   (TAC).[74][8]

[[75]edit] Treatment Advocacy Center

   Torrey is a founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a national
   organization that supports [76]outpatient commitment for certain people
   with mental illness who, in his view of their treatment history and
   present circumstances, are judged unlikely to survive safely in the
   community without supervision. TAC has been credited by [77]New York
   State Attorney General [78]Eliot Spitzer and others with helping pass
   [79]Kendra's Law in the state. Kendra's Law allows court-ordered
   involuntary treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other
   severe mental illness who have a history of noncompliance with
   psychiatric advice, i.e., individuals who are, "as a result of his or
   her mental illness, unlikely to voluntarily participate in the
   recommended treatment pursuant to the treatment plan."[80][9]
   Previously, only inpatient programs were available to submit a person
   to involuntary treatment. TAC's efforts to pass Kendra's Law led to
   similar successful passage of [81]Laura's Law in [82]California, and
   similar laws in [83]Florida and elsewhere. Torrey has testified
   numerous times in front of Congress.

[[84]edit] National Alliance on Mental Illness

   Torrey was for many years an active advisor for the [85]National
   Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Parents felt that he spoke up for
   them when much of the medical establishment had previously held that
   parenting was responsible for schizophrenia. Torrey helped build NAMI
   into a powerful political force through campaigning and donating the
   hardcover royalties from the sale of his book "Surviving
   Schizophrenia".^[86][6]

   Although Torrey, TAC, and NAMI remain aligned, NAMI may have tried to
   distance itself from TAC in 1998. One source The Psychiatric Times,
   reported that TAC was designed from the start to be "a separate support
   organization with its own source of funding."[87][10] According to
   [88]MindFreedom International, an association of survivors of
   psychiatric treatment opposed to involuntary treatment, NAMI severed
   its relationship with TAC because of pressure from groups opposed to
   Torrey both from within NAMI and outside NAMI. Torrey is, according to
   MindFreedom, one of 'the most feverishly pro-force psychiatrists in the
   world'. MindFreedom suggests that the 'links between NAMI and TAC are
   simply going from overt to covert.'

   In response to a [89]Morley Safer [90]60 Minutes piece in 2002, NAMI
   provided Torrey with a partial defense of comments made by Torrey on 60
   Minutes defending NIMH programs Torrey attacked, such as a study on
   adolescent romantic relationships and studies on the brains of snails,
   newts and birds but NAMI stated also Torrey was for 'true recovery'.
   [91][11].

   Torrey was also the keynote speaker at the 23rd annual NAMI convention
   in 2002. [92][12].

   In 2005, NAMI gave Dr. Torrey a tribute on its 25th Anniversary
   Celebratory Donor Wall, for those who have donated over $25,000. It
   called him a groundbreaking researcher, a ferociously resolute
   advocate, a prominent and admired author of dozens of books and a
   dedicated practicing clinician, and said that he had "touched the lives
   of countless NAMI members throughout this nation."[93][13]

   NAMI has some continuing links to TAC via their board of directors. One
   individual, Frederick Frese, is presently on both the NAMI and TAC
   boards. TAC has two other former NAMI board members on their board and
   Laurie Flynn, the former NAMI executive director, is part of the TAC
   Honorary Advisory Committee.^[[94]citation needed]

   In 2008, Torrey disagreed with a NAMI view on second-generation
   antipsychotics and accused the medical director and executive director
   of failing to disclose conflicts of interest, because they are
   employees of an organization that receives more than half its budget
   from pharmaceutical companies. He argued they were not representing the
   views of many members of NAMI including himself.^[95][7]

[[96]edit] Scientific research and views

   In the 1950s, it was commonly thought schizophrenia was caused by 'bad
   parenting'. The fact that his sister, Rhoda, had been diagnosed with
   schizophrenia in 1957, and Torrey himself was not, led him to question
   evidence for this theory. He felt that the view had a toxic effect on
   their mother. Rhoda subsequently lived for ten years in community
   [97]supported housing but has spent much of the time for five decades
   as an inpatient in [98]psychiatric hospital; Fuller has described her
   as still anything but well, attributing this to her having a severe
   form of schizophrenia.^[99][5]

   Torrey has been a fierce opponent of the influence of [100]Freud and
   [101]psychoanalysis. He has also argued that [102]psychiatry should
   focus only on severe mental illness, conceived as neurological
   disorders, rather than other mental issues that he viewed as
   non-medical.^[103][8]^[104][9]

   Torrey was principal investigator of a [105]NIMH Schizophrenia/Bipolar
   Disorder Twin Study conducted at the Neuroscience center of St
   Elizabeth's Hospital in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and copublished
   more than a dozen studies on structural brain differences between
   affected and unaffected siblings.^[106][5] He differed from his
   collaborators in arguing that the genetic [107]heritability of
   schizophrenia was lower than typically estimated.^[108][8]^[109][10] A
   review of Torrey's data analysis, however, suggested he had erroneously
   compared different sorts of concordance statistics.^[110][11]

   In the early 1970s, Torrey became interested in viral infections as
   possible causes of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, particularly a
   parasite [111]toxoplasma gondii found in domestic cats that can lead to
   [112]Toxoplasmosis.^[113][8] Up to one third of the world's population
   is estimated to carry a Toxoplasma infection.^[114][12] Since then he
   has published, often with [115]Robert Yolken, more than 30 articles on
   seasonal variation and possible infectious causes of schizophrenia,
   focusing especially on Toxoplasma gondii. He is involved in five or six
   ongoing studies using anti-Toxoplasmosa gondii agents (e.g. antibiotics
   such as [116]minocycline and [117]azithromycin[118][14][119][15]) as an
   add-on treatment for schizophrenia. He believes that infectious causes
   will eventually explain the "vast majority" of schizophrenia
   cases.^[120][5] Some of his collaborators have disagreed with the
   emphasis he has placed on infection as a direct causal factor.^[121][8]
   Many of the research studies on links between schizophrenia and
   Toxoplasma gondii, by different authors in different countries, are
   funded and supported by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. The
   hypothesis is not prominent in current mainstream scientific views on
   the [122]causes of schizophrenia, although infections may be seen as
   one possible risk factor that could lead to vulnerabilities in early
   neurodevelopment in some cases.

   Torrey has generally been in favor of [123]antipsychotic drugs. He has
   claimed that taking antipsychotics reduces the risk of violence,
   homelessness and prison. He has argued that "noncompliance" in about
   half of cases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is due to lack of
   "insight" into the illness because the part of the brain for
   self-awareness has been affected; and that in some who are aware it is
   due to adverse effects ranging from tremors or sedation to sexual
   dysfunction to substantial weight gain.^[124][13] He has also reported
   that at least some antipsychotics cause medical conditions in some
   people that can be fatal, especially [125]African Americans.[126][16]
   He has also argued that pharmaceutical companies have too much
   influence over psychiatric organizations and psychiatrists, effectively
   buying them off.^[127][14]

   Torrey has advocated in favor of a flexible well-funded range of
   [128]community mental health services, including [129]Assertive
   Community Treatment, [130]clubhouses (staffed by professionals with
   consumers as members), [131]supported housing and [132]supported
   employment, emphasizing illness and medication compliance
   throughout.^[133][13]

[[134]edit] Recognition

   Dr. Torrey has appeared on national radio and television (outlets like
   NPR, Oprah, 20/20, 60 Minutes, and Dateline) and has written for many
   newspapers. He has received a 1984 Special Families Award from NAMI,
   two Commendation Medals from the [135]U.S. Public Health Service, a
   1991 National Caring Award, and a humanitarian award from [136]NARSAD.
   In 1999, he received a research award from the International Congress
   of Schizophrenia. In 2005, a tribute to Torrey was included in NAMI's
   25th Anniversary Celebratory Donor Wall.^[137][15]

[[138]edit] Criticism

   Torrey has criticized many organizations. He has charged the
   [139]National Institute of Mental Health with not concentrating its
   resources sufficiently on severe mental illness and directly applicable
   research; NIMH has disputed his statistics and viewpoint.[140][17]

   Torrey has been charged with acting to limit the voice of those
   [141]consumers, survivors and ex-patients that he disagrees with,
   opposing their civil rights and censoring and ridiculing their ideas
   and those of their supporters. Torrey has been a long-time critic of
   the [142]Center for Mental Health Services that provides support and
   advocacy, on the grounds that they support [143]antipsychiatry groups
   and those opposed to [144]outpatient commitment, claiming they neglect
   the seriously mentally ill due to a hippie 60s attitude, distributing
   funds on the basis of other factors such as "community cohesion" and
   [145]ethnic minority involvement, and being more dysfunctional than the
   individuals it is supposed to help.[146][18] He has specifically
   opposed public funding for the [147]National Empowerment Center, for
   rejecting the [148]medical model and arguing for a [149]recovery model
   without necessarily needing medication; it has since lost its funding
   from the CMHS.[150][19] Torrey has in general been instrumental in
   lobbying against, and undermining, community-based consumer projects
   because they promoted social and experiential recovery and questioned
   the standard medical model. Consumer organizations have protested that
   they are already economically disadvantaged and vulnerable to political
   whim while Torrey and his organizations have rich and powerful
   backers.^[151][16] It has been argued that Torrey and other psychiatric
   and family member advocates do not necessarily have the same interests
   as consumers/survivors themselves. Differences in ideology sharpened
   after the development of [152]NAMI.^[153][17] In criticizing the
   [154]New freedom commission on mental health for not recommending
   forced outpatient medicating, Torrey claimed that stigma against people
   with mental disorders was largely due to them committing violent acts
   due to not taking medication, and called the [155]recovery model
   harmful for sending a cruel message of hope, or implicit blame, to
   those he believes cannot engage in a recovery process, despite being a
   laudable long-term vision for the Commission.^[156][18]^[157][16]
   Torrey hopes to live long enough to see [158]vaccines to prevent many
   or most cases of schizophrenia.^[159][5]

   Although Torrey described family members as "surviving schizophrenia"
   in his book of that title, in 1997 he said the term "psychiatric
   survivor" used by ex-patients to describe themselves was just political
   correctness and he blamed them, along with civil rights lawyers, for
   the deaths of half a million people due to suicides and deaths on the
   street.^[160][19] His comments elicited a record number of letters in
   response, some in favour of Torrey but most against.^[161][20] The
   accusations have been described as inflammatory and completely
   unsubstantiated, and issues of self-determination and self-identity
   said to be more complex than Torrey realizes.^[162][20] In the same
   journal in 1999, Torrey and Miller of the Stanley Foundation Research
   Progam argued for an incentivised schizophrenia treatment system backed
   by a credible threat of force, modelled on that used for the fatal
   infectious disease [163]Tuberculosis;^[164][21] replies criticized the
   logic of the analogy and resort to forced drugging rather than
   developing alliances and understanding, to which Torrey accused the
   director and members of [165]MindFreedom International of living off
   federal funds while denying illness and not caring about the mentally
   ill on the streets and in prisons.^[166][22] ^[167][23]

   Torrey has been a vocal critic of the failures of
   [168]deinstitutionalization and inadequate [169]community mental health
   services. He has generally linked this to issues of violence,
   homelessness and medication noncompliance, as well as lack of proper
   focus by the relevant governmental organizations.^[170][24] He has been
   accused of gaining influence by sensationalizing and exaggerating the
   incidence of violence and its link to medication noncompliance,
   including disseminating unsubstantiated and unreliable statistics. When
   a California NAMI journal editor included a questioning of Torrey's
   statistics, the local board glued together the pages[171][20] and
   effectively shut down the journal.^[172][16] Others, while agreeing
   that public mental health care in the U.S. falls far short of what
   people with serious psychiatric disorders need and deserve, have argued
   that Torrey's solutions are outdated and that his book The Insanity
   Offense is based on unsubtantiated portrayals of certainty on the
   statistics on violence, outpatient commitment and medication,
   stigmatizing tens of thousands of people, deeply offending and
   insulting those who hold views differing from his own, and promulgating
   one-dimensional solutions.[173][21] TAC's attempts to associate violent
   incidents in the news with lack of medication have been described as
   wild [174]hyperbole, and the use of the term "assisted treatment" has
   been described as a [175]euphemism for forced drugging.^[176][25]

   Torrey wrote "Homocides and Schizophrenia: In Out of the Shadows,
   published by John Wiley & Sons earlier this year, I estimated that
   there are now approximately 1000 homicides a year committed by
   individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, almost all of whom
   were not taking medication at the time of the homicide. My estimate was
   based on all cases in a metropolitan area of 4 million people for 1
   year, then extrapolated to the whole country. Anecdotal evidence
   suggests that such cases are not unique to urban areas so I think such
   extrapolation is reasonable. To date, nobody has challenged this
   1000/year estimate. Altogether in the US there are approximately 24,000
   homicides a year. Dr. E. Fuller Torrey"

   Philip Dawdy has challenged it. He wrote "You might even ask him why
   his group cites violence done by people not taking medications, but
   ignores violent acts committed by people who were on medications and
   why so many of the studies the group cites are decades old"

   and California Network of Mental Health Clients (CNMHC) has challenged
   it. "Contrary to Treatment Advocacy Center's explicit claims, the study
   makes no mention of "untreated" mental illness, schizophrenia,
   manic-depression, or any other diagnosis. Equally, there is no basis
   for extrapolating the 4.3% of the national population. TAC arbitrarily
   raised DOJ's homicide estimate from 4.3% to 5%. Then they arbitrarily
   attributed these homicides to less than 1% of the U.S. population, the
   number TAC says have "untreated schizophrenia and manic-depression."

   In another error: 4.3% of 16,914 (the total homicides in 1998) is 727,
   not 1,000 as TAC claims. And DOJ's predictions for 1999 will lower the
   figure still further to 645."

   Torrey has been criticized by, and has criticized, [177]Thomas Szasz, a
   [178]libertarian psychiatrist and author of [179]The Myth of Mental
   Illness who is opposed to involuntary treatment.^[180][26]^[181][27]
   Torrey has said he admires Szasz for his outspoken criticisms of many
   psychiatric practices, including "diagnostic creep" ([182]disease
   mongering) and the potential for the political abuse of psychiatric
   labels, but that when it comes to Szasz not seeing schizophrenia as a
   disease of the brain exactly like Parkinson's and Multiple Sclerosis
   then he is one of his most vocal critics.^[183][28]
