   At the core of the multi-billion dollar^[14][1] [15]Pokmon [16]media
   franchise of [17]various electronic games, [18]ongoing anime,
   [19]several manga series, [20]collectible trading card games, and other
   media are 493 distinctive fictional species classified as the titular
   Pokmon. Created by [21]Satoshi Tajiri, Pokmon is one of [22]Nintendo's
   flagship game franchises, which has sold over 143 million copies
   worldwide as of 2007^[23][update].^[24][2] These creatures and entities
   reside throughout various locations of the fictional Pokmon universe
   and can be caught by humans designated as [25]Pokmon Trainers often
   using devices called [26]Pok Balls. These trainers use Pokmon for a
   variety of purposes, such as being pets and loyal companions and/or
   being pitted against other trained Pokmon in competitive Pokmon
   battles. Pokmon are potentially powerful and magical creatures that can
   employ a variety of talents such as [27]generating fire or heat,
   [28]martial arts, [29]telekinesis, and so on. Through age and
   experience many of these species undergo a metamorphosis and transform
   into a similar but stronger specie in a process referred to as
   [30]Pokmon evolution.

   This is a selected listing of twenty of the Pokmon species, arranged as
   they are in the main game series' [31]National Pokdex.

[[54]edit] Latios

              Number: 381 Type: Dragon/Psychic Does not evolve

   Latios ( ,Ratiosu^[55]?) is the male Eon Pokmon. They are a blue and
   white, dragon-like, legendary Pokmon with small arms and feet, and
   spiky fighter aircraft-like wings on their back. They appear to have
   white flesh underneath their blue carapace. They appear extremely
   similar to [56]Latias, only blue, larger, and more angular. It is said
   that by folding their arms close to their body, they can fly faster
   than a [57]jet. Latios are all male.

   Latios' intelligence allows them to understand human languages. They
   have a docile temperament and dislike fighting. A Latios will only open
   his heart to a trainer with a compassionate spirit. Their signature
   attack, Luster Purge, may reduce the target's special defense. Like
   Latias, Latios can also render themselves invisible.

   Latios, along with Latias, have a starring role in the movie [58]Pokmon
   Heroes as guardians of Altomare, a city modeled after [59]Venice,
   Italy. At the end of the film, Latios sacrifices himself to protect
   Altomare from a tremendous [60]tsunami. It is notable that Latios marks
   the first actual Pokmon death in the anime series so far (the imaginary
   Entei and Celebi do not count).

   Latios appears in the non-Pokmon-exclusive game [61]Super Smash Bros.
   Brawl from [62]Pok Ball items.

[[63]edit] Kyogre

                   Number: 382 Type: Water Does not evolve

   Kyogre ( ,Kaiga^[64]?) is one of a trio of [65]legendary Pokmon,
   alongside Groudon and [66]Rayquaza. Kyogre represents [67]Pokmon
   Sapphire and appears on the cover art for the game. Kyogre represents
   the primal force of the oceans; as such, it has the power to bring
   forth storms, constant rain and massive floods. It is part of the
   creation myth of the Pokmon world. According to legend, a titanic
   battle between it and [68]Groudon created the oceans and the land, and
   the two were sealed beneath their respective elements. Despite being
   the creator of the oceans, Kyogre still came and helped Manaphy when it
   needed help as any other regular Pokmon would. Kyogre is similar to an
   [69]orca or [70]killer whale. It is a Water-type with the ability
   Drizzle, which makes the weather rainy until another weather move is
   used or a Pokmon with another weather altering ability is switched in.

   In [71]Pokmon Sapphire, Team Aqua tries to awaken and control Kyogre.
   It is awakened by a blue orb that the group actively seeks. They
   eventually awaken Kyogre, but they are stopped by the player in the
   video games. Kyogre made its first movie appearance in the ninth Pokmon
   movie, [72]Pokmon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea. In the movie,
   Kyogre helps [73]Ash, May, [74]Pikachu, and [75]Manaphy to protect the
   Sea Temple and defeat The Phantom.

   Kyogre is a Pok Ball Pokmon in the non-Pokmon-exclusive game [76]Super
   Smash Bros. Brawl. If the player releases Kyogre from a Pok Ball, the
   opponents are blasted with high amounts of water, pushing them off the
   screen. This water does not harm the opponent.If the opponent touches
   Kyogre, however, the opponent will receive damage.

[[77]edit] Groudon

                  Number: 383 Type: Ground Does not evolve

   Groudon ( ,Gurdon^[78]?) is one of a trio of [79]legendary Pokmon,
   alongside [80]Kyogre and [81]Rayquaza, that represents [82]Pokmon Ruby
   and appears on its [83]cover art. In the legend surrounding the three,
   Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the
   sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands
   and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans
   suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and
   evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with
   Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to
   erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability,
   which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a
   Pokmon with another weather-altering ability is switched in. At 2094
   lbs, Groudon is the heaviest of all known Pokmon. It stands at the same
   height as [84]Arbok (11 feet, 8 inches), but in the anime, it's
   depicted to be as tall as a skyscraper.

   Groudon first appears in [85]Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire and [86]Pokmon
   Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokmon Ruby focuses on [87]Team
   Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokmon Emerald
   has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The [88]anime follows a similar
   structure, where both Pokmon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team
   Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by [89]Ash Ketchum and [90]Lance,
   and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after
   calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokmon
   movie, [91]Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a
   Groudon is formed from the energy of [92]Jirachi.

   Groudon appears in [93]Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a Pokmon that can be
   released from a Pok Ball thrown by the player. In the game, any player
   (except the one who threw the Pok Ball containing it) that touches
   Groudon will burst into flames and take high amounts of damage.

[[94]edit] Rayquaza

               Number: 384 Type: Dragon/Flying Does not evolve

   Rayquaza ( ,Rekkza^[95]?) is one of a trio of [96]legendary Pokmon,
   alongside [97]Kyogre and [98]Groudon, that represents [99]Pokmon
   Emerald and appears on its [100]cover art. In the legend surrounding
   the three, Rayquaza represents the sky, while Kyogre and Groudon
   represent the sea and the land, respectively. Rayquaza resides within
   the [101]ozone layer of the Earth and has lived there for hundreds of
   millions of years without ever descending. To those who have observed
   Rayquaza from the surface of the planet, Rayquaza has always appeared
   to be a zooming [102]meteor. Rayquaza feeds on water and particles in
   the Earth's atmosphere. It is said to only descend from the ozone layer
   if Kyogre and Groudon were to fight, in order to end the feud and
   maintain the balance of nature.

   In Pokmon Emerald, Rayquaza is seen in a series of [103]cutscenes. Once
   the player progresses past the Magma and Aqua Hideouts, Kyogre and
   Groudon wake up and start fighting, with the Red and Blue Orbs unable
   to control them. It is eventually sought out at the Sky Pillar, and
   eventually forces the two to cease their battle. Rayquaza appears as a
   [104]boss character in the [105]Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue
   Team and Red Rescue Team, where the main team has to fight it in order
   to have it annihilate a falling star hurtling towards the planet.

   Rayquaza is featured in the seventh Pokmon movie, [106]Destiny Deoxys.
   Four years prior to the main events of the movie, Rayquaza is nearly
   injured in the ozone layer by the passage of a meteor containing the
   essence of [107]Deoxys. Rayquaza seemingly destroys the Deoxys
   afterwards, but it is eventually revived. Rayquaza goes after it again,
   but after being rescued by it, Rayquaza decides that it isn't an enemy,
   and returns to the atmosphere.

   Rayquaza appears in the story mode of [108]Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the
   Subspace Emissary, as a boss, in which it destroys [109]Fox's crashed
   Arwing and captures [110]Diddy Kong. It tries to attack Fox with Dragon
   Pulse, but Fox reflects the attack back at Rayquaza, knocking it into
   the lake and freeing Diddy. Rayquaza quickly recuperates and a boss
   battle ensures, ending with Fox and Diddy inevitably defeating it quite
   easily.

[[111]edit] Jirachi

               Number: 385 Type: Steel/Psychic Does not evolve

   Jirachi ( ,Jirchi^[112]?) a [113]legendary Pokmon that first appeared
   in the [114]Nintendo games [115]Pokmon Ruby and [116]Pokmon Sapphire.
   It possesses [117]telepathic and [118]telekinetic abilities, including
   the ability to levitate. Jirachi hibernates for periods of one thousand
   years in a crystalline cocoon. If it is ever in danger, it will fight
   its attacker, but not awaken from its slumber. After one thousand years
   have elapsed, Jirachi awakens from its sleep for one week if it is sung
   to in a pure voice. During this period, it is able to make wishes. If a
   message is inscribed onto one of the "tags" on Jirachi's head, it will
   fulfill those wishes. After it fulfills the wishes, Jirachi returns to
   hibernation in a newly-formed cocoon, waiting another thousand years
   for its next master's wish.

   Jirachi is one of the primary characters of the 6th Pokmon Movie,
   [119]Jirachi Wishmaker.^[120][3] [121]Tomiko Suzuki, in her final role,
   portrayed the character in the original Japanese version. Jirachi
   awakens for seven days, awaiting a wish to be granted. It soon
   befriends Max, and travels with him until it is used to create an evil
   being in the form of a [122]Groudon. It absorbs the power used to
   create the beast, and returns to sleep.

   Jirachi also appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, as a Poke'mon that can
   be released from a Poke'ball. It will drop random items on the stage
   before disappearing. After the fight ends, a screen will show up that
   says that you have seen Jirachi. It will then give you a trophy in the
   trophy room.

[[123]edit] Deoxys

                  Number: 386 Type: Psychic Does not evolve

   Deoxys ( ,Deokishisu^[124]?, pronounced /di'ks.s/) is a Pokmon formed
   from a mutation of a extraterrestrial virus exposed to a laser beam. It
   has psychokinetic powers and a high intelligence along with a
   crystalline organ on its chest that acts as its brain and shoots
   lasers. It has the ability to transform into four different forms, each
   with a specific purpose: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed. In the
   third generation of games, the form is based upon the game the Deoxys
   is contained within. As of [125]Pokmon Diamond and Pearl, it can freely
   change by interacting with the four meteorites in Veilstone City.

   Deoxys' name is based on "Deoxyribonucleic acid", or DNA, which is the
   base of all life and contains instructions for every part of it.

   Deoxys first appeared in the seventh Pokmon film, [126]Pokmon: Destiny
   Deoxys.^[127][4] In the film, it demonstrated the ability to switch
   between its forms, create shadow copies for use as drones, regenerate
   missing body parts, launch an [128]aurora into the sky, and erect a
   city-size force field which keeps nearly every sort of machine within
   from operating. The film also demonstrated that Deoxys is not a
   one-of-a-kind unique species like Rayquaza; more than one Deoxys is
   seen.

   In early 2005, [129]NASA began a cross-promotion with Nintendo and the
   Pokmon Company to provide an "[130]edutainment" program for children
   across the United States by Internet, teaching the science behind
   various Pokmon characters as they appear in Trading Card Game
   expansions.^[131][5] In the first segment of the program, based on the
   newly-released EX: Deoxys Trading Card Game expansion, they used the
   character of Deoxys to teach children about outer space, anatomy of a
   virus, the meaning of DNA, the existence of the ozone layer, and a
   definition of an extraterrestrial.^[132][6] Since then the program has
   had two other segments covering the next two expansions: EX
   Emerald^[133][7] and EX Unseen Forces.^[134][5]

   Deoxys also appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a Pok Ball Pokemon.
   It flys to the top of the screen and fires a thin, but highly dangerous
   beam downward, then vanishes quickly.

   In 2007, [135]Gamestop had an "event" for one three-day
   weekend(Friday,Saturday,and Sunday) where you could go into one of
   their stores and receive Deoxys using the Mystery Gift system.

[[136]edit] Turtwig

       Number: 387 Type: Grass Evolves from: None Evolves into: Grotle

   Turtwig, Naetoru ( ,Naetoru^[137]?) in original [138]Japanese language
   versions, are small, [139]turtle-like Pokmon, and are one of the three
   starter Pokmon for the Sinnoh region. Its prominent [140]jawbone may
   denote a relationship to the [141]snapping turtle. Its green and yellow
   body is covered by a shell. A small [142]seedling grows on its head,
   similar to the plant [143]bulb on [144]Bulbasaur's back and the leaf on
   [145]Chikorita's head.

   The soil-based shell on its back grows stronger when it absorbs water.
   Turtwig survives by carrying out [146]photosynthesis with its whole
   body. The leaf on its head will wilt if it becomes thirsty. As a
   result, it lives in areas that are close to lakes.

   Turtwig makes its first [147]Pokmon anime appearance in the first
   episode of the [148]Diamond and Pearl series, "Following a Maiden
   Voyage!", where it is shown as one of the three Sinnoh starter Pokmon
   in Professor Rowan's lab. Ash catches a wild Turtwig in the episode:
   "Gettin' Twiggy With It," and Turtwig also makes an appearance in "The
   Grass-Type is Always Greener!" as one of the Pokmon used by Eterna
   City's Gym Leader [149]Gardenia.

[[150]edit] Grotle

    Number: 388 Type: Grass Evolves from: Turtwig Evolves into: Torterra

   Grotle, Hayashigame ( ^[151]?) in original [152]Japanese language
   versions, is the evolution of [153]Turtwig. Grotle lives alongside
   water in forests. During the daytime, it leaves the forests to let the
   trees on its shell take in sunlight. Its shell is also strengthened by
   soil. Very slow and gentle, they only battle when needed, and in battle
   they will fight valiantly for the trainer.

   In the Pokmon anime, Ash's Turtwig evolved to Grotle, whose heavier
   size gave it a big disadvantage until Paul's Torterra taught it how to
   cope with its reduced speed.

[[154]edit] Torterra

   Number: 389 Type: Grass/Ground Evolves from: Grotle Evolves into: None

   Torterra, Dodaitos ( ,Dodaitosu^[155]?) in original [156]Japanese
   language versions, is the final evolution of the Turtwig evolutionary
   line. Despite their great size, these Pokmon are peaceful in nature and
   enjoy being with others of their own kind, preferring to bask in
   sunlight as they do not like to fight. When immobile, they look as if
   they are part of the ground upon which they rest, not as though they
   were a sleeping Pokmon. Because of this appearance, there are occasions
   when small Pokmon will gather and build nests on the shell of a
   stationary Torterra. When Torterra do move, they often move in herds in
   search of water. Paul's, (Ash's Sinnoh rival's), original starter
   Pokmon was a Turtwig that eventually evolved into a Torterra.

[[157]edit] Chimchar

      Number: 390 Type: Fire Evolves from: None Evolves into: Monferno

   Chimchar, Hikozaru ( ^[158]?) in original [159]Japanese language
   versions, is a small [160]chimpanzee-based [161]primate with orange
   fur. It is the Fire-type starter for the Sinnoh reigon. The flames on
   their rears are produced by burning gas in their stomachs. Chimchar
   also has a swirl-like symbol on the chest. The flames do not go out in
   the rain, and, unlike the tail flames of Charmander, those of Chimchar
   go out when they go to sleep.

   Chimchar makes its first [162]Pokmon anime appearance in the first
   episode of the [163]Diamond and Pearl series, "Following a Maiden
   Voyage!", where it is shown as one of the three Sinnoh starter Pokmon
   in Professor Rowan's lab. [164]Paul, one of the rivals of [165]Ash in
   the series, has a Chimchar he found in the wild. Paul later abandons
   Chimchar after a poor showing in a battle, and Ash asks it if it wants
   to join his team. Chimchar accepts.

[[166]edit] Monferno

    Number: 391 Type: Fire/ Fighting Evolves from: Chimchar Evolves into:
                                  Infernape

   Monferno, Moukazaru ( ^[167]?) in original [168]Japanese language
   versions, is the evolution of Chimchar. Its tail is similar to those of
   [169]Charmander due to the flames at the tips. This flame is often used
   as a weapon. When threatened, Monferno increases the size of its flame
   in order to appear larger than it really is, which is useful in scaring
   off attacking foes. It has white hair around its neck and gold [170]arm
   bands. Monferno can climb onto walls to shoot aerial attacks.

[[171]edit] Infernape

    Number: 392 Type: Fire/ Fighting Evolves from: Monferno Evolves into:
                                    None

   Infernape, Goukazaru ( ^[172]?) in original [173]Japanese language
   versions, is the final evolution of the Chimchar evolutionary line.
   Infernape uses a unique fighting style that utilizes all of its limbs.
   The flame on its head never goes out, even when it sleeps. It is most
   competitive when it comes to speed. It is one of the only Pokmon that
   can learn both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot.

[[174]edit] Piplup

      Number: 393 Type: Water Evolves from: None Evolves into: Prinlup

   Piplup, Pochama ( ,Potchama^[175]?) in original [176]Japanese language
   versions, is one of the three species of Pokmon players can choose from
   at the beginning of their adventure in the [177]Diamond and Pearl
   versions of the series. Characterized as [178]penguins, Piplup have a
   layer of fine [179]down covering their bodies that protects them from
   frigid waters as well as hot temperatures. Despite their cute
   appearance, Piplup are very proud Pokmon that dislike receiving food
   from others.^[180][8]

   A Piplup owned by a beginner Pokmon coordinator, [181]Dawn, has
   appeared in all of the [182]4th generation episodes, to date. Dawn
   befriended Piplup after saving it from a group of [183]Ariados, and
   chose it as her starter Pokmon. Piplup's next stages, "Prinplup" and
   "Empoleon" are even more proud, bringing up the words prince and
   emperor in parts of their names.

[[184]edit] Prinplup

     Number: 394 Type: Water Evolves from: Piplup Evolves into: Empoleon

   Prinplup, Pottaishi ( ^[185]?) in original [186]Japanese language
   versions, is the evolution of Piplup. Hunting in icy waters, Prinplup's
   most effective weapons are its flippers, which are strong enough to
   snap a tree in two. Prinplup live by themselves in their own "colony",
   as each considers itself to be the most important. In the anime,it is
   owned by Kenny, Dawn's rival.

[[187]edit] Empoleon

   Number: 395 Type: Water/Steel Evolves from: Prinplup Evolves into: None

   Empoleon, Emperte ( ,Emperuto^[188]?) in original [189]Japanese
   language versions, is the final evolution of the Piplup evolutionary
   line. The length of the three horns extending from the beak symbolize
   an Empoleon's strength; generally, the longer the horns are, the
   stronger the Pokmon is. Also, the biggest Empoleon's horns in a colony
   symbolizes the leader. An Empoleon can swim with a speed that can't be
   beaten by jet skis, and the tips of its wings are so sharp, they can
   destroy entire slabs of [190]drift ice.

[[191]edit] Starly

      Number: 396 Type: Normal/Flying Evolves from: None Evolves into:
                                  Staravia

   Starly, Mukkuru ( ^[192]?), in original [193]Japanese language
   versions, is a [194]Starling Pokmon that lives in noisy flocks with
   numerous members in each. It becomes less prominent when one is alone.
   The female's forehead coloring is smaller than that of the male. It,
   and its evolutions, resemble the three bird pokemon of Pokemon Blue,
   Red and Green, Pidgy, Pidgeotto, and Pidgeot.

   Both [195]Ash and [196]Paul catch Starly. Unlike Paul, Ash keeps his
   after catching it. Paul catches three of them, but releases two of
   them, and releases the last one at the end of the same episode. Ash's
   Starly evolves into Staravia during a battle with [197]Team Rocket.

[[198]edit] Staravia

     Number: 397 Type: Normal/Flying Evolves from: Starly Evolves into:
                                  Staraptor

   Staravia, Mukubird ( ,Mukubdo^[199]?) in original [200]Japanese
   language versions, live in enormous flocks like its pre-evolution,
   Starly. While in the flocks, it constantly searches fields and forests
   for bug Pokmon. Flocks often fight when confronted with each other.

   Staravia resembles a White-cheeked Starling. Its most prominent feature
   is the curled [201]crest on its head, similar to that of a
   [202]lapwing. It has a black and orange colored beak like a [203]quail.
   The name Staravia derives from the English words [204]starling and
   [205]avian. Staravia's Japanese name, Mukubird, is a [206]portmanteau
   of the [207]Japanese word for [208]White-cheeked Starling (
   ,mukudori^[209]?) and the English word bird.

   In the anime, Ash's Starly evolved into Staravia, and is frequently
   used in battles with Ash.

[[210]edit] Staraptor

    Number: 398 Type: Normal/Flying Evolves from: Staravia Evolves into:
                                    None

   Staraptor, Mukuhawk ( ,Mukuhku^[211]?) in original [212]Japanese
   language versions, is the final evolution of the Starly evolutionary
   line. It has a savage nature, where it consistently challenges larger
   Pokmon to battle. Its strong leg and wing muscles allow it to fly
   easily while gripping small Pokmon.

   In the anime, Paul's brother Reggie owns a Staraptor.

[[213]edit] Bidoof

      Number: 399 Type: Normal Evolves from: None Evolves into: Bibarel

   Bidoof, Bippa ( ^[214]?) in original [215]Japanese language versions,
   is a plump mouse Pokmon. It nests by the river, and constantly whittles
   its front teeth by gnawing on wood and rocks. It has nerves of steel,
   and is much more agile and active than it appears. Males have five
   lumps on their tails, unlike females, who have three.

[[216]edit] Bibarel

   Number: 400 Type: Normal/Water Evolves from: Bidoof Evolves into: None

   Bibarel, Beadull ( ,Bdaru^[217]?) in original [218]Japanese language
   versions, resembles a [219]beaver. It moves sluggishly out of water,
   but once it is submerged, it can swim faster than a [220]Feebas. It is
   an industrious worker that builds dams in streams with bark and mud.
   The male's light area on his face is shaped more like a bone. It is the
   only Pokmon that is both Water and Normal type(s).

   Bibarel first appeared in the anime in "Bibarel Gnaws Best" where it
   was helping to make a bridge complete. Paul's older brother Reggie also
   has one.
