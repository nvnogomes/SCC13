[[16]edit] Career

   Born [17]22 June [18]1934 in [19]Los Angeles, Jordans brief spell as an
   amateur shows that he began boxing as a [20]Middleweight and unusually
   worked his way down to [21]Welterweight as a professional. His amateur
   career spanned just fifteen contests, of which he lost only one.

   Jordan fought professionally for the first time in April, 1953.
   Standing 5 feet 9 inches and typically weighing around 147 lbs, Jordan
   was well-proportioned and quickly showed himself to be an effective
   performer, winning nine in a row before dropping a decision in March
   1954, to a fighter he had out-pointed just two months previously. He
   beat [22]Art Ramponi to pick up the [23]California State
   [24]Welterweight title in October of that year and opened his 1955
   campaign with a victory over former World [25]Lightweight Champion
   [26]Lauro Salas. From that point on, Jordan would be mixing it with the
   best.

   Jordans progress over the next three years including two notable
   victories over [27]Gaspar Ortega were rewarded when he challenged
   [28]Virgil Akins for the World [29]Welterweight Championship on 5
   December 1958, winning by unanimous decision. Akins who disputed the
   decision would suffer an identical reverse when he met Jordan in a
   championship return five months later. That was the first of Jordans
   two successful title defences (the second was against [30]Denny Moyer
   on [31]10 July [32]1959), before losing the title to [33]Benny Paret,
   eighteen months after being crowned.

   Once he lost his title, Jordan also seemed to lose his way. The last
   years of his career saw him record more defeats than victories and he
   was effectively if ignominiously retired by the man refereeing his
   October 1962 contest with [34]Battling Torres. When Jordan refused to
   get up after a knockdown in the Seventh, referee Jimmy Wilson ruled
   that Torres had not actually hit Jordan hard enough to put him down and
   the fight was declared a no contest. Subsequently, the [35]California
   State Athletic Commission suspended Jordan indefinitely.

[[39]edit] Passing

   After being robbed and seriously assaulted in a [40]Los Angeles parking
   lot in September 1996, Don Jordan went into a [41]coma, and died in a
   nursing home in [42]San Pedro, [43]California, on [44]13 February
   [45]1997.
