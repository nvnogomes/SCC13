Interaction (statistics)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Effect modification)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   A graphical depiction of a statistical interaction in which the extent
   to which experience impacts cost depends on decision time.

   In [9]statistics, an interaction is a term in a [10]statistical model
   added when the effect of two or more variables is not simply
   [11]additive. Such a term reflects that the effect of one variable
   depends on the values of one or more other variables.

   Thus, for a response Y and two variables x[1] and x[2] an additive
   model would be:

          Y = ax_1 + bx_2 + \mbox{error}\,\!

   In contrast to this,

          Y = ax_1 + bx_2 + c(x_1\times x_2) + \mbox{error},

   is an example of a model with an interaction between variables x[1] and
   x[2] ("error" refers to the [12]random variable whose value by which y
   differs from the [13]expected value of y).

   Very often the interacting variables are categorical variables rather
   than real numbers. For example, members of a population may be
   classified by religion and by occupation. If one wishes to predict a
   person's height based only on the person's religion and occupation, a
   simple additive model, i.e., a model without interaction, would add to
   an overall average height an adjustment for a particular religion and
   another for a particular occupation. A model with interaction, unlike
   an additive model, could add a further adjustment for the "interaction"
   between that religion and that occupation. This example may cause one
   to suspect that the word interaction is something of a misnomer.

   Statistically, the presence of an interaction between categorical
   variables is generally tested using a form of [14]Analysis of Variance
   (ANOVA). If one or more of the variables is continuous in nature,
   however, it would typically be tested using moderated multiple
   regression.^[15][1] This is so-called because a moderator is a variable
   that affects the strength of a relationship between two other
   variables.

   The consequence of an interaction is that the effect of one variable
   depends on the value of another. This has implications in [16]design of
   experiments as it is misleading to vary one factor at a time.

   Real-world examples of interaction include:
     * Interaction between adding sugar to coffee and stirring the coffee.
       Neither of the two individual variables has much effect on
       sweetness but a combination of the two does.
     * Interaction between adding [17]carbon to [18]steel and quenching.
       Neither of the two individually has much effect on [19]strength but
       a combination of the two has a dramatic effect.
     * Interaction between smoking and inhaling [20]asbestos fibres: Both
       raise lung carcinoma risk, but exposure to asbestos multiplies the
       cancer risk in smokers and non-smokers. Both risk factors were not
       shown to be additive  a clear indication of interaction.^[21][2]

   [22]Genichi Taguchi contended that interactions could be eliminated
   from a [23]system by appropriate choice of response variable and
   transformation. However [24]George Box and others have argued that this
   is not the case in general.
