From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]East Summit, Washington)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   This article is about the census-designated place in Kittitas County,
   Washington. For the mountain pass for which this CDP is named, see
   [9]Snoqualmie Pass. For other places named for the Snoqualmie tribe,
   see [10]Snoqualmie.

   Snoqualmie Pass is a [11]census-designated place (CDP) in [12]Kittitas
   County, [13]Washington, [14]United States. The population was 201 at
   the [15]2000 census.

   The CDP is named for the [16]mountain pass that carries [17]Interstate
   90 across the [18]Cascade Range, which itself is named for the
   [19]Snoqualmie tribe, a [20]Native American tribe indigenous to the
   [21]Snoqualmie Valley located west of the pass.

   Based on [22]per capita income, Snoqualmie Pass ranks 6th of 522 areas
   in the state of Washington to be ranked. It is also the highest rank
   achieved in Kittitas County.

[[28]edit] Recreation

   The area consists of mountain chalets that are mainly seasonally
   occupied by residents of the [29]Seattle metropolitan area, with
   approximately 150 year-round residents. Winter sports are the main
   draw, but outdoor recreation is available year round.

   The [30]Pacific Crest Trail crosses through Snoqualmie Pass and a
   variety of other trails are also available for [31]hiking and
   [32]climbing[33][1] in the summer, [34]cross-country skiing and
   [35]snowshoeing during the winter months.

   Snoqualmie Pass is also the site of the Summit at Snoqualmie, a group
   of [36]alpine ski areas managed by Boyne USA Resorts. The Summit
   consists of four [37]ski areas: [38]Alpental, Summit West (formerly
   named Snoqualmie Summit), Summit Central (formerly Ski Acres), and
   Summit East (formerly Hyak). The [39]Summit at Snoqualmie is the
   closest [40]ski area to Seattle, so it is often crowded on weekends.

   [41]Snowmobiling just east of the pass is also popular during the
   winter months. Also in the summer and [42]fall, [43]paragliders and
   [44]hang gliders may be seen flying above the valley, along the ridge
   and landing at [45]Lake Keechelus.
