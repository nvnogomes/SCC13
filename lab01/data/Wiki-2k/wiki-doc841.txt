   Eddie Betts (born Edward Roberts on 26 November 1986) is an
   [17]Australian rules footballer in the [18]Australian Football League.

   Betts grew up in [19]Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. In his early years
   Eddie was a very talented soccer player and at the age of 13 he was
   invited to join an [20]Adelaide City pathway program. However when his
   grandmother became very ill he and his mother had to return to
   Kalgoorlie. It was his father who eventually got him into footy after
   he returned from his two year jail stint. A little after this he moved
   to Melbourne to explore his footballing talent in a TAFE program for
   young indigenous players run by [21]Phil Krakouer.

   At the age of 16 he played in the Under 18 National Championships where
   he impressed so much he made All-Australian Under 18's as an under-age
   player. After such a promising start Eddie had returned home where he
   made some bad decisions and eventually became injured. At one stage he
   thought of even giving the game away after he didn't get drafted at
   all. He was then recruited as the number 3 draft pick in the [22]2004
   Pre-Season Draft. from [23]Templestowe. He made his AFL debut for the
   [24]Carlton Football Club in Round 1, 2005 against [25]North Melbourne.

   Betts made himself known as a lively small forward during the 2005
   Pre-Season. He solidified his position in the team by becoming a
   quality goal-sneak and chaser for the club. He was an immediate and
   lasting crowd favourite, with shouts of "Eddie!" always audible
   whenever he gets the football.

   In 2006, Betts kicked a goal from the boundary line in Round 21 against
   Collingwood in a goal that became the [26]AFL Goal of the Year. In an
   amazing effort, Betts smothered [27]Tarkyn Lockyer's attempted clearing
   kick, ran to gather it just before it went out of bounds, and steadied
   himself to score with a banana from an impossible angle.

   In 2007, Betts continued primarily as a small forward, but began to
   spend some rotations as a midfielder, particularly late in the season
   after the appointment of [28]Brett Ratten as Carlton coach. In Round 22
   2007, the last round of the season, Betts kicked 5 goals and racked up
   26 possessions, career highs in both statistics.

   In Round 2 of the 2008 season against St. Kilda, Betts kicked a
   magnificent left foot banana goal late in the last quarter to receive a
   goal of the year nomination. It was similar to his goal of the year in
   2006 but this time it was a left footer, which was nicely executed but
   under less pressure.

   Betts currently resides in [29]Dallas, Victoria.
