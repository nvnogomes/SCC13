[[80]edit] History

   An Eastern Air Lines [81]DC-3, on display in the [82]National Air and
   Space Museum in [83]Washington, D.C.

   Eastern Airlines began as a mail carrier for the [84]U.S. Postal
   Service in the mid-1920s, and is recognized as one of the first and
   longest-running U.S. "trunk" carriers. The airline grew into a
   passenger carrier soon after its inception and came to dominate much of
   the domestic travel industry along the lucrative east coast corridor by
   the 1950s. At the time it was widely known for its famous president,
   racer and [85]World War I Ace, [86]Eddie Rickenbacker.

   The airline did well financially well into the 1970s and was respected
   in the industry for helping to pioneer the use of a worldwide computer
   reservation system, an all-jet mainline fleet, and [87]yield management
   techniques. In the late 1960s, Eastern placed an order with the
   [88]Boeing Company for its brand new aircraft, the 747. To be delivered
   in the early 1970s, the airline ordered 4 [89]Boeing 747-125 aircraft.
   However, as the aircraft were nearly finished, Eastern cancelled the
   order. The jumbojets were converted to Boeing 747-131 designations and
   acquired by [90]TWA. Eastern was also a launch customer for the
   [91]Lockheed L1011 Tristar widebody jetliner in 1968. Although the
   airline cancelled their 747 order, they did lease a small number of
   747s from Pan Am while awaiting delayed Tristar aircraft. In 1983,
   Eastern was a launch customer for the [92]Boeing 757-200 type.

   By the 1970s the airline had grown into one of the "big 4" major U.S.
   airlines, and was led by astronaut-turned-CEO [93]Frank Borman.
   Initially very popular in the company and throughout the industry (even
   appearing in numerous Eastern advertising campaigns in the 1970s and
   1980s), Borman's popularity waned as the carrier struggled after the
   1978 [94]Airline Deregulation Act. As the carrier began to lose
   millions of dollars quarterly, Borman's relations with the unions began
   to suffer, and he eventually gave his blessing to a buyout proposal to
   shareholders from corporate raider [95]Frank Lorenzo's [96]Texas Air
   Corporation in 1985. By the end of 1986, Texas Air would control
   [97]New York Air, [98]People Express, Eastern Airlines, [99]Continental
   Airlines, and [100]Frontier Airlines (1950-1986).

   Despite its financial woes, Eastern had by this time become the largest
   airline in the free world in terms of passengers enplaned (a title it
   held for 3 years in the mid-1980s), served 26 countries on 3 continents
   (North America, Europe, and South America), and was petitioning the
   U.S. government for rights to operate in Asia. It also had large hub
   operations at airports in Atlanta, Miami, New York, Newark, Boston, San
   Juan, and Kansas City.

   Lorenzo and his [101]Texas Air Corporation presided over a dramatic and
   rapid decline of Eastern Airlines operations. Some industry analysts
   believe that Eastern was at that time in a difficult but redeemable
   situation. Although the exact causes of the decline are impossible to
   calculate precisely, and are disputed to this day, analysts agree that
   Eastern was, after a period of bad labor relations between Lorenzo and
   the Eastern unions, systematically raided of valuable assets. These
   included Eastern's newer aircraft, its Boston-New York-Washington
   shuttle service, its lucrative fuel operations, and its worldwide
   travel agent computer system (System One Direct Access). These assets
   were, in the main, sold at drastically reduced prices or transfered to
   Lorenzo's other mainline carrier, [102]Continental Airlines. These
   circumstances, combined with poor management practices, a worsening
   economy, and ever deteriorating labor relations forced the carrier into
   [103]Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1989 following a mechanics strike. At the
   time it was the largest airline bankruptcy in U.S. history, a title it
   held until United filed after the [104]9/11 terrorist attacks. The
   carrier was placed under the direction of trustee [105]Martin Shugrue.
   Eastern Airbus A300 at [106]St Maarten in 1986.

   Shugrue tried to rebuild the reduced route network, and an operation
   that had fallen badly behind the other domestic carriers with which EAL
   competed most directly ([107]American, [108]United, and [109]Delta).
   Although the carrier tried desperately to remake itself after the
   filing, it continued to bleed cash, finding itself billions in debt.
   With creditors clamoring for a shut-down, and the country entering
   recession and a war, Eastern ceased operations the day after the start
   of Operation [110]Desert Storm in 1991. Nearly 35,000 employees lost
   their jobs and some analysts agree that Eastern should have been
   allowed to continue operating by the bankruptcy court, considering its
   considerable assets and encouraging passenger loads. Eastern Airlines'
   proud 65-year history came to an inglorious end as its remaining assets
   were sold in a Court-approved liquidation sale in 1991.

   Many airlines rushed to fill the void left by Eastern's cessation of
   operations. American drastically expanded its operations in [111]Miami
   and, after purchasing [112]Braniff's [113]South America routes, to that
   continent. United and TWA also expanded into Eastern's historic
   territory, with TWA operating a short-lived hub in Atlanta. The Eastern
   terminals at both J.F.K. Airport in New York and Newark International
   Airport in New Jersey were demolished, and the Newark operations were
   supplanted by Continental, which also inherited the OnePass frequent
   flier program.

   As cited in an article in the Miami Herald - April 11, 2008, a former
   industry executive is interested in purchasing the airline back under
   the original Eastern name, intending a main hub being in MIA. This
   buyer group has expressed interest in beginning operations during the
   summer of 2009.

[[114]edit] Precursors

   Eastern Air Lines was a composite of assorted air travel corporations,
   including Florida Air Ways and Pitcairn Aviation, the latter of which
   was established on [115]April 19, [116]1926, by [117]Harold Frederick
   Pitcairn, son of [118]Pittsburgh Plate Glass founder [119]John
   Pitcairn, Jr.

[[120]edit] Transporting air mail

   In the late 1920s, Pitcairn Aviation won a government contract to fly
   mail between [121]New York City and [122]Atlanta, Georgia, using
   Mailwing single-engine aircraft. In 1929 Clement Keys, the owner of
   [123]North American Aviation, purchased Pitcairn. In 1930, Keys changed
   the company's name to Eastern Air Transport, soon to be known as
   Eastern Air Lines.

[[124]edit] Rickenbacker leadership

   In 1938, the airline was purchased by [125]World War I flying ace
   [126]Eddie Rickenbacker. Rickenbacker pushed Eastern into a period of
   prodigious growth and innovation. For a time, Eastern was the most
   profitable airline in the post-war era. In the late 1950s, Eastern's
   fortunes changed, and Rickenbacker was forced out of his CEO position
   on [127]October 1, [128]1959. His ouster was due largely to his
   reluctance to acquire jets. He felt they were a fad and that his fleet
   of turboprop Lockheed Electras [was] good enough. He left his position
   as chairman of the board on [129]December 31, [130]1963.

[[131]edit] Supporting World War II

   During the beginnings of World War II, military aviation equipment had
   not been produced. The United States war effort required civilian
   resources. Due to the efforts of Eddie Rickenbacker, Eastern Air Lines
   provided the United States with [132]aircraft and personnel.

[[133]edit] Developing air transportation systems

   Throughout the 1940s, competitors were acquired, more advanced planes
   were purchased and international routes were opened.

[[134]edit] Prominence in the industry

   By the 1950s, Eastern's propellers were very prominent up and down the
   [135]East Coast of the United States. In 1956, they purchased
   [136]Canadian airline [137]Colonial Airlines, which gave the airline
   their first service to Canada.^[138][1]

[[139]edit] Improving technology: jet aircraft

   In 1960 Eastern's first [140]jets, Douglas [141]DC-8s arrived, allowing
   Eastern to open non-stop service from [142]New York City's
   [143]Idlewild International Airport to Miami. The DC-8s were joined in
   1962 by the Boeing 720, then in 1964 by the [144]Boeing 727, which
   Eastern (and United) helped Boeing develop beginning in 1956. Eastern
   was the first airline to fly the 727 on February 3, 1964 (The 727
   became the fastest selling airliner in the world). Shortly after that
   "Captain Eddie" Rickenbacher retired and a new image was adopted, which
   included the now famous hockey stick design which is officially
   Caribbean Blue over Bahama Blue. Eastern was also the first US carrier
   to fly the A-300 and the first airline to fly the 757.

[[145]edit] Eastern Shuttle

   In 1961 Eastern inaugurated the Eastern Air Shuttle, featuring hourly
   flights of [146]Lockheed Constellations and [147]Electras between
   [148]New York-LaGuardia, [149]Washington, D.C.-National, and
   [150]Boston-Logan airports.

   The groundbreaking service emphasized convenience and
   simplicityrevolutionary in an era when air travel was both considered
   and expected to be a luxury. Not only were seat reservations not
   required, seat assignments were not given, and initially no check-in
   was required and no boarding passes were issued. Eastern guaranteed
   availability, however, and planes flew hourly whether empty or full. In
   the event of a full flight, Eastern simply added another aircraft. Jets
   were added in 1967 and the shuttle became all-jet in 1978 with a fleet
   of dedicated [151]Boeing 727s.

   The shuttle proved one of Eastern's most successful ventures. Other
   airlines, including [152]Pan American World Airways, eventually set up
   competing services.

   Eastern Air Shuttle's landing rights and some aircraft were bought by
   [153]Trump Airlines to run the [154]Trump Shuttle. [155]US Airways
   later bought the service from Trump Airlines, and respectively named it
   [156]US Airways Shuttle. Pan Am's shuttle service was bought by
   [157]Delta Air Lines to become the [158]Delta Shuttle, which directly
   competes with the US Airways Shuttle.

[[159]edit] New leadership, corporate changes

   Logo on an Eastern Air Lines [160]DC-3

   The 1970s brought dramatic changes in the management of Eastern. Former
   astronaut Frank Borman was brought on as president.

[[161]edit] Expanded routes and service

   Internationalization began as Eastern opened routes to new markets such
   as [162]Madrid, [163]Mexico City, [164]Santo Domingo, [165]Nassau,
   Bahamas and [166]London. Services from [167]San Juan, Puerto Rico's
   [168]Luis Muoz Marn International Airport were expanded.

[[169]edit] Larger equipment

   Eastern bought the [170]Lockheed L-1011 jet, which would become known
   in the [171]Caribbean as El Grandote (the huge one). [172]Boeing 747s,
   leased from Pan Am, would fly between Chicago and San Juan as well as
   New York to San Juan. Although they purchased 4, they were sold to TWA,
   before delivery. They were also introduced for a short time while the
   carrier awaited the delivery of the L-1011.

[[173]edit] Advertising campaign

   Just before [174]Walt Disney World opened in 1971, Eastern established
   service at Orlando and became the official airline of Walt Disney
   World. This proved to be extremely beneficial for Eastern as well as
   Disney. It remained the official airline of Walt Disney World, which
   even had an Eastern-themed ride at its park ([175]If You Had Wings in
   [176]Tomorrowland where Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin is currently
   located), until its contracting route network forced Disney to switch
   to Delta shortly before Eastern's 1989 bankruptcy filing. The ride was
   subsequently rethemed.

   The famous "Wings of Man" campaign, which began in the late 1960s, was
   created by advertising agency, Young & Rublicam, and restored Eastern's
   tarnished image until the late 1970s, when former astronaut Frank
   Borman became president and it was replaced by a new campaign, "We Have
   To Earn Our Wings Every Day". The new campaign, which featured Borman
   as a spokesperson, was used until the mid-to-late 1980s.

   Under bankruptcy Eastern launched a "100 Days" campaign, in which it
   promised to "become a little bit better every day".

[[177]edit] Deregulation and troubles at Eastern

   The [178]Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 aggravated its position,
   forcing Eastern into a competitive low-fare environment in which its
   high cost of operation put the airline at a decided disadvantage.

[[179]edit] Head to head with Delta

   Eastern's massive [180]Atlanta hub placed it in direct competition with
   [181]Delta Air Lines, where both carriers competed heavily with one
   another to neither's benefit. Delta's less-unionized work force and
   slowly expanding international route network helped lead it through the
   turbulent period following deregulation in 1978.

[[182]edit] Under Frank Borman

   When the 1980s started, Eastern operated under its new president,
   former [183]astronaut [184]Frank Borman.

[[185]edit] Expansion and growth

   In 1980, a Caribbean hub was inaugurated at [186]San Juan, Puerto Rico
   (then still named Isla Verde International Airport). In 1982, Eastern
   acquired [187]Braniff International Airways' [188]South American route
   network. In 1985 Eastern was the largest airline in the free world in
   terms of passengers enplaned and operated in 26 countries on three
   continents.

[[189]edit] Divided branding and livery

   During this era, Eastern's fleet was split between their
   "silver-colored hockey stick" livery (the lack of paint reduced weight
   by 100 pounds) and their "white-colored hockey stick" livery (on its
   [190]Airbus-manufactured planes, the metallurgy of which required paint
   to cover the aircraft's composite skin panels).

[[191]edit] The efficient Boeing 757

   In 1983, Eastern became the launch customer of [192]Boeing's new
   aircraft, the [193]Boeing 757, which was ordered in 1978. Borman felt
   that its low cost of operation would make it an invaluable asset to the
   airline in the years to come. However, higher oil prices failed to
   materialize and the debt created by this purchase coupled with the
   [194]Airbus A300 purchases made in 1977 proved to be a millstone around
   Eastern's neck, contributing to the February 1986 sale to Frank
   Lorenzo's [195]Texas Air. At that time, Eastern was paying over
   $700,000 in interest each day before they sold a ticket, fueled or
   boarded a single aircraft.

[[196]edit] Back to the 747

   In the 1980s, Eastern needed an aircraft for the Miami-London Route.
   They were to purchase two Boeing 747-238 aircraft from the Australian
   airline [197]Qantas. However, the airline was not allowed permission to
   fly the route and the deal fell through. The two aircraft, N371EA and
   N372EA, were already painted and were subsequently reinstated in the
   Qantas fleet.

[[198]edit] Subsidiary operations

   In that same year, Eastern reintroduced service to [199]Mayagez, Puerto
   Rico, using [200]de Havilland Twin-Otter (DHC-6) planes under the name
   [201]Eastern Metro Express. The Eastern Metro Express operation wasn't
   limited to Mayagez, however, as, under that name, Eastern Metro Express
   began service from its San Juan hub to [202]Borinquen and several other
   smaller Caribbean communities. Also, from [203]Atlanta Hartsfield
   Jackson Int'l Airport it served numerous feeder cities. Bar Harbor
   Airlines serving as Eastern Express spoked from Miami Int'l Airport to
   many cities around the southeast.

[[204]edit] Competition: quality versus price

   Eastern began losing money as it faced competition from no-frills
   airlines, such as [205]People Express, which offered drastically
   reduced air fares. In an attempt to differentiate itself from its
   bargain competitors, Eastern began a marketing campaign stressing its
   quality of service and its rank of highly experienced pilots.

[[206]edit] Sale and decline

   July 2, 1988, Eastern Air Lines employee timetable

   Unable to keep up, Borman agreed to the sale of the airline in 1986 to
   [207]Texas Air, led by [208]Frank Lorenzo. Lorenzo (who was named as
   one of Time Magazine's 10 "worst bosses of the century") was known as a
   ruthless corporate raider and union buster. He had already purchased
   Continental and lost a bidding war for TWA to [209]Carl Icahn.

   Although Eastern's employees saw Lorenzo at the time as a savior, he
   would prove to be anything but a hero to the employees by the end of
   the decade. This event is widely seen as the beginning of the unwinding
   of the company, and the beginning of a steep decline into a period that
   saw strikes, empty planes, mass layoffs, bankruptcy, and eventually a
   ceasing of operations.

[[210]edit] Labor relations: strikes and canceled service

   Under Lorenzo's tenure, Eastern was crippled by severe labor unrest.
   Asked to accept deep cuts in pay and benefits, Eastern's mechanics and
   ramp service employees, represented by the [211]IAM (International
   Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers), walked out on March 4,
   1989. A sympathy strike called by the pilots represented by [212]ALPA
   (Air Line Pilots Assn.) and flight attendants represented by [213]TWU
   (Transport Workers Union) effectively shut down the airline's domestic
   operations. Non-contract employees, including airport gate and ticket
   counter agents and reservation sales agents, did not honor the strike.
   Due to the strike, flights were canceled, resulting in the loss of
   millions of dollars in revenue.

[[214]edit] Dismantling the airline

   Lorenzo sold Eastern's shuttle service to real estate magnate
   [215]Donald Trump in 1989, under whom it became the [216]Trump Shuttle,
   while selling other parts of Eastern to his Texas Air holding company
   and its major subsidiary, [217]Continental Airlines, on disadvantageous
   terms to Eastern.

[[218]edit] Bankrupt

   As a result of the strike, weakened airline structure, inability to
   compete after deregulation and other financial problems, Eastern filed
   for [219]bankruptcy protection on [220]March 9, [221]1989. This gave
   Lorenzo breathing room, and allowed him to continue operating the
   airline with non-union employees. When control of the airline was taken
   away from Lorenzo by the courts and given to Marty Shugrue, it
   continued operations in an attempt to correct its cash flow, but to no
   avail. With the airline collapsing from debt, it ran out of money to
   operate on [222]January 18, [223]1991 following the run-up to the Gulf
   War. Over 18,000 employees lost their jobs and pensions in one day, not
   including the thousands laid off or furloughed prior to the collapse.

   An asset liquidation sale was commenced later that year and provided
   Eastern's creditors with a remarkably good payout.

[[224]edit] Attempts at revival

   An airline entrepreneur who was once the bankruptcy trustee of Eastern,
   [225]Martin Shugrue, considered reviving it in 1995, but the decision
   was made to revive [226]Pan Am instead.

[[260]edit] Fleet Curiosities

   With the implementation of the "Hockey Stick" livery in the 1960s, the
   Eastern Air Lines different aircraft types were given an a/c number,
   which was tied to the registration after a particular aircraft type,
   with the aircraft number placed close to the aircraft nose below the
   cockpit windows:

   Numbers Series / Aircraft Type / Registration example - e.g., N215EA
   was the a/c registration for ship 215.
     * 100 series: the 727-100: N8172G /172

   Ship # 128
     * 200 series: the Constellations, which passed to the A300 after the
       Connies were withdrawn from service: N6224C / 224 (cn 4532)
     * 200 series: the A300: N215EA / 215 (cn 108)
     * 300 series: the Convair 440, which passed on to the L-1011s after
       they were withdrawn from service: N9315 / 315 (cn 433)
     * 300 series: the L-1011: N324EA / 324 (cn 193A-1050), [N336EA was
       notorious for hydraulic problems].
     * 400 series: the DC-9-50: N404EA / 404 (cn 47665/796)
     * 500 series: the Lockheed L-188 Electra registration which was later
       given to the 757: N5541 / 541 (cn 1098)
     * 500 series: the 757-225: N506EA / 506 (cn 22196/7)
     * 600 series: the DC-8-21: N8615 / 615 (cn 45436/150)
     * 700 series: the DC-8-61/63: N8776 / 776 (cn 45888/290)
     * 700 series: also, the B720-025 carried the 700s: N8714E / 714 (cn
       18243/254)
     * 800 series: the DC-7 carried the registration in the 800s until
       they were removed from service, then it went to the 727-200: N827D
       / 827 (cn 45336/901)
     * 800 series: the B727-225: N805EA /805 (cn 22436/1677). Curiously,
       there were four B727-225s in an all coach configuration with 189
       coach seats each, they were mostly used in the Air Shuttle and
       carried registrations in the high 800s, namely: 886, 887, 888, and
       889.
     * 900 series: the DC-9-14 and DC-9-30: N8916E / 916 (cn 45733/48).
     * Since EA only operated a trio of DC-10-30s they carried a
       registration number in the 300s like the L-1011s but they were
       assigned high numbers: N390EA / 390 (cn 47862/88), N391EA / 391 (cn
       47866/149) and N392EA /392 (cn 47867/178)

[[261]edit] Accidents

   Eastern weathered crashes over the years of varying damage to the
   company and passenger injuries and deaths. Some of the crashes
   contributed to the future safety of American air transportation, such
   as Eastern's first accident caused by the construction of temporary
   utility poles at the end of a runway.

[[262]edit] Flight 21 (Rickenbacker's accident)

   In 1941, [263]Eastern Air Lines Flight 21 crashed near Atlanta, almost
   killing [264]Eddie Rickenbacker, who was traveling on airline business.
   His recovery in the hospital received broad press coverage; during his
   initial recovery several news reports claimed that he had died.

[[265]edit] Flight 375

   On [266]October 4, [267]1960, [268]Eastern Air Lines Flight 375 (a
   [269]Lockheed L-188 Electra) departing Boston's [270]Logan
   International Airport for [271]Philadelphia crashed on takeoff after
   [272]striking a flock of birds. Sixty-two of the 72 passengers and crew
   were killed.

[[273]edit] Flight 512

   On [274]November 30, [275]1962, [276]Eastern Air Lines Flight 512 (a
   [277]Douglas DC-7) crashed during a [278]go around after failing to
   land due to fog at [279]Idlewild Airport (now JFK) in [280]New York
   City. Out of the 51 passengers and crew on board, 25 were killed.

[[281]edit] Flight 304

   On [282]February 25, [283]1964, [284]Eastern Air Lines Flight 304 (a
   [285]Douglas DC-8) flying from New Orleans International Airport to
   [286]Washington-National Airport crashed into [287]Lake Pontchartrain
   enroute due to "degradation of aircraft stability characteristics in
   [288]turbulence, because of abnormal longitudinal trim component
   positions." All 51 passengers and 7 crew aboard were killed.

[[289]edit] Flight 663

   On [290]February 8, [291]1965, [292]Eastern Air Lines Flight 663, a
   Douglas DC-7 departing from [293]New York City to [294]Richmond,
   Virginia, crashed at [295]Jones Beach State Park after takeoff from
   [296]JFK when it was forced to evade inbound [297]Pan Am Flight 212.
   All 84 onboard died. The evasive action was blamed for leaving the
   plane out of control.

[[298]edit] Flight 401

   [299]Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 (a brand new [300]Lockheed L-1011)
   was preparing to land in [301]Miami, Florida, on [302]December 29,
   [303]1972, when the flight crew became distracted by a non-functioning
   gear light. After attempting to recycle the landing gear to no avail,
   the massive L-1011 went around. However, while so focused on this
   light, the captain accidentally disengaged the aircraft's autopilot by
   leaning on the yoke, putting the aircraft into a gradual unnoticed
   descent. The absence of the flight engineer under the captain's orders
   to verify if the front landing gear was in the locked position resulted
   in an unheard c chord altitude warning from the flight engineer's seat.
   This resulted in the aircraft descending to just less than 500 feet of
   altitude. When the flight crew finally realized they were too low, they
   could not spool the engines up fast enough to overcome an initiated and
   subsequent roll to the left to turn back to Miami, resulting in the
   left wing impacting the ground. The aircraft was destroyed. The flight
   crashed in the [304]Everglades, near the same site of the [305]ValuJet
   [306]Flight 592 [307]DC-9 crash 23 years later. In Eastern's Flight 401
   case, it was rumored that the ghost of the [308]pilot who flew that
   night was later seen on some Eastern planes that carried parts of the
   doomed plane. The legend became the subject of a book and the movie
   [309]The Ghost of Flight 401.

[[310]edit] Flight 212

   On the morning of [311]September 11, [312]1974, [313]Eastern Air Lines
   Flight 212, a [314]DC-9-31 carrying 78 passengers and 4 crew operating
   as a scheduled flight from [315]Charleston, South Carolina, to
   [316]Chicago, [317]Illinois, with an intermediate stop in
   [318]Charlotte, North Carolina, crashed while conducting an
   [319]instrument approach in dense ground fog at Douglas Municipal
   Airport (now called [320]Charlotte/Douglas International Airport). The
   aircraft crashed just short of the runway, killing 71 of the occupants.
   13 people survived the initial impact, but three subsequently died from
   their injuries. One of the initial survivors died of injuries 29 days
   after the accident. The aircraft was destroyed by the impact and
   resulting post-crash fire. Also killed on this flight were James,
   Peter, and Paul Colbert, the father and older brothers (respectively)
   of comedian [321]Stephen Colbert.^[322][2]

[[323]edit] Flight 66

   On [324]June 24, [325]1975, [326]Eastern Air Lines Flight 66 (a
   [327]Boeing 727) crashed into the runway approach lights, as it
   penetrated a thunderstorm which was astride the ILS localizer course
   line to that runway, at [328]JFK in New York City, killing 113 people.
   The official cause of the accident was a sudden high rate of descent,
   caused by severe downdrafts from the thunderstorm, and the continued
   use of that runway by both flight crews and ATC, after they became
   aware of the location of that hazardous weather. The aircraft hit a
   motorcyclist on impact, and ABA basketball star Wendell Ladner was one
   of the passengers killed in the crash. Most of the deceased were killed
   by fire after impact rather than the crash itself. The two flight
   attendants in the rear of the plane survived the fire because they were
   doused with the liquid contents of the rear lavatories, which kept them
   alive. The aircraft that landed on the same runway just prior to EAL
   Flight 66 was another Eastern aircraft, an L-1011, that managed to
   fight through the wind shear by having both pilots put their feet on
   the instrument panel and pulling back on the wheel with all of their
   strength. After landing, they radioed the tower to close that runway,
   but it was too late for EAL Flight 66.

[[329]edit] Flight 980

   On [330]January 1, [331]1985, [332]Eastern Air Lines Flight 980 (a
   [333]Boeing 727) struck Mount [334]Illimani on a flight from
   [335]Silvio Pettirossi International Airport in [336]Asuncin, Paraguay,
   to [337]El Alto International Airport in [338]La Paz, Bolivia. All 25
   passengers and 4 crew were killed on impact.

[[339]edit] Flight 677

   This flight was sent out of its original course for [340]Tampa on
   [341]January 28, [342]1986, when the [343]Space Shuttle Challenger was
   due to [344]launch that same day. As they were passing over Cape
   Canaveral, the plane was hit by strong winds.
