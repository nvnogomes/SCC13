   Port Royal, [10]Jamaica was the centre of [11]shipping [12]commerce in
   the [13]islands of the [14]Greater Antilles which make up the
   northeastern part of the outer ring of islands defining and enclosing
   the [15]Caribbean Sea. Its [16]indigenous [17]Arawakan-speaking
   [18]Tano inhabitants named the island Xaymaca, meaning the "Land of
   Wood and Water", or the "Land of Springs".^[19][1] Formerly a
   [20]Spanish possession known as Santiago, it for a while became the
   capital of the [21]British [22]West Indies [23]Crown colony of Jamaica
   and one home port of the [24]privateers employed to nip at superpower
   [25]Habsburg Spain's empire when smaller European powers dared not
   directly make war on Spain. As a port city it was notorious for its
   gaudy displays of wealth and loose morals, and was a popular place and
   base ([26]homeport) for the British and [27]Dutch sponsored
   [28]privateers to bring and spend their treasure during the 17th
   century. When those governments abandoned the practice of issuing
   letters of marque against the Spanish treasure fleets and possessions
   in the later 16th century, many privateers turned [29]pirate and used
   the city as their main base during the heyday of the Caribbean pirates
   in the 17th century. During the 16th century, the [30]English and
   French actively encouraged and even paid [31]buccaneers based at Port
   Royal to attack Spanish and [32]French shipping. Pirates from around
   the world congregated at Port Royal coming from waters as far away as
   [33]Madagascar on the far side of [34]Africa.

   In archaeology, Port Royal is the site of the only [35]earthquake which
   can be dated closely by not only date, but timewhich is documented by
   recovery from the sea floor in the 1960s of a pocket watch stopped at
   11:43 a.m. memorializing the preceding devastating earthquake shortly
   before^[36][2]^[37][3] on [38]June 7, [39]1692, largely destroying Port
   Royal, causing two thirds of the city to sink into the [40]Caribbean
   Sea such that today it is covered by a minimum of 25 ft (8 m) of water.
   Known today to 16th18th-century focused archaeologists as the "City
   that Sank"^[41][4], it is considered the most important underwater
   archaeological site in the [42]western hemisphere, yielding
   16th17th-century artifacts and many important treasures from indigenous
   peoples predating the 1588 founding, some from as far away as
   [43]Guatemala. Several 17th and early 18th century pirate ships sank
   within [44]Kingston Harbour and are being carefully harvested under
   controlled conditions by different teams of archaeologists. Other
   "digs" are staked out along various quarters and streets by different
   teams.

   After this disaster, its commercial role was taken over by the city of
   [45]Kingston. Current development in progress will redevelop the small
   fishing town into a tourist destination, serviced by cruise ships, with
   the archaeological findings at the heart of the attractions. These
   include a combination underwater museum-aquarium and restaurant with
   underwater [46]dioramas and viewing of the native tropical sealife.

[[53]edit] Colonization of Port Royal

   Situated at the western end of the [54]Palisadoes [55]sand spit that
   protects Kingston, Port Royal was well-positioned as a harbour.
   [56]England acquired it in 1655 though it was originally claimed by the
   Spanish,. By 1659, two hundred houses, shops, and warehouses surrounded
   the fort, and by 1692 five forts defended the port.^[57][5]

   For much of the period between the English conquest of Jamaica and the
   earthquake, Port Royal served as the capital of Jamaica; after the 1692
   earthquake, [58]Spanish Town overtook this role, later followed by
   Kingston, whose development was spurred through resettlement of
   quake-survivors^[59][5].

[[60]edit] Piracy in Port Royal

   Port Royal provided a [61]safe harbour initially for privateers and
   subsequently for [62]pirates plying the [63]shipping lanes to and from
   [64]Spain and [65]Panama. [66]Buccaneers found Port Royal appealing for
   several reasons. Its proximity to [67]trade routes allowed them easy
   access to prey, but the most important advantage was the port's
   proximity to several of the only safe passages or [68]straights giving
   access to the Spanish main from the Atlantic.^[69][5] The harbour was
   large enough to accommodate their ships and provided a place to
   [70]careen and repair these vessels. It was also ideally situated for
   launching raids on Spanish settlements. From Port Royal, [71]Henry
   Morgan attacked Panama, [72]Portobello, and [73]Maracaibo. [74]Roche
   Brasiliano, [75]John Davis (buccaneer), and [76]Edward Mansveldt
   (Mansfield) also came to Port Royal.
   An 18th-century [77]pirate flag ([78]Calico Jack Rackham).

   Since the English lacked sufficient troops to prevent either the
   Spanish or French from seizing it, the [79]Jamaican governors
   eventually turned to the pirates to defend the city.

   By the 1660s, the city had gained a reputation as the [80]Sodom of the
   New World where most residents were pirates, cutthroats, or
   [81]prostitutes. When [82]Charles Leslie wrote his history of Jamaica,
   he included a description of the pirates of Port Royal:

          Wine and women drained their wealth to such a degree that some
          of them became reduced to beggary. They have been known to spend
          2 or 3,000 [83]pieces of eight in one night; and one gave a
          [84]strumpet 500 to see her naked. They used to buy a [85]pipe
          of wine, place it in the street, and oblige everyone that passed
          to drink.

   Port Royal grew to be one of the two largest towns and the most
   economically important port in the [86]English colonies. At the height
   of its popularity, the city had one [87]drinking house for every ten
   residents. In July 1661 alone, forty new licenses were granted to
   [88]taverns. During a twenty-year period that ended in 1692, nearly
   6,500 people lived in Port Royal. In addition to prostitutes and
   buccaneers, there were four [89]goldsmiths, forty-four tavern keepers,
   and a variety of [90]artisans and [91]merchants who lived in 200
   buildings crammed into 51 acres (206,000 m) of real estate. 213 ships
   visited the seaport in 1688. The citys wealth was so great that coins
   were preferred for payment rather than the more common system of
   [92]bartering goods for services.

   Following [93]Henry Morgans appointment as lieutenant governor, Port
   Royal began to change. Pirates were no longer needed to defend the
   city. The selling of [94]slaves took on greater importance. Upstanding
   citizens disliked the reputation the city had acquired. In 1687,
   Jamaica passed anti-piracy laws. Instead of being a safe haven for
   pirates, Port Royal became noted as their place of [95]execution.
   [96]Gallows Point welcomed many to their death, including [97]Charles
   Vane and [98]Calico Jack, who were hanged in 1720. Two years later,
   forty-one pirates met their death in one month.^[99][6]

[[100]edit] Earthquake of 1692 and its aftermath

   On [101]June 7, [102]1692, a devastating earthquake hit the city
   causing the sand on which it was built to [103]liquefy and flow out
   into Kingston Harbour. The water table was generally only two feet down
   before the impact. The effects of three [104]tidal waves caused by the
   earthquake further eroded the sand, and soon the main part of the city
   lay permanently underwater, though intact enough that archaeologists
   have managed to uncover some well-preserved sites. The earthquake and
   tsunami killed between 1,000 and 3,000 people combined, over half the
   city's population. Disease ran rampant in the next several months,
   claiming an estimated 2,000 additional lives. Many believed the
   destruction from the earthquake to be an [105]act of God resulting from
   the city's sinful reputation.

   Some attempts were made to rebuild the city, starting with the one
   third of the city that was not submerged, but these met with mixed
   success and numerous disasters. An initial attempt at rebuilding was
   again destroyed in 1703 by fire. Subsequent rebuilding was hampered by
   several [106]hurricanes in the first half of the 18th century, and soon
   Kingston eclipsed Port Royal in importance.

   Although it's a piece of historical fiction, James Michener's "The
   Caribbean" details the history, atmosphere and geography of Port Royal
   accurately.

[[107]edit] Recent history

   A final devastating earthquake on [108]January 14, [109]1907 again
   liquefied the sand spit, destroying nearly all of the rebuilt city and
   submerging additional portions.

   Today the area is a shadow of its former self with a population of less
   than 2,000 and has little to no commercial or political importance.
   This is in part a result of abandonment of plans begun in the early
   1960s to develop the town as a cruise ship port and destination; the
   plans for which stimulated the archaeological explorations on the site,
   which in turn led to suspension of the development.^[110][5]

   In 1998, the Port Royal Development Company commissioned
   [111]architectural firm [112]The Jerde Partnership to create a master
   plan for the redevelopment of Port Royal, which was completed in
   2000.^[113][7] The focus of the plan is a 17th century-themed
   attraction that reflects the city's heritage. It has two anchor areas:
   Old Port Royal and the Kings Royal Naval Dockyard. Old Port Royal
   features a cruise ship pier extending from a reconstructed Chocolata
   Hole harbour and Fisher's Row, a group of cafes and shops on the
   waterfront. The Kings Royal Naval Dockyard has a [114]shipbuilding
   museum and the headquarters for the [115]Admiral of the [116]Royal
   Navy. The plan also includes a [117]five-star hotel.^[118][8]

   Port Royal has been featured as a location within [119]Disney's
   [120]Pirates of the Caribbean film series, though much of the location
   work for Port Royal was actually done on the island of [121]Saint
   Vincent, not in Jamaica.^[122][9]
