Earth's field NMR

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]EFNMR)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   [9]Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in the [10]geomagnetic field is
   conventionally referred to as Earth's field NMR (EFNMR). Note that the
   same acronym is used for [11]electric field NMR.

   EFNMR is a special case of [12]low field NMR.

   When placed in a constant magnetic field and stimulated (perturbed) by
   a pulsed or alternating magnetic field, NMR active nuclei (such as ^1H
   or ^13C) resonate at frequencies characteristic of the [13]isotope. The
   resonant frequencies and signal strengths are proportional to the
   strength of the applied magnetic field. Thus in the 21 [14]tesla
   magnetic field that may be found in high resolution laboratory [15]NMR
   spectrometers, protons resonate at 900 MHz. However in the Earth's
   magnetic field the same nuclei resonate at audio frequencies of around
   2 kHz, generating very weak signals.

   The location of a nucleus within a complex molecule affects the
   chemical environment experienced by the nucleus. Thus different
   [16]hydrocarbon molecules containing NMR active nuclei in different
   positions within the molecule produce slightly different patterns of
   resonant frequencies. Analysis of the frequency spectrum allows the
   structure of the molecule to be determined.

[[23]edit] Applications

   Applications of EFNMR include:
     * [24]Proton precession magnetometers (PPM) or [25]proton
       magnetometers, which produce magnetic resonance in a known sample
       in the magnetic field to be measured, measure the sample's resonant
       frequency, then calculate and display the field strength.

     * EFNMR spectrometers, which use the principle of [26]NMR
       spectroscopy to analyse molecular structures in a variety of
       applications, from investigating the structure of ice crystals in
       polar ice-fields, to rocks and hydrocarbons in the field.

     * Earth's field MRI scanners, which use the principle of [27]magnetic
       resonance imaging.

   The advantages of the Earth's field instruments over conventional (high
   field strength) instruments include the portability of the equipment
   giving the ability to analyse substances on site, and their lower cost.
   The much lower geomagnetic field strength, that would otherwise result
   in poor signal-to-noise ratios, is compensated by homogeneity of the
   Earth's field giving the ability to use much larger samples. Their
   relatively low cost and simplicity make them good educational tools.

   Examples (illustrated) are the [28]TeachSpin and [29]Terranova MRI
   instruments.

[[30]edit] Mode of operation

   [31]Free Induction Decay (FID) is the magnetic resonance due to
   [32]Larmor precession that results from the stimulation of nuclei by
   means of either a pulsed dc magnetic field or a pulsed resonant
   frequency (rf) magnetic field, somewhat analogous respectively to the
   effects of plucking or bowing a stringed instrument. Whereas a pulsed
   rf field is usual in conventional (high field) NMR spectrometers, the
   pulsed dc field method of stimulating FID is usual in EFNMR
   spectrometers and PPMs.

   Since the FID resonant frequency of NMR active nuclei is directly
   proportional to the magnetic field affecting those nuclei, we can use
   widely available NMR spectroscopy data to analyse suitable substances
   in the [33]Earth's magnetic field.

   For more context and an explanation of NMR principles, please refer to
   the main articles on [34]NMR and [35]NMR spectroscopy.

[[36]edit] Proton EFNMR frequencies

   The geomagnetic field strength and hence precession frequency varies
   with location and time.

          Larmor precession frequency = [37]magnetogyric ratio x magnetic
          field
          Proton magnetogyric ratio = 42.576 Hz/T (also written
          42.576 MHz/T or 0.042576 Hz/nT)
          Earth's magnetic field: 30 T near Equator to 60 T near Poles,
          around 50 T at mid-latitudes.

   Thus [38]proton (hydrogen nucleus) EFNMR frequencies are [39]audio
   frequencies of about 1.3 kHz near the Equator to 2.5 kHz near the
   Poles, around 2 kHz being typical of mid-latitudes.

   Examples of molecules containing hydrogen nuclei useful in proton EFNMR
   are [40]water, [41]hydrocarbons such as [42]natural gas and
   [43]petroleum, and [44]carbohydrates.

[[45]edit] History

   Early EFNMR instruments were developed in the 1950s using
   [46]thermionic valve ([47]vacuum tube) circuits. Sir [48]Peter
   Mansfield's first acquaintance with NMR was an undergraduate project to
   develop a [49]transistorized EFNMR spectrometer in the late 1950's
   [50][1]. Following that introduction to NMR, he went on to invent an
   [51]MRI scanner, for which he shared a Nobel prize.
