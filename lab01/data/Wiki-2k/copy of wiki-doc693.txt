Earl de Grey

   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   The titles of Marquess Grey and Earl de Grey were created in the
   peerages of [9]Great Britain and the [10]United Kingdom respectively
   for descendants of the Greys, Earls of Kent, who were unrelated to the
   family of the [11]Earls Grey.

   Henry Grey, 12th [12]Earl, 1st [13]Marquess and 1st [14]Duke of Kent
   was created Marquess Grey in 1740. As this title had a special
   remainder, it did not become extinct on his death later that year,
   along with his other titles, but passed to his granddaughter [15]Jemima
   (ne Campbell), Countess of [16]Hardwicke, who was the daughter of Lady
   Amabel Grey by her husband the [17]3rd Earl of Breadalbane. The title
   became extinct on her death in 1797.

   The 2nd Marchioness de Grey's daughter [18]Amabel, suo jure
   [19]Baroness Lucas, was created Countess de Grey in 1816. On her death
   without issue, the title passed to her sister's son [20]Thomas, 3rd
   Baron Grantham, who became 2nd Earl de Grey and adopted the name of "de
   Grey". He died in 1859, when the Earldom passed to his nephew
   [21]George, 2nd Earl of Ripon (son of the Prime Minister [22]Lord
   Goderich). The 2nd Earl of Ripon and 3rd Earl de Grey was created
   [23]Marquess of Ripon in 1871, and was succeeded in 1909 by his son
   [24]Frederick, who became 4th Earl de Grey, 3rd Earl of Ripon, 2nd
   Marquess of Ripon, 3rd Viscount Goderich, and 5th Baron Grantham. All
   the titles became extinct on his death in 1923.
