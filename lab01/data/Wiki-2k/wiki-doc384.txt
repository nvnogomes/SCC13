   A literary technique or literary device is an identifiable [12]rule of
   thumb, [13]convention or [14]structure that is employed in
   [15]literature and [16]storytelling.

   Literary techniques are important aspects of an author's [17]style,
   which is one of the five [18]elements of fiction, along with
   [19]character, [20]plot, [21]setting and [22]theme.

   Literary devices refer to specific aspects of literature, in the sense
   of its universal function as an art form which expresses ideas through
   language, which we can recognize, identify, interpret and/or analyze.
   Literary devices collectively comprise the art forms components; the
   means by which authors create meaning through language, and by which
   readers gain understanding of and appreciation for their works. They
   also provide a conceptual framework for comparing individual literary
   works to others, both within and across genres. Both literary elements
   and literary techniques can rightly be called literary devices.

[[27]edit] Annotated list of literary techniques

     * [28]Alien space bats, a [29]plot device sometimes used in
       [30]alternate history to create a [31]point of divergence that
       would otherwise be implausible.
     * [32]Anthropomorphism, a form of [33]personification, taking
       human-like characteristics to both living and non-living objects.
     * [34]Author surrogate, a character who acts as the author's
       spokesman. Sometimes the character may intentionally or
       unintentionally be an idealized version of the author. A well known
       variation is the [35]Mary Sue or [36]Gary Stu (self-insertion).
     * [37]Back-story, the story "behind" or "before" the events being
       portrayed in the story being told; past events or background for a
       character that can serve to color or add additional meaning to
       current circumstances. Provides extra depth to the story by
       anchoring it to external events, real or imagined.
     * [38]Breaking the fourth wall, when the author or a character
       addresses the audience directly (also known as [39]direct address).
       This may acknowledge to the reader or audience that what is being
       presented is [40]fiction, or may seek to extend the world of the
       story to provide the illusion that they are included in it.
     * [41]Chekhov's gun, the insertion of an object of apparent
       irrelevance early on in a narrative, the purpose of which is only
       revealed later on in the story. See also [42]foreshadowing and
       [43]repetitive designation.
     * [44]Conceit, an [45]extended metaphor associated with
       [46]metaphysical poetry, designed to push the limits of the
       imagination in order to portray something indescribable.
     * [47]Defamiliarization, technique of forcing the reader to recognize
       common things in an unfamiliar or strange way, in order to enhance
       perception of the familiar.
     * [48]Deleted affair, telling of a romantic relationship, but not
       referred to in the current story.
     * [49]Deus ex machina (a machination, or act of god), a [50]plot
       device dating back to [51]ancient Greek theater, where the primary
       conflict is resolved through a means that seems unrelated to the
       story (i.e. a God comes down out of nowhere and solves everything,
       saving the character from peril). In modern times, the Deus ex
       machina is often considered a clumsy method, to be avoided in order
       not to frustrate readers or viewers.
     * [52]Dramatic visualization, "the representing of an object or
       character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic
       rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given
       scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience". This
       technique dates back to the [53]Arabian Nights.^[54][1]
     * [55]Epic Theater, a technique popularized by 20th century
       playwright [56]Bertolt Brecht, in which the audience is "alienated"
       or "distanced" from the emotion of the play.
     * [57]Epiphany, a literary work or section of a literary work
       presenting, usually symbolically, such a moment of revelation and
       insight.
     * [58]Epistolary novel, a novel in the form of a series of documents,
       usually letters or e-mails exchanged between the characters.
       Classic examples include [59]Pamela by [60]Samuel Richardson
       (1740), [61]The Expedition of Humphry Clinker by [62]Tobias
       Smollett (1771), [63]Les Liaisons dangereuses by [64]Pierre
       Choderlos de Laclos (1782) and [65]Dracula by [66]Bram Stoker
       (1897).
     * [67]False documents, fiction written in the form of, or about,
       apparently real, but actually fake documents. Examples include
       Robert Graves's [68]I, Claudius, a fictional [69]autobiography of
       the Roman emperor, H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon, and the
       [70]Flashman series by [71]George MacDonald Fraser. The short
       stories of [72]Jorge Luis Borges are often written as summaries or
       criticisms of books that in actuall do not exist.
     * [73]Fictional fictional character, a character whose fictional
       existence is introduced within a larger work of fiction, or a
       character in a [74]story within a story. Early examples include
       [75]Panchatantra and [76]Arabian Nights. See also [77]frame story.
     * [78]Finger Posting, where casual details are inserted so that a
       revelation will not seem disconnected from the story.
     * [79]Flashback (or analeptic reference), general term for altering
       time sequences, taking characters back to the beginning of the
       tale, for instance.
     * A [80]Flashforward, also called [81]prolepsis, is an interjected
       scene that takes the narrative forward in time from the current
       point of the story. Flashforwards are often used to represent
       events expected, projected, or imagined to occur in the future.
       They may also reveal significant parts of the story that has not
       yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. This can be seen in
       the television series Lost.
     * [82]Foreshadowing, hinting at events to occur later. Giving an idea
       to what's going to happen in the upcoming events. See also
       [83]formal patterning, [84]repetitive designation and [85]Chekhov's
       gun.
     * [86]Formal patterning, "the organization of the events, actions and
       gestures which constitute a narrative and give shape to a story;
       when done well, formal patterning allows the audience the pleasure
       of discerning and anticipating the structure of the plot as it
       unfolds". This technique dates back to the [87]Arabian
       Nights,^[88][1] and is also used in [89]Romeo and Juliet. See also
       [90]foreshadowing.
     * [91]Frame story, or a [92]story within a story, where a main story
       is used to organize a series of shorter stories. Early examples
       include [93]Panchatantra, [94]Arabian Nights and [95]The Decameron.
       A more modern example is [96]Brian Jacques [97]The Legend of Luke.
     * [98]Framing device, the usage of a single action, scene, event,
       setting, or any element of significance at the beginning and end of
       a work.
     * [99]Incluing, gradually exposing the reader to background
       information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to
       clue the readers into the world the author is building, without
       them being aware of it such as [100]Brave New World. Opposite of
       [101]Infodumping.
     * [102]Infodumping, (Also, plot dump) where a concentrated amount of
       background material is given all at once in the story, often in the
       form of a conversation between two characters, both of whom should
       already know the material under discussion. (The so-called "[103]As
       you know, Bob" conversation.) Opposite of [104]Incluing.
     * [105]In medias res, when the story begins in the middle of an
       intense action sequence.
     * [106]Irony, a discrepancy between expectation and reality. The
       three forms of irony are: situational irony, where a situation
       features a discrepancy between what is expected and what is
       actualized; dramatic irony, where a character is unaware of pivotal
       knowledge which has already been revealed to the audience (the
       discrepancy here lies in the two levels of awareness between the
       character and the audience); and verbal irony, where one states one
       thing while meaning another. Verbal irony is the lowest form of
       irony. The difference between verbal irony and sarcasm is
       exquisitely subtle and oft contested, but exists nonetheless. The
       concept of irony is too often misunderstood in popular usage.
       Unfortunate circumstances and coincidences do not constitute irony
       (nor do they qualify as being tragic). See the Usage controversy
       section under [107]irony, and the term [108]tragedy.
     * [109]Juxtaposition, when the author places two themes, characters,
       phrases, words, or situations together for the purpose of
       comparison, contrast, or rhetoric.
     * [110]Lampshade hanging, a technique used in many forms of fiction
       to deflect attention from implausible or just plain bad writing by
       having a character point out how strange or unlikely it is. Once
       acknowledged in-character, the audience accepts it.
     * [111]Leitwortstil, the 'the purposeful repetition of words' in a
       given literary piece that "usually expresses a motif or [112]theme
       important to the given story". This dates back to the [113]Arabian
       Nights.^[114][1]
     * [115]Magic realism, a form particularly popular in [116]Latin
       America but not limited to that region, in which events are
       described realistically, but in a magical haze of strange local
       customs and beliefs. [117]Gabriel Garca Mrquez is a notable author
       in the style.
     * [118]Narrative hook, opening of a story that "hooks" the reader's
       attention so he or she will keep reading
     * [119]Narrative letter
     * [120]Overstatement, exaggeration of something, often for the
       purpose of emphasis (also known as a [121]hyperbole).
     * [122]Onomatopoeia, a word that sounds the same as, or similar to
       what the word means.
     * [123]Oxymoron, when two opposite terms are used together .
     * [124]Parody, ridicule by imitation, usually humorous, such as
       [125]MAD Magazine.
     * [126]Pastiche, using forms and styles of another author, generally
       as an affectionate tribute, such as the many stories featuring
       [127]Sherlock Holmes not written by [128]Arthur Conan Doyle, or
       much of the [129]Cthulhu Mythos.
     * [130]Pathetic fallacy, the reflection of the mood of a character
       (usually the protagonist) in the atmosphere or inanimate objects. A
       good example is the storm in [131]William Shakespeare's [132]King
       Lear, which mirrors Lear's mental deterioration.
     * [133]Pathos, or emotional appeal, one of the three [134]modes of
       persuasion in [135]rhetoric used by the author to inspire pity or
       sorrow in the reader towards a character; pathos typically does not
       counterbalance the suffering of the target character with a
       positive outcome, as in Tragedy.
     * [136]Personification, the use of comparative metaphors and similes
       to give living characteristics to non-living objects.
     * [137]Plot twist, a change ("twist") in the direction or expected
       outcome of the plot of a film or novel.
     * [138]Poetic justice, when virtue is ultimately rewarded or vice
       punished, often in modern literature by an ironic twist of fate
       intimately related to the character's own conduct.
     * [139]Predestination paradox, a paradox of time travel when a time
       traveler is caught in a loop of events that "predestines" him or
       her to travel back in time.
     * [140]Quibble, one of many [141]plot devices, is an argument that
       the intended meaning of an agreement holds no legal value, as only
       the exact verbally specified conditions are those which were agreed
       upon.
     * [142]Repetitive designation, "repeated references to some character
       or object which appears insignificant when first mentioned but
       which reappears later to intrude suddenly in the narrative", a
       technique which dates back to the [143]Arabian Nights.^[144][2] See
       also [145]foreshadowing and [146]Chekhov's gun.
     * [147]Self-fulfilling prophecy, a prediction that, in being made,
       actually causes itself to become true. Early examples include the
       legend of [148]Oedipus, and the story of [149]Krishna in the
       [150]Mahabharata. There is also an example of this in [151]Harry
       Potter.
     * [152]Sensory detail or [153]Imagery, sight, sound, taste, touch,
       smell.
     * [154]Side story, a form of narrative that occurs alongside
       established stories set within a fictional universe. Examples
       include [155]Mahabharata, [156]Ramayana, [157]Gundam, [158]Doctor
       Who and [159]The Matrix.
     * [160]Story within a story, where a story is told within another
       story. An early famous example of this is the [161]Arabian Nights.
       See also [162]frame story.
     * [163]Stream of consciousness, a special form of [164]interior
       monologue characterized by leaps in syntax and punctuation that
       traces a character's fragmentary thoughts and sensory feelings.
     * [165]Symbolism, the applied use of symbols: iconic representations
       that carry particular conventional meanings.
     * [166]Thematic patterning, "the distribution of recurrent thematic
       concepts and moralistic [167]motifs among the various incidents and
       frames of a story. In a skillfully crafted tale, thematic
       patterning may be arranged so as to emphasize the unifying argument
       or salient idea which disparate events and disparate frames have in
       common". This technique dates back to the [168]Arabian
       Nights.^[169][1]
     * [170]Ticking Clock, the threat of impending disaster. Often used in
       thrillers where salvation and escape are essential elements.
     * [171]Tone, the overall attitude that an author appears to hold
       toward the worka novel such as [172]Candide makes fun of the
       sufferings of its characters, while [173]The Sorrows of Young
       Werther takes its protagonist's suffering very seriously.
     * [174]Unreliable narrator, a technique in which the narrator of the
       story is not sincere or introduces a bias in the way he tells it
       and possibly misleads the reader, hiding or minimizing some events,
       characters or motivations.
     * [175]Word play, when the nature of the words used becomes an aspect
       of the work.
     * [176]Writer's voice, a combination of the various structural
       aspects of an author's writing style.

   Note: In the context of a play literary devices are referred to as
   [177]dramatic devices which are used to add interest and tension.

     * [180]Allegory
     * [181]Rhetoric
     * [182]Rhetorical devices

   See also [184]figure of speech (such as [185]alliteration, [186]simile,
   [187]metaphor, [188]metonymy), that is a use of words or phrases that
   departs from straightforward, literal language. Figures of speech are
   often used and crafted for emphasis, freshness of expression, or
   clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use. Many poems,
   short stories, and novels use figures of speech.
