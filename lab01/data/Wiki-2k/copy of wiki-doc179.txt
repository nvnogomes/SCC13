   Donald Bradley Duncan (1896-1975) was an [14]admiral in the [15]United
   States Navy, who played an important role in [16]aircraft-carrier

   commanding officer of the carrier [27]Essex (CV-9).

   Duncan held several important staff and operational positions following
   the war. He served as [28]Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air) from
   [29]6 March [30]1947 to [31]20 January [32]1948. He commanded the
   [33]2nd Task Fleet after 1948, and was the [34]Vice Chief of Naval
   Operations from 1951 to 1956.

   Following his retirement from the navy on March 1, 1957, he served as
   Governor of the [35]Naval Home until May 1962. He died on September 8,
   1975.
