   Unsourced material may be [13]challenged and removed. (January 2009)

   [14]Electronic Gaming Monthly [15]magazine was famous for its [16]April
   Fools' Day jokes. The jokes usually contained a reference to a hidden
   feature in a popular [17]video game that could only be accessed through
   an obscure and often nearly impossible method.

   The joke was usually placed in an inconspicuous place in the magazine,
   and was normally treated as if it was a genuine piece of news that was
   being written about. Through careful observation, however, readers
   could pick out several signs that the story may be a joke:
     * The use of the number 41 (4/1 - April 1st).
     * A letter written by a reader from the state HA (HA is often used as
       [18]onomatopoeia for laughter. There is no state with the postal
       code of HA - Hawaii is HI).
     * A phonetic or hidden spelling of the phrase "April Fools'" or
       "Fooled Again."

   Often, those duped by EGM's prank would write letters to other
   magazines or game companies to figure out a strategy for unlocking game
   features. For example, [19]Nintendo Power ran a brief article to
   dispose of rumors of [20]Sonic and [21]Tails as [22]hidden characters
   in [23]Super Smash Bros. Melee. Other times, readers will be tricked
   into being skeptical of a story that is, in fact, true, while the real
   April Fools' prank goes unnoticed. For example, readers overlooked a
   typo on the cover of the magazine as a joke, instead focusing on the
   inclusion of a Hadouken special move in [24]Mega Man X, which was
   legitimately hidden in the game. Capcom would later add a Dragon Punch
   special move in [25]Mega Man X2, incidentally.

   Some of EGM's jokes have, coincidentally, become real features in
   games. [26]Sheng Long, the fictional master of [27]Street Fighter
   characters [28]Ken and [29]Ryu, is often viewed as the inspiration for
   the introduction of [30]Akuma into the series. Also, some cheats, such
   as a "nude cheat" for [31]Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, have
   been made a reality, through the use of [32]cheat devices such as the
   [33]GameShark or via hacked versions of the game. Joke [34]crossovers
   thought to be ludicrous at the time have also occasionally come true in
   later sequels, as with [35]Battletoads & Double Dragon and Sonic's
   appearance in [36]Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Additionally, while Apple
   has not created their own portable game console called the iGame, games
   have made their way to the [37]iPod Touch and [38]iPhone, which are
   purchased and downloaded through iTunes.

   An EGM Live* [39]podcast, released in March [40]2007, explored the
   history of the April Fools' prank. The podcast can be downloaded for
   free at the [41]1UP.com website [42][1] (that podcast, itself, has an
   April Fools joke^[[43]citation needed]. The joke was revealed on the
   podcast a week later^[[44]citation needed]).

[[63]edit] 1991

   Enter a code to play as [64]Simon Belmont in [65]Teenage Mutant Ninja
   Turtles II: The Arcade Game. The method of getting the code to work was
   just out of the realm of possibility (the title screen would disappear
   a second before readers were able to finish the code), frustrating
   people who believed the code to be legitimate. The giveaway that it was
   a prank could be seen in the name of the person who submitted the code:
   "A.P. Rilphulls", who was listed as being from "Fromegm, HA" (April
   Fools from EGM, ha).
     * In the letters section of the following issue, EGM "promised" never
       to pull a similar joke again... while showing a picture of the
       [66]Battletoads in the NES version of [67]Double Dragon. Years
       later, [68]Rare would make [69]Battletoads & Double Dragon. EGM
       also ran a photo of [70]Sonic the Hedgehog running down a hill in
       the Genesis version of the game [71]Strider during this time period
       to further tease readers.

[[72]edit] 1992

   Original Sheng Long article.

   Perhaps the most infamous of all the April Fools jokes was the
   [73]Sheng Long trick for [74]Street Fighter II. It was said that if one
   could get through Street Fighter II's grueling 11-character roster
   without taking a hit, and then get 9 "draws" in a row vs. final boss
   [75]M. Bison, the player could supposedly fight against a special
   character called Sheng Long, who was said to be [76]Ryu's master.

   An ad suggesting gamers look for the April Fool's joke in the issue of
   EGM was placed on the same page as the Sheng Long trick. Despite this,
   most readers didn't catch on to the gag.

   The name W.A. Stokins ("waste tokens") from Fuldigen, HA ("Fooled
   again, ha!") also appears on the page as a runner-up.

   Ironically, several of Sheng Long's attributes (the Flaming Dragon
   Punch, air throws, red fireballs, high-powered spin kick) are actual
   moves that were added to Ken and Ryu's repertoire in later games. This
   joke is often credited with inspiring the creation of [77]Akuma,
   although [78]Capcom has never officially confirmed this. Capcom has in
   fact created a Sheng Long figure, as a token of goodwill and fun.

   In the January 2008 issue of [79]Electronic Gaming Monthly, [80]Street
   Fighter IV producer Yoshinori Ono mentioned the possibility of adding
   [81]Gouken, Ryu and Ken's sensei in Street Fighter [82]canon, to the
   character roster, citing EGM's previous April Fools pranks as a source
   of inspiration.

[[83]edit] 1993

   In the month's "New Releases" section, after the listings of games for
   all the currently released systems, there was a listing for 4 games for
   the not-yet-released Atari Jaguar game system. Titles included Joust
   2000 and Dig Dug 2000 from companies like [84]"Vapor Ware."

[[85]edit] 1994

   The cover of EGM had what was claimed to be an intentional typo:
   "Streeets of Rage 3." The reality of the situation, however, was that
   everyone on the magazine's staff had forgotten that they were working
   on the April issue, and no actual joke was created. After the issue had
   been produced, the staff realized its oversight, causing them to
   scramble to find an excuse for forgetting their tradition. "Luckily"
   there happened to be a typo on the issue's cover, which was quickly
   adopted as the April Fool's joke.^[86][1] EGM finally admitted to this
   fake April Fools' joke ten years later on page 57 of the May 2004 issue
   of EGM (issue #178).

   At the time, no one writing in guessed this correctly this to be the
   joke. However, many readers wrote in guessing, incorrectly, that a code
   for [87]Mega Man X, giving [88]X a Street Fighter-style [89]Hadouken,
   was fake.

[[90]edit] 1995

   In the coming attractions section of the April 1995 issue, a Sonic the
   Hedgehog game (a character created by Sega exclusive to their console
   at the time) was listed as being published by "Nintendo". Donald Kenney
   from North Tonawanda, NY wrote into EGM finding the error which turned
   out to be intentional as 1995's EGM April Fools Joke.[cn]

[[91]edit] 1997

   A repeat of the Sheng Long joke, updated for [92]Street Fighter III.

[[93]edit] 1998

   "All Bonds" cheat in [94]GoldenEye 007. The cheat was said to be able
   to unlock three of the actors who played James Bond ([95]Sean Connery,
   [96]Roger Moore and [97]Timothy Dalton) as playable multiplayer
   characters.

   The joke stems from a rumored statement that Rare made where one could
   play as those Bonds but couldn't get licenses to get their likenesses.
   However, their faces are still in the game's code. This feature later
   turned out to be true, but one required a [98]GameShark to unlock it.

[[99]edit] 1999

   They did a brief review of a gaming accessory called "GameShortz" in
   their article where they reviewed various gaming accessories. The
   GameShortz appeared to be just a pair of [100]boxer shorts with
   [101]PlayStation controllers attached to them. The review didn't
   explain what the GameShortz did and seemed to be more poking fun at the
   idea of them. A big clue that it was an April Fools' joke was the price
   tag of $41.99 (4/1/99 or April 1, 1999).

[[102]edit] 2000

   EGM printed a multi-page feature (complete with doctored conference
   pictures) that the [103]Intellivision was going to make a comeback. The
   absurdity of the idea as well as the tongue-in-cheek article indicated
   this was a joke. Oddly enough, there was another article in the
   magazine about [104]Conker's Bad Fur Day taking a new direction into
   bathroom and profane humor; which could have been mistaken by some as
   the hoax.

[[105]edit] 2001

   A small article in the April magazine advertised that Sega found a
   warehouse full of [106]Sega Neptunes and were selling them off. There
   was a website listed where one could order a Neptune for $399.99.
   However, after one added it to their cart they were immediately
   directed to another web site that read "APRIL FOOLS!" and had a counter
   at the bottom of the screen showing how many people "fell" for it.

[[107]edit] 2002

   [108]Super Smash Bros. Melee's "Unlock [109]Sonic and [110]Tails" code,
   where players had to defeat 20 opponents in Cruel Melee mode. This
   prank went widely believed for months, to a point where rival magazine
   [111]Nintendo Power had to create a blurb to try and explain the origin
   of the rumor while not indirectly promoting EGM by mentioning the
   magazine's name. After revealing the prank, EGM held a contest where
   those who sent in videos of their Cruel Melee battles with over 20 KOs
   would win a copy of [112]Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. In an interesting
   twist to the joke, the [113]sequel to Melee, [114]Super Smash Bros.
   Brawl, features Sonic as a playable character.

[[115]edit] 2003

   A 'nude cheat' for [116]Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball. The
   cheat required players to complete the game a scant few seconds faster
   than is physically possible. The 'cheat' caused quite a commotion, and
   was even sold over the internet by some people through the bidding
   website [117]eBay.

   Ultimately, hackers were, indeed, able to create a "patch" for the game
   that allowed for "nude" bathing suits to be worn by game characters,
   but the patch could only be applied to unauthorized copied versions of
   the game.

[[118]edit] 2004

   Competing kart racers would be released for the [119]PSP - one based on
   the books and one based on the movies - featuring characters from
   [120]The Lord of the Rings. There was a small clue in the fake
   game-screen, it showed the lap times that the total time would add up
   to 4/1/04, subliminally saying April Fools Day.

[[121]edit] 2005

   EGM told readers that starting on April 1st, if they preordered
   [122]The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (at that time it was not
   known as Twilight Princess therefore they simply used a generic title)
   they would receive a copy of [123]The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
   with updated "realistic" graphics equal to those of the new game. A
   screenshot of the newly reworked Dragon Roost Island dungeon was
   provided as evidence.

[[124]edit] 2006

   States that [125]Apple Computer is making a portable gaming device
   called the iGame. The iGame would have been compatible with
   [126]iTunes, Apple's music download store. Closer examination of one of
   the images revealed that the first letter in each game's title on the
   list spelled out EGMS APRIL FOOLS.

   Coincidentally, current generation models of Apple's [127]iPod device
   allow for the downloading and playing of small games through iTunes.

[[128]edit] 2007

   An exclusive first look for what appeared to be a spin-off in the
   [129]Kingdom Hearts series, that was to be released in 2008. It was an
   exclusive [130]Wii game named "[131]Mushroom Kingdom Hearts", featuring
   over 41 ( 4 as in April, 1 as in 1st) Nintendo characters and
   characters from the first two games in the series. The article was
   complete with artwork of a re-designed [132]Mario holding a golden
   [133]keyblade. Sora and King Mickey are pictured with him. Accompanying
   this picture was an image of a Mushroom with the Kingdom Hearts crown
   symbol on its head. EGM has confirmed in their [134]March 26, [135]2007
   podcast that the article was in fact the year's April Fool's joke,
   commenting on how the Mario design was a photoshopped image of the
   Super Mario Sunshine artwork. Interestingly, on Friday, [136]November
   23, 2007, RPG Magazines issue number 5 wrote, Square-Enix is
   considering bringing back Super Mario RPG by making a sequel on the
   [137]DS. The sequel would include more characters from the Final
   Fantasy universe.^[138][2]

[[139]edit] 2008

   Claimed to have an exclusive look into a new title developed by
   [140]Bungie Studios called "[141]Lego [142]Halo," which would play
   similarly to the current crop of Lego and other intellectual property
   mash-up video game titles, such as [143]Lego Star Wars, [144]Lego
   Batman, and [145]Lego Indiana Jones, with a touch of the first person
   shooter genre. It played on Bungie's statement that their next title
   would be "something completely different." Continuing the 41 theme from
   previous years, EGM said a character named Burt-041 would be featured
   in a bonus mission.^[146][3]In response to the 2008 joke the Official
   Xbox Magazine did an article in their March issue about a kid who does
   real Halo scenes from the game with Lego. The title of the article on
   the cover is "Lego Halo:The Real Deal".
