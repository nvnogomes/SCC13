[[47]edit] Overview

   While ABC and ESPN have aired college football games on Saturday nights
   for decades, this program marks the first time that a collegiate
   sporting program has officially been part of any major over-the-air
   network's primetime schedule.

   Twelve weeks of games were televised during the 2006 college football
   season during the three-month period, with the [48]Dr Pepper [49]2006
   Big 12 Championship Game closing out the season on December 2, 2006.
   Twelve weeks of games were televised for the 2007 season again with the
   [50]2007 Big 12 Championship Game ending the season on December 1,
   2007. With the college football season longer by a week, thirteen weeks
   of games were televised for the 2008, closing with the [51]2008 Big 12
   Championship Game on December 6, 2008.

   Saturday Night Football games essentially replace noon games, which
   aired sporadically on the West Coast because affiliates were airing
   [52]E/I-compliant children's programming to meet FCC licensing
   guidelines. A few noon games still air on ABC, however. Typically these
   games occur when the Saturday Night Football game is pre-empted or the
   occasional tripleheader that ABC airs.

   Saturday Night Football uses a variation of ABC's decades-old college
   football theme music (this variation originated from ABC broadcasts of
   bowl games starting in 1998), while all other college football
   broadcasts on ABC and ESPN use the ESPN college football theme music.
   Also, as a nod to the past, the program uses [53]chroma key technology
   to display a shot of the stadium crowd behind the announcers during the
   opening portion of the game; such practices were prevalent during
   [54]ABC Sports broadcasts during the 1970s and 1980s.
