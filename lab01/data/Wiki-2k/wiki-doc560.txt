Dvals

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Dvaletia)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   The Dvals were an old [9]people in the [10]Caucasus, their lands lying
   on both sides of the central [11]Greater Caucasus mountains, somewhere
   between the [12]Darial and [13]Mamison gorges. This historic territory
   mostly covers todays [14]South Ossetia, a breakaway region of
   [15]Georgia and part of [16]North Ossetia-Alania, [17]Russian
   Federation, as well as some neighboring lands in Georgias historic
   regions of [18]Racha and [19]Khevi.

   The name of the Dvals ([20]Georgian: , Dvalni) comes from the old
   Georgian annals, their land called Dvaletia (. Dvalet`i) after them.
   Although the real ethnic identity of the Dvals remains obscure, they
   are hypothesized to have spoken a language related to the [21]Nakh
   group. The Dvals are sometimes tentatively linked to the Talae, Valae
   or Ualae of [22]Pliny the Elder and [23]Ptolemy who placed them in
   [24]Sarmatia Asiatica. [25]Christianity began to spread among the Dvals
   in the mid-6th century, under Georgian influence. They were regarded as
   vassals of the Georgian crown and paid a tribute, while the Georgian
   kings fortified their fortresses and mountain passes securing the
   strategic Dvaletian road. When the [26]Mongols destroyed, in the
   13th-14th centuries, the Alanian kingdom in the [27]Northern Caucasus,
   the Ossetians migrated towards and over the Caucasus mountains, forming
   in part of Dvaletia their community called Tuallg. The Dvals (known to
   the Ossetians as Tualta) were pushed sothward and, as a result, the
   process of their [28]assimilation within the Georgians and Ossetians
   accelerated and was completed by the early 18th century. The term
   Dvaleti(a), retaining only a geographic meaning, then narrowed to refer
   solely to the area around the Kudaro valley in the west (modern-day
   [29]Java district). Their [30]ethnonym may have survived as the surname
   Dvali, occasionally encountered in Georgia.

   The most prominent Dvals were, perhaps, the 11th-13th [31]calligraphers
   John, Michael, Stephen, and George who worked at various [32]Georgian
   Orthodox monasteries abroad, chiefly in [33]Jerusalem and at the
   [34]Mount Athos, and created several fine examples of old Georgian
   manuscripts, e.g. The Months and The Vitae of [35]St Basil (John the
   Dval, circa 1055), and the so-called Labechini [36]Gospels (George the
   Dval, 13th century).

   The Orthodox church venerates also the memory of St Nicholas of
   Dvaletia, a Dval or Ossetian monk from the Georgian monastery at
   Jerusalem, who was martyred, on [37]October 19, [38]1314, at the order
   of [39]Amir Denghiz for having preached Christianity [40][1].
