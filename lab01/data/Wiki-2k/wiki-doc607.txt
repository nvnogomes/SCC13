   The [37]chemical compound potassium chloride (KCl) is a [38]metal
   [39]halide [40]salt composed of [41]potassium and [42]chlorine. In its
   pure state it is [43]odorless. It has a white or [44]colorless
   [45]vitreous [46]crystal, with a [47]crystal structure that cleaves
   easily in three directions. Potassium chloride crystals are
   face-centered cubic. Potassium chloride is occasionally known as
   "[48]muriate of potash," particularly when used as a fertilizer.
   [49]Potash varies in color from pink or red to white depending on the
   [50]mining and recovery process used. [51]White potash, sometimes
   referred to as soluble potash, is usually higher in analysis and is
   used primarily for making [52]liquid starter fertilizers. KCl is used
   in [53]medicine, scientific applications, [54]food processing and in
   judicial [55]execution through [56]lethal injection. It occurs
   naturally as the [57]mineral [58]sylvite and in combination with
   [59]sodium chloride as [60]sylvinite.

[[68]edit] Chemical properties

   Potassium chloride can react as a source of [69]chloride [70]ion. As
   with any other [71]soluble ionic chloride, it will precipitate
   insoluble chloride [72]salts when added to a [73]solution of an
   appropriate metal ion:

          KCl([74]aq) + [75]AgNO[3](aq) [76]AgCl([77]s) + KNO[3](aq)

   Although potassium is more [78]electropositive than [79]sodium, KCl can
   be reduced to the metal by reaction with metallic sodium at 850 C
   because the potassium is removed by distillation (see [80]Le
   Chatelier's principle):

          KCl(l) + Na(l) NaCl(l) + K(g)

   This method is the main method for producing metallic potassium.
   [81]Electrolysis (used for sodium) fails because of the high solubility
   of potassium in molten KCl.

   As with other compounds containing potassium, KCl in powdered form
   gives a lilac [82]flame test result.

[[83]edit] Production

   Potassium chloride occurs naturally as [84]sylvite, and it can be
   extracted from [85]sylvinite. It is also extracted from [86]salt water
   and can be manufactured by crystallization from [87]solution,
   [88]flotation or [89]electrostatic separation from suitable minerals.
   It is a by-product of the making of [90]nitric acid from [91]potassium
   nitrate and [92]hydrochloric acid.

[[93]edit] Uses

   The majority of the potassium chloride produced is used for making
   [94]fertilizer, since the growth of many [95]plants is limited by their
   potassium intake. As a chemical [96]feedstock it is used for the
   [97]manufacture of [98]potassium hydroxide and potassium metal. It is
   also used in medicine, [99]scientific applications, food processing,
   and as a sodium-free substitute for [100]table salt (sodium chloride).

   Potassium chloride is also used as the third of a three drug
   combination in [101]lethal injection. Additionally, KCl is used to
   terminate the life of the unborn fetus in induced abortion procedures
   by lethal injection to the heart, which induces cardiac
   arrest.^[102][2]

   It is sometimes used in [103]water as a completion fluid in
   [104]petroleum and [105]natural gas operations, as well as being an
   alternative to sodium chloride in household [106]water softener units.
   KCl is useful as a [107]beta radiation source for calibration of
   [108]radiation monitoring equipment because natural potassium contains
   0.0118% of the [109]isotope ^40K. One [110]kilogram of KCl yields 16350
   [111]becquerels of [112]radiation consisting of 89.28% beta and 10.72%
   [113]gamma with 1.46083 MeV. Potassium chloride makes up 70% of
   [114]Ace Hardware's [115]pet and vegetation-friendly "Ice Melt" though
   inferior in melting quality to calcium chloride (0 [116]F v. 25 F). It
   is also used in various brands of bottled water, as well as in bulk
   quantities for [117]fossil fuel [118]drilling purposes.

   Potassium chloride was once used as a fire extinguishing agent, used in
   portable and wheeled fire extinguishers. Known as Super-K dry chemical,
   it was more effective than sodium bicarbonate-based dry chemicals and
   was compatible with protein foam. This agent fell out of favor with the
   introduction of potassium bicarbonate (Purple-K) dry chemical in the
   late 60s, which was much less corrosive and more effective. Rated for B
   and C fires.

   Potassium chloride is also an optical crystal with a wide transmission
   range from 210 nm to 20 m. It was often used in the infrared spectrum
   range and it is still used some time.

   KCl crystal is hygroscopic and cheap. This limits its application to
   protected environment or for short term uses (prototyping). Exposed to
   free air KCl optics will "rot".
   Today other crystals much more tough like [119]ZnSe has overcome KCl
   (for the IR spectral range).

   Optical data:
   Transmission range: 210 nm to 20 m
   [120]Transmittivity = 92% @ 450 nm and rises linearly to 94% @ 16 m
   Refractive Index = 1.456 @ 10 m
   Reflection Loss = 6.8% @ 10 m (two surfaces)
   dN/dT (expansion coefficient)= 33.210^6/C
   dL/dT (refractive index gradient)= 4010^6/C
   Coefficient of absorption: 0.001 cm^1
   Thermal conductivity = 0.036 W/(cmK):
   Damage threshold (Newman & Novak): 4 GW/cm^2 or 2 J/cm^2 (0.5 or 1 ns
   pulse rate)
   Damage threshold (Kovalev & Faizullov)= 4.2 J/cm^2 (1.7 ns pulse rate)

   Potassium chloride has also been used to create heat packs which employ
   exothermic chemical reactions ^[121][3], but these are no longer being
   created due to cheaper and more efficient methods such as the oxidation
   of metals ('Hot Hands', one time use products) or the crystallization
   of sodium acetate (multiple use products).

[[122]edit] Biological and medical properties

   Potassium is vital in the [123]human body and oral potassium chloride
   is the common means to replenish it, although it can also be diluted
   and given [124]intravenously (of course, in concentrations much lower
   than those used in executions). It can be used as a [125]salt
   substitute for [126]food, but due to its weak, bitter, unsalty
   [127]flavor, it is usually mixed with regular salt (sodium chloride),
   for this purpose to improve the [128]taste (for example, in Morton Lite
   Salt^[129][4]). Medically it is used in the treatment of
   [130]hypokalemia and associated conditions, for [131]digitalis
   [132]poisoning, and as an [133]electrolyte replenisher. Brand names
   include K-Dur, Klor-Con, Micro-K, and Kaon Cl. Side effects can include
   [134]gastrointestinal discomfort including [135]nausea and
   [136]vomiting, [137]diarrhea and [138]bleeding of the digestive tract.
   [139]Overdoses cause [140]hyperkalemia which can lead to
   [141]paresthesia, [142]cardiac conduction blocks, [143]fibrillation,
   [144]arrhythmias, and [145]sclerosis.

   Dr. [146]Jack Kevorkian's [147]thanatron machine injected a lethal dose
   of potassium chloride into the patient, which caused the heart to stop
   functioning, after a [148]sodium thiopental-induced coma was achieved.
   A similar device, the [149]German 'Perfusor', also uses potassium
   chloride as a suicide aid.^[150][5]

[[151]edit] Physical properties

   Potassium chloride has a crystalline structure like many other salts.
   Its structure is face-centered cubic. Its [152]lattice constant is
   roughly 630 [153]picometers.

   In [154]chemistry and [155]physics it is a very commonly used as a
   standard, for example as a [156]calibration standard solution in
   measuring [157]electrical conductivity of (ionic) solutions, since
   carefully prepared KCl solutions have well-reproducible and
   well-repeatable measurable properties.

[[170]edit] Precautions

   Orally, KCl is toxic in excess; the [171]LD[50] is around 2500
   [172]mg/kg (meaning that a lethal dose for 50% of people weighing 75 kg
   (165 [173]lb) is about 190 g (6.7 [174]ounces), or about 38 teaspoons).
   [175]Table salt is about as toxic. Intravenously this is reduced to
   just over 100 mg/kg, but of more concern are its severe effects on the
   cardiac [176]muscles; high doses can cause [177]cardiac arrest and
   rapid [178]death, ergo its aforementioned use as the third and final
   drug delivered in the lethal injection process.
