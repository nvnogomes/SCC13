   The Durant was a make of [9]automobile assembled by [10]Durant Motors
   Corporation of [11]New York, New York from 1921 to 1926 and again from
   1928 to 1932. Durant Motors was founded by [12]William Crapo Durant
   (also known as Billy Durant) after he was terminated as the head of
   [13]General Motors. Billy Durant's intent was to build an automotive
   empire that could one day challenge General Motors.

   The Durant automobile is considered to be an example of an "assembled"
   automobile because so many of its components were obtained from outside
   suppliers. From 1921 to 1926 the vehicle was powered by a four cylinder
   [14]Continental engine. The vehicle was directed at the [15]Oakland
   automobile price point.

   Production of the vehicle was suspended for the 1926 and 1927 model
   years. When the Durant was reintroduced, the car was redesigned and
   powered by a six cylinder Continental engine; some of the early
   vehicles were marketed as the "Durant-Star". Bodies for the vehicle
   were supplied by [16]Budd Company. In 1930, some Durants were built
   with all steel bodies, also supplied by Budd.

   Durant Motors was found [17]insolvent and automobile production ended
   early in 1932.
