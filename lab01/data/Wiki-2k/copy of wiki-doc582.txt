[[51]edit] History

[[52]edit] Czechoslovakian League

   The club was founded towards the end of 1908 under the Hungarian name
   Zsolnai Testgyakorlk Kre. Between the two world wars, when for a brief
   time Slovakia became an independent nation, the club won Slovakian
   championship twice, in 1928 and 1929. In total, the club had played 31
   seasons in the First Division of the Czechoslovakian League spanning
   from 1925 to 1993. Remarkable remains 1945-46 season as they clinched
   the third place, only adrift of the likes of [53]Sparta Prague and
   [54]Slavia Prague. As a mark of honour to the best slovak team in this
   competition [55]K ilina was named 'Unofficial Slovak Champion'.

   Many consider 1961 a milestone in club's history. Firstly, the team
   reached the final of the National Cup, where they lost to [56]Dukla
   Prague, the eventual Czechoslovakian champion. Despite the defeat, for
   the first time in history a club then known as [57]Dynamo ilina broke
   into Europe to contest in the [58]UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Notable 3-2
   and 1-0 victories over [59]Olympiacos Piraeus moved them in
   quarter-finals, however ambitious slovak team was ultimately knocked
   out by a previous year winner [60]ACF Fiorentina. Although ilina
   grabbed a promising 3-2 victory at home, Fiorentina proved to be too
   strong and went through by winning second leg 2-0.

   In late sixties the club was renamed [61]TJ ZVL ilina and had
   frequently participated in European contests for several more years,
   though with no major success. 1973-74 season counts for only exception
   as they progressed to the final of [62]Mitropa Cup however suffered
   defeat from [63]Tatabnyai Bnysz. A fifth spot in Czechoslovakian league
   in the same year turned out to be the last notable achievement the club
   had made until winning their first historic title.

[[64]edit] New era after 1993

   Following dissolution of [65]Czechoslovakia in 1993, MK ilina has been
   a regular participant in the [66]Slovak Superliga with the exception of
   1995-96 season after relegation to the second division. After lengthy
   two decades since the last European contest the club qualified for the
   [67]Intertoto Cup in 1997 and 1999, however with no major success on
   both occasions. A valuable 3-1 victory over [68]FK Austria Wien and 1-1
   draw with [69]Odra Wodzisaw was not enough to progress into next stage,
   while next qualification easy 4-0 double-legged win over [70]Herflge
   Boldklub was followed by 4-2 loss to [71]FC Metz in the second round.

   Significantly, in the autumn of 2000, former Czechoslovakian defender
   [72]Ladislav Jurkemik joined the club as a new manager and under his
   guidance the team became renowned for its winning mentality. After his
   departure halfway through the 2001-02 season to become a manager of the
   Slovak national team the club appointed Czech coach [73]Leo Kalvoda who
   cruised the team to their first title to clinch it four rounds before
   the end of season.

   In the [74]2002-03 season, now under the management of Milan Leick, the
   club succeeded in retaining its national championship having famously
   won a crucial away game when beating their only contender in title race
   [75]Slovan Bratislava . Prolific striker [76]Marek Mintal scored the
   late winner in a fantastic style and this was proved to be his last
   goal for recrowned Slovakian champion before his move to [77]1. FC
   Nuremberg.

   The following campaign begun in a disappointing way and after
   humilliating exit from UEFA Cup having lost to Dutch side [78]FC
   Utrecht 0-6 on aggregate coach Leick was axed instantly. Although,
   prior to this game the club progressed into third qualifying round of
   [79]Champions League beating Israeli champions [80]Maccabi Tel Aviv 2-1
   on aggregate, next round opponent proved to be a massive challenge for
   Slovakian team and were eliminated by [81]Chelsea FC losing both legs
   0-5 on aggregate. Following the departure of sacked manager, board had
   surprisingly appointed then quite unknown Czech coach Juraj Simurka.
   However his reign had lasted only three months after failing to make
   desired impact and just to be replaced by [82]Ladislav Jurkemik who was
   recalled for his second spell with north Slovakian club. Leading the
   current champions to 10 priceless consecutive victories turned out to
   be enough to clinch the third successive title though narrowly on a
   goal difference.

   After [83]Slovan Bratislava, MK ilina became only the second club to
   win three Slovakian titles.

   The team's performances in next two seasons faded while they lacked the
   quality they had been famous for during their winning campaigns. In
   pursuit of silverware numerous players were signed over next two years.
   In the span of only fourteen months, three managers; the reputable
   Karol Pecze, his successor Milan Nemec and eventually Marijan Vlak were
   in charge over the team. Since the results and performances never met
   the expectations, Vlak ended his reign immediately at the end of
   2005-06 season after club failed to reach UEFA Cup spot only to finish
   fourth.

   Unforgettable 2006-07 season will be remembered amongst the supporters
   for many years to come as club won its fourth title with a sensational
   display during the entire campaign having scored astonishing 99 goals.
   Well deserved credit to a new appointed manager [84]Pavel Vrba whose
   tactics complemented with several new players proved to be an desired
   recipe for success and the team dominated throughout the season
   performing an enjoyable attacking football that was applauded all
   across the country.

   Shortly after the start of [85]2007-08 season "ooni" had another chance
   to play a Champions League first qualifying round against Luxembourg
   side [86]F91 Dudelange and went through after a turbulent aggregate
   score 7-5. As there has been an arch rivalry between Slovakian and
   Czech teams since the split up, being tied up with [87]Slavia Prague in
   second qualifying round had been widely welcomed and eagerly awaited
   clash. Disappointingly, MK ilina was knocked out by Czech champions
   only on penalties after two goalless draws. Eventually, the team had
   finished second in domestic league to be guaranteed more European
   football next season.

   Under the management of [88]Pavel Vrba the club begun [89]2008-09
   campaign in a striking style having won first five games with an
   impressive score 16-1 and in the meantime defeated Belarus [90]FC
   MTZ-RIPO 3-2 on aggregate in the [91]2008/09 UEFA Cup [92]first
   qualifying round. For the second year running they were drawn to play
   another Czech team [93]FC Slovan Liberec. Winning both legs 2-1 moved
   them even closer to a long awaited entry into a group stage providing
   they would eliminate Bulgarian [94]PFC Levski Sofia. Club's drop in
   form in several domestic league games as well as being held 1-1 at home
   by Levski was followed by surprising decision to part a company with
   [95]Pavel Vrba leaving most supporters in a dismay. Seemingly gambling
   step to appoint [96]Dusan Radolsky prior to the crucial second leg in
   Sofia did not proved to be wrong and came to fruition immediately as MK
   ilina made it through when they managed to beat [97]Levski 1-0 away and
   historically earned a spot in [98]UEFA Cup 200809 group stage. The club
   was drawn to play in Group F alongside [99]Hamburger SV, [100]AFC Ajax,
   [101]Slavia Prague and [102]Aston Villa. They were the lowest ranked
   side of all 40 clubs in this stage of competition. Although they
   famously beat [103]Aston Villa [104]2-1 at [105]Villa Park in their
   last group game, the club finished fourth and did not advance to the
   knockout stages of the competition.

   One of the club's most notable players of the modern time is [106]Marek
   Mintl, being the captain and top scorer in club's two consecutive
   winning seasons 2001-02 and 2002-03 netting 21 and 20 goals
   respectively who currently plays for [107]1. FC Nuremberg.

   Stadium Pod Dubom

   The original stadium was built in 1941 although the ground had been in
   use since club's foundation in 1909 . As of 2002, the club considered
   undertaking an extensive renovation of the stadium, which has since
   been in constant process of redevelopment.

   expanded (as of 2007), with major redevelopment on West Stand (new
   hospitality boxes, increased capacity) including several alterations on
   the North Stand and South Stand, as to extra tiers being added, which
   have all been covered. Outward facing wall on North Stand is yet to be
   completed.

   modern security installations as monitoring system. Intensity of
   floodlighting is 1,400 lux. There is also a large screen inside the
   ground for showing highlights of matchdays.

   At the end of 2007-08 campaign the East Stand has been closed down as a
   further part of ongoing reconstruction. Brand new stand consisting of
   upper and lower tiers will have been built prior to 2009-10 campaign
   and is expected to give a completely new design and comfort. Final
   completition of the whole sport complex that will provide various
   shopping and leisure facilities is scheduled for 2011-12 season and
   current capacity (comprising three stands only) 8,400 seats will be
   increased to hold a crowd of 15,000 spectators.
