   A [19]Yamaha RY30 Drum Machine

   A drum machine is an [20]electronic musical instrument designed to
   imitate the [21]sound of [22]drums and/or other [23]percussion
   instruments. Drum machines are very useful instruments for a wide
   variety of musical genres, not just purely [24]electronic music. They
   are also a common necessity when [25]session drummers are not available
   or desired.

   Most modern drum machines are [26]sequencers with a sample playback
   ([27]rompler) or [28]synthesizer component that specializes in the
   reproduction of drum [29]timbres as well as the sound of other
   traditional percussion instruments. Though features vary from model to
   model, many modern drum machines can also produce unique sounds (though
   usually percussive in nature), and allow the user to compose unique
   [30]drum beats.

[[42]edit] History

[[43]edit] Early drum machines

   Music educator [44]Joseph Schillinger and the [45]Rhythmicon (1932)

   Early drum machines were often referred to as "[46]rhythm machines." In
   193032, the spectacularly innovative and complex [47]Rhythmicon was
   realized by [48]Lon Theremin on the commission of composer-theorist
   [49]Henry Cowell, who wanted an instrument with which to play
   compositions whose multiple [50]rhythmic patterns, based on the
   [51]overtone series, were far too difficult to perform on existing
   keyboard instruments. The invention could produce sixteen different
   rhythms, each associated with a particular [52]pitch, either
   individually or in any combination, including in mass, if desired.
   Received with considerable interest when it was publicly introduced in
   1932, the Rhythmicon was soon set aside by Cowell and was virtually
   forgotten for decades. The next generation of rhythm machines played
   only preprogrammed rhythms such as [53]mambo, [54]tango, or the like.

   In 1947 Californian Harry Chamberlin constructed a tape loop based drum
   machine called the Chamberlin Rhythmate. It had 14 tape loops with a
   sliding head that allowed playback of different tracks on each piece of
   tape, or a blending between them. It contained a volume and a
   pitch/speed control and also had a separate amplifier with bass,
   treble, and volume controls, and an input jack for a guitar, microphone
   or other instrument. The tape loops were of real acoustic jazz drum
   kits playing different style beats, with some additions to tracks such
   as bongos, clave, castanets, etc.

   In 1959 [55]Wurlitzer released an electro-mechanical drum machine
   called the Sideman, which was the first ever commercially-produced drum
   machine. The Sideman was intended as a percussive accompaniment for the
   Wurlitzer organ range. The Sideman offered a choice of 12
   electronically generated, predefined rhythm patterns with variable
   tempos. The sound source was a series of vacuum tubes which created 10
   preset electronic drum sounds. The drum sounds were 'sequenced' by a
   set of rotating discs with metal contacts on the edge, spaced in a
   certain pattern to generate parts of a particular rhythm. Combinations
   of these different sets of rhythms and drum sounds created popular
   rhythmic patterns of the day, eg waltzes, fox trots etc. These
   combinations were selected by a rotary knob on the top of the Sideman
   box. The tempo of the patterns was controlled by a slider that
   increased the speed of rotation of the disc. The Sideman had a panel of
   10 buttons for manually triggering drum sounds, and a remote player to
   control the machine while playing from an organ keyboard. The Sideman
   was housed in a wooden cabinet that contained the sound generating
   circuitry, amplifier and speaker.

   In 1960 [56]Raymond Scott constructed the Rhythm Synthesizer, and in
   1963 a drum machine called Bandito the Bongo Artist. Scott's machines
   were used for recording his infamous "[57]Soothing Sounds for Baby"
   series (1964).

   The first widely commercially available rhythm machines were included
   in organs in the late 1960s, and were intended to accompany the
   organist.

   The first successful drum machine was the Rhythm Ace. It was produced
   by a company then called Ace Tone (later called [58]Roland). In 1964 it
   developed the Ace Electronics R1 Rhythm Ace. The R1 was possibly the
   world's first fully transistorised rhythm machine but, despite interest
   and sample orders from American manufacturers, it didn't achieve a
   wider success. The machine produced sounds when the user pressed
   buttons, much like today's drum pads, but it offered no pre-programmed
   patterns. The FR1 Rhythm Ace appeared in 1967. The positive response
   was immediate, and the FR1 was adopted by the Hammond Organ Company for
   incorporation within its latest line of organs. The Rhythm Ace was a
   preset-only unit; it was not possible for the user to alter or modify
   the pre-programmed rhythms.

   A number of other preset drum machines were released in the 1970s. The
   first major pop song to use a drum machine was a cover version of
   [59]Sly & the Family Stone's "Somebody's Watching You" recorded by
   [60]Little Sister. The song, produced and composed by [61]Sly Stone,
   entered the R&B charts in 1971. Drum machine tracks were also heavily
   used on the Sly & the Family Stone album There's a Riot Goin' On,
   released the same year. The German [62]krautrock band [63]Can also used
   a drum machine on their album [64]Tago Mago (1971), especially in the
   song "Peking O". The first album on which a drum machine produced all
   the percussion was [65]Arthur Brown/Kingdom Come's Journey, recorded in
   November 1972 using a Bentley Rhythm Ace.

[[66]edit] Drum sound synthesis

   GM Standard Drum Map

   A key difference between such early machines and more modern equipment
   is that they used [67]analog [68]sound synthesis rather than
   [69]digital [70]sampling in order to generate their sounds. For
   example, a [71]snare drum or [72]maraca sound would typically be
   created using a burst of [73]white noise whereas a [74]bass drum sound
   would be made using [75]sine waves or other basic [76]waveforms. This
   meant that while the resulting sound was not very close to that of the
   real instrument, each model tended to have a unique character. For this
   reason, many of these early machines have achieved a certain "cult
   status" and are now sought after by [77]DJs and [78]producers for use
   in production of modern [79]electronic music.

[[80]edit] Programmable drum machines

   The first stand-alone drum machine, the [81]PAiA Programmable Drum Set,
   also happened to be the very first programmable drum machine. It was
   first introduced in 1975^[82][1], and was sold as a kit with parts and
   instructions which the buyer would use to build the machine.

   In 1978, the [83]Roland CR-78 drum machine was released. It was one of
   the first programmable rhythm machines, and had four memory locations
   which allowed users to store their own patterns. The following year,
   Roland offered the Boss DR-55. It was the first fully programmable drum
   machine for under $200. The DR-55 had four sounds, and enough memory
   for only 16 rhythms. Hardly passable by modern standards, but in its
   time, the DR-55 was a relatively affordable breakthrough.

[[84]edit] Digital sampling

   The [85]Linn LM-1 Drum Computer (released in 1980, and expensive at
   $4,999) was the first drum machine to use digital samples. Only 500
   were ever made, but the list of those who owned them was impressive.
   Its distinctive sound almost defines 1980s pop, and it can be heard on
   hundreds of hit records from the era, including The [86]Human League's
   Dare, [87]Gary Numan's Dance, and [88]Ric Ocasek's Beatitude.
   [89]Prince bought one of the very first LM-1s and used it on nearly all
   of his most popular recordings, including 1999 and Purple Rain.

   Many of the drum sounds on the LM-1 were composed of two chips that
   were triggered at the same time, and each voice was individually
   tunable with individual outputs. Due to memory limitations, a [90]crash
   cymbal sound was not available except as an expensive third-party
   modification. A cheaper version of the LM-1 was released in 1982 called
   the LM-2 (or simply [91]LinnDrum). It cost around $3,000 and not all of
   its voices were tunable, making it less desirable than the original
   LM-1. The Linndrum included a crash cymbal sound as standard and, like
   its predecessor the LM-1, featured swappable sound chips. The Linndrum
   can be heard on records such as [92]Men Without Hats' Rhythm of Youth
   and [93]The Cars' Heartbeat City.

   It was feared the LM-1 would put every session drummer in Los Angeles
   out of work and it caused many of L.A's top session drummers ([94]Jeff
   Porcaro is one example) to purchase their own drum machines and learn
   to program them themselves in order to stay employed.

   Following the success of the LM-1, [95]Oberheim introduced the [96]DMX,
   which also featured digitally-sampled sounds and a "swing" feature
   similar to the one found on the Linn machines. It became very popular
   in its own right, becoming a staple of the nascent hip-hop scene.

   Other manufacturers soon began to produce machines, eg the
   [97]Sequential Circuits Drum-Traks and Tom, the [98]E-Mu Drumulator and
   the [99]Yamaha RX11.

   The 1986 [100]SpecDrum by [101]Cheetah Marketing made drum machines
   inexpensive by offering a drum machine for 30 when similar models cost
   around 250.^[102][2]

[[103]edit] Roland TR-808 and TR-909 machines

   The famous [104]Roland TR-808 was also launched in 1980. At the time it
   was received with little fanfare, as it did not have digitally sampled
   sounds; drum machines using digital samples were much more popular. In
   time, though, the TR-808, along with its successor, the [105]TR-909
   (released in 1983), would become a fixture of the burgeoning
   underground dance, techno, and hip-hop genres, mainly because of its
   low cost (relative to that of the Linn machines), and the unique
   character of its analogue-generated sounds. In a somewhat ironic twist
   it is the analogue-based Roland machines that have endured over time as
   the Linn sound became somewhat overused and dated by the end of the
   decade. The TR-808 and TR-909's beats have since been widely featured
   in [106]pop music, and can be heard on countless recordings up to the
   present day.

[[107]edit] Programming

   Programming can be done (depending on the machine) in real time: the
   user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a
   [108]drum kit were being played; or using step-sequencing: the pattern
   is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by
   placing them, as with the TR-808 and TR-909, along a 16-step bar. For
   example, a generic 4-on-the-floor dance pattern could be made by
   placing a closed high hat on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th steps, then a
   kick drum on the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th steps, and a clap on the 5th
   and 13th. This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain
   [109]fills, [110]break-downs and other elements that the programmer
   sees fit, which in turn could be sequenced essentially the drum machine
   plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the
   programmer has chosen. The machine will [111]quantize entries that are
   slightly off-beat in order to make them exactly in time.

   If the drum machine has [112]MIDI connectivity, then one could program
   the drum machine with a computer or another MIDI device.

[[113]edit] MIDI breakthrough

   Because these early drum machines came out before the introduction of
   [114]MIDI in 1983, they used a variety of methods of having their
   rhythms synchronized to other electronic devices. Some used a method of
   synchronization called [115]DIN-sync, or sync-24. Some of these
   machines also output [116]analog [117]CV/Gate voltages that could be
   used to synchronize or control analog [118]synthesizers and other music
   equipment. The [119]Oberheim DMX came with a feature allowing it to be
   synchronized to its proprietary Oberheim Parallel Buss interfacing
   system, developed prior to the introduction of MIDI.

   By the year 2000, standalone drum machines became much less common,
   being partly supplanted by general-purpose hardware samplers controlled
   by sequencers (built-in or external), software-based sequencing and
   sampling and the use of loops, and [120]music workstations with
   integrated sequencing and drum sounds. TR-808 and other digitized drum
   machine sounds can be found in archives on the Internet. However,
   traditional drum machines are still being made by companies such as
   Roland Corporation (under the name [121]Boss), [122]Zoom, [123]Korg and
   [124]Alesis, whose [125]SR-16 drum machine has remained popular since
   it was introduced in 1991.

   There are percussion-specific [126]sound modules that can be triggered
   by pickups, [127]trigger pads, or through MIDI. These are called
   [128]drum modules; the Alesis D4 and Roland TD-8 are popular examples.
   Unless such a sound module also features a sequencer, it is, strictly
   speaking, not a drum machine.
