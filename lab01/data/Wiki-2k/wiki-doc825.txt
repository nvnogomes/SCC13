   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Ed Byrne (born 1963) is a [8]Canadian [9]politician, and a member of
   the [10]House of Assembly of the province of [11]Newfoundland and
   Labrador.

   Byrne studied at [12]Memorial University of Newfoundland where towards
   a joint Bachelor of Arts / Bachelor of Education program majoring
   conjointly in [13]Newfoundland Studies and Religious Studies. In 1984,
   he was elected President of the Universitys Council of the Students
   Union.

   He began his career as an adult educator specializing in curriculum
   development and serving as a skills training coordinator, and he went
   on to serve as Administrator of the Atlantic Labour Training Trust
   Fund. For five years, as well, he served as a management consultant.

   Byrne married the daughter of Honourable Senator [14]Gerry Ottenheimer,
   who was then serving as the Deputy-[15]Speaker of the [16]Senate of
   Canada. Subsequently, Byrne was elected to represent the district of
   Kilbride in the provincial elections of 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2003. As a
   [17]Progressive Conservative Member of the [18]House of Assembly, he
   served in several shadow portfolios including Post-secondary Education,
   Employment and Labour Relations, Environment, and Industry, Trade and
   Technology; and as Chair of the Public Accounts Committee.

   He served as Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and
   [19]Leader of the Opposition from 1998 to 2001. He stepped aside in
   2001 to allow successfully [20]St. John's [21]businessman [22]Danny
   Williams to assume the leadership. Williams and the Progressive
   Conservatives then went on to win the 2003 provincial election.

   Byrne was appointed as the Minister of the Departments of Mines and
   Energy and Forest Resources and Agrifoods (now known collectively as
   the Department of Natural Resources) and Government House Leader on
   November 6, 2003 by Premier [23]Williams, positions he held until June
   21, 2006.

[[24]edit] Resignation as cabinet minister

   On June 21, 2006, Premier [25]Danny Williams announced that he had he
   requested the Byrne's resignation as a result of an audit of the
   financial records of the [26]House of Assembly by the Auditor General
   of the province. The resignation was requested after the Auditor
   General expressed concern to the [27]Speaker of the House of Assembly
   over financial issues. Byrne complied with the request to step aside
   effective immediately.

   On June 22, 2006, the provincial Auditor General released a report on
   Byrne's constituency allowance claims in the 2003 and 2004 fiscal
   years. While Byrne had been eligible for a maximum claim of $31,500 for
   that period, the Auditor General had found evidence that he had claimed
   a total of $326,642 in excess of that amount. The Auditor General
   recommended that the case be turned over to the Department of Justice
   for review.

   The Auditor General also reported, on June 22, that three other members
   of the [28]House of Assembly were being investigated for similar
   actions, one former [29]Liberal member, one sitting [30]Liberal member,
   and one sitting [31]New Democratic Party member.

   On June 23, the [32]Royal Newfoundland Constabulary began a criminal
   investigation based on the findings of the Auditor General.

   Former N.L. minister Byrne pleads guilty to fraud Will ask for
   conditional sentence, defence lawyer says Last Updated: Friday, January

   CBC News Ed Byrne was forced to resign as natural resources minister in
   June 2006, at the start of the legislative spending scandal. (CBC)

   A disgraced former Newfoundland and Labrador cabinet minister pleaded
   guilty Friday to charges that included defrauding the government of
   money paid through his legislative allowance.

   Ed Byrne, who resigned as natural resources minister in June 2006 when
   a scandal over legislative spending began to rock Newfoundland and
   Labrador politics, entered the plea Friday morning in provincial court
   in St. John's.

   Byrne pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud, including one charge of
   fraud against the government, a crime that was formerly known as
   influence peddling.

   Other charges, including two counts of fraud, breach of trust and
   uttering forged documents, are being withdrawn.

   Byrne declined comment to reporters before and after his appearance in
   court.

   "Well, I'm not in a position to say anything. I think you'll understand
   that," he said.

   Defence lawyer Bob Simmonds said he will ask for a conditional
   sentence. If granted, it would mean that Byrne would avoid serving time
   in jail.

   Byrne will return to court in April for a sentencing hearing.

   As well, Simmonds told the court that Byrne will repay more than
   $100,000 to the Newfoundland and Labrador government.

   Byrne's fall from grace has been steep and hard. A former leader of the
   now-governing Progressive Conservatives, he had been the chief
   lieutenant to Premier Danny Williams, having served as government house
   leader until the scandal broke.

   Byrne was one of five men four politicians and a senior civil servant
   to be charged following a Royal Newfoundland Constabulary investigation
   into what has often been called Newfoundland and Labrador's legislative
   spending scandal.

   The police investigation was launched after Auditor General John
   Noseworthy released a series of reports showing that the four
   politicians, as well as another who was not charged, had received a
   total of $1.6 million more than their entitlements in tax-free
   constituency allowances.

   Noseworthy's first report found that Byrne had received more than 10
   times his constituency allowance over a two-year period.

   In a subsequent report, Noseworthy found that Byrne had received
   payments of $467,653 beyond his entitlements.

   Byrne, 45, had been expected to plead guilty. Simmonds indicated weeks
   ago that the criminal charges could be dealt with in just two days.

   Even so, Byrne, in one of his last public appearances in November 2006,
   said he would be vindicated.

   "I believe that when it does conclude itself, my name will be cleared,"
   Byrne said in an interview at the time with CBC News.

   A month later, Byrne resigned his St. John's-area seat of Kilbride.

   He was charged in April 2008 with impaired driving. He later pleaded
   not guilty to that charge.

   Byrne's legal troubles are not over. He has retained lawyer Tom Fraize
   to represent him in a civil action brought by the Newfoundland and
   Labrador government, which is attempting to recoup overpayments made
   through constituency allowances.

   The first person named in the legislative spending scandal, Byrne's is
   also the first case to be resolved.

   Former Liberal cabinet ministers Wally Andersen and Jim Walsh have not
   yet been tried. Former New Democrat Randy Collins is also awaiting
   trial.

   The Crown has also charged Bill Murray, the former director of finance
   at the house of assembly, who, Noseworthy said, played a critical role
   in the legislative spending issue. Murray faces seven charges,
   including fraud against the government, fraud over $5,000, breach of
   trust and uttering forged documents.

[[34]edit] Resignation as M.H.A.

   Ed Byrne announced on November 28th that he was resigning from
   provincial politics effective [35]January 1 2007.
