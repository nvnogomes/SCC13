   Edward A. Reep (1918- ) Born: [16]Brooklyn, NY; Studied: Art Center
   School in Los Angeles ([17]Art Center College of Design) ; Member:
   American Watercolor Society, California Water Color Society. Edward
   Reep grew up in [18]Southern California. He became interested in
   watercolor painting while studying with Stanley Reckless and received
   further instruction from Barse Miller. During [19]World War II, he
   became a combat artist for the [20]United States Army and was sent to
   [21]Italy. With the war going on all around him, Reep managed to paint
   depictions of what was happening. These watercolor and gouache works
   became property of the War Department at [22]The Pentagon. Additional
   war-time works produced after 1945 are in various museums including the
   [23]National Museum of American Art in [24]Washington, D.C.

   As a result of his outstanding contributions to war art, Reep was
   awarded a [25]Guggenheim Fellowship to help finance his pursuit of art.
   From 1947 to 1950, he painted, exhibited and taught art at the Art
   Center School ([26]Art Center College of Design) . In the 1950s, he
   worked with one of his former teachers, Emil Bisttram, at the Bisttram
   School of Art. He also began a nineteen year job as an art instructor
   for the [27]Chouinard Art Institute during this era.

   Although he has never restricted himself to any one medium, Reep has
   often painted with watercolors throughout his career. His works from
   the late 1930s are classic California Style regional watercolors. By
   the 1950s, he was working in the more modern abstract style for which
   he received several important awards and some national exposure. Since
   that time, he has continued to develop his personal style of art. He
   was hired as chairman of the art department and honored as Artist in
   Residence at [28]East Carolina University and has authored two books:
   The Content of Watercolor and A Combat Artist in World War II.
