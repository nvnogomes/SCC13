   Boers watch the fighting at Dundee in 1899

   The coal mining town of Dundee is situated in a valley of the
   Biggarsberg mountains in [9]KwaZulu-Natal, [10]South Africa ([11]2810S
   3014E / 28.167S 30.233E / -28.167; 30.233). It is part of the Endumeni
   Local Municipality, Umzinyathi District. It is rich in [12]coal
   deposits. More populous than the town of Dundee itself is its adjacent
   township named Sibongile.

[[13]edit] History

     * The [14]Boers reported surface coal here and named one of the
       streams Steenkoolspruit ([15]Dutch for Coal Stream).
     * Peter Smith, a [16]Scottish settler started sending wagonloads of
       coal which was discovered close to the surface to be sold in
       [17]Pietermaritzburg. This actually started the coal industry in
       Natal.
     * The first geological survey of the Natal coalfields was made in
       1880 and proved that there were workable coal deposits.
     * In 1882 a town was laid out and named after Smiths Scottish
       hometown [18]Dundee.
     * Smith with partners Dugald MacPhail and Charles Wilson floated the
       Dundee Coal and Estate Company on the [19]London Stock Exchange in
       1899.
     * The [20]British start massing troops at Dundee and was given an
       ultimatum by the Boers to remove the troops. On [21]20 October
       [22]1899, the first shots of the [23]Boer War were fired. The news
       of this battle hit the headlines in [24]Britain, the "Battle of
       Glencoe", which was corrected the following day to the "Battle of
       Dundee" and on the third day to the "Battle of Talana." It was on
       the slopes of Talana Hill that the British army troops wore khaki
       uniforms for the first time in battle. After the battle, the
       British troops retired to [25]Ladysmith and [26]Boer forces
       occupied the town, renaming it Meyersdorp. This occupation lasted
       seven months. Dundee was relieved after the battle of Helpmekaar in
       May 1900.
     * The town's folk who had left before or shortly after the battle
       returned and the town began to flourish again. Dundee soon emerged
       as a boomtown graced with stately homes and the first theatre north
       of Port Natal ([27]Durban).
     * Pioneer traders from the [28]Indian sub-continent settled here
       during the following decade, when Dundee became the meeting place
       of seven roads into the hinterland and coast of Africa.
