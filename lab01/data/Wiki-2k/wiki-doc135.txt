   New Jersey currently allows [145]domestic partnerships and [146]civil
   unions for same-sex couples. In addition, out-of-state [147]same-sex
   marriages are equivalent to civil unions in the state. On December 10,
   2008, a state commission formed to review civil unions released a
   report that same-sex couples cannot achieve equality under the current
   law; the commission recommended New Jersey become the next U.S. state
   to legalize same-sex marriage.^[148][1]

[[161]edit] Domestic Partnerships

   The [162]New Jersey Legislature enacted the Domestic Partnership Act,
   P.L.2003, c. 246, on [163]January 12, [164]2004, which came into effect
   on [165]July 10, [166]2004. The law made domestic partnerships
   available to all same-sex couples, as well as to different-sex couples
   aged 62 and older. The domestic partnership statute provides "limited
   healthcare, inheritance, property rights and other rights and
   obligations" but "[does] not approach the broad array of rights and
   obligations afforded to married couples." ^[167][2] For example, as
   Lambda Legal states, the law "required health and pension benefits
   [only] for state employees it was voluntary for other employers and did
   not require family leave to care for an ill partner."^[168][3]

   The domestic partnership statute remains in place even though New
   Jersey has since enacted a civil union statute. Couples in an existing
   domestic partnership are not required to enter a civil union. However,
   new domestic partnerships are available only to couples in which both
   partners are 62 and over, whether same-sex or
   different-sex.^[169][2]^[170][3]

[[171]edit] Civil Unions

[[172]edit] Lewis v. Harris

          Main article: [173]Lewis v. Harris

   On [174]October 25, [175]2006, the [176]Supreme Court of New Jersey
   unanimously ruled in [177]Lewis v. Harris that the "unequal
   dispensation of rights and benefits to committed same-sex partners can
   no longer be tolerated under our State Constitution." With the Harris
   decision, [178]gay couples were granted the same rights, benefits and
   responsibilities as [179]heterosexual couples with respect to their
   relationships.

   While the decision was widely reported as a 4-3 split, the differences
   between the Justices on the Court were on whether only the provision of
   marriage rights to same-sex couples would resolve the constitutional
   defect, or whether another statutory scheme would pass constitutional
   scrutiny. The Court avoided the question of what to call the legal
   status, leaving that to, as the majority stated, the "crucible of the
   democratic process."

   The dissent, led by then-Chief Justice [180]Deborah T. Poritz,
   chastised the junior members of the Court who said that anything other
   than marriage would provide equal rights: "What we name things matters,
   language matters...Labels set people apart surely as physical
   separation on a bus or in school facilities...By excluding same-sex
   couples from civil marriage, the State declares that it is legitimate
   to differentiate between their commitments and the commitments of
   heterosexual couples. Ultimately the message is that what same-sex
   couples have is not as important or as significant as "real" marriage,
   that such lesser relationships cannot have the name of marriage."

   The court gave the state legislature six months to enact legislation
   providing for civil unions.

[[181]edit] Civil Union Act

   On [182]December 14, [183]2006, the [184]New Jersey Legislature passed
   a bill providing for civil unions^[185][4] which was signed into law by
   the [186]Governor [187]Jon Corzine on [188]December 21, [189]2006. The
   Civil Union Act came into effect on [190]February 19, [191]2007.

   Same-sex couples who enter into a civil union are provided almost all
   of the rights granted to married couples under New Jersey state law.
   However, under the provisions of the federal [192]Defense of Marriage
   Act or [193]DOMA, same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or
   domestic partnerships do not have any right or entitlement to the 1,138
   rights that a married couple has under federal law.^[194][5].

   The law provides^[195][4] for the creation of a Civil Unions Review
   Commission that will evaluate the law's effectiveness and any problems
   resulting therefrom, and will report every six months for three years
   following enactment to assess the impact of the law. The first meeting
   of the Civil Unions Review Commission took place on June 18, 2007. The
   Commission elected a chair, Frank Vespa-Papaleo, the current Director
   of the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights, and the Commission plans on
   meeting monthly as well as conducting periodic public meetings.

   According to the new civil union law,^[196][4] when a same-sex couple
   receives a civil union, their domestic partnership is automatically
   terminated by the civil union. However, those couples who remain in
   domestic partnerships and elect to not enter into a civil union will be
   allowed to remain as domestic partners.

[[197]edit] Criticisms

   The [198]New Jersey State Bar Association took a formal position
   against the adoption of Civil Unions law, citing inherent and obvious
   problems and confusion the law has for the state's citizens and the
   legal representation. In addition, the NJSBA formally endorsed the
   marriage bill proposed by openly gay Assemblyman [199]Reed Gusciora,
   saying that only marriage equality would meet the standard mandated by
   the NJ Supreme Court in its Lewis decision.

   In addition, newspapers have also covered the apparent failure of the
   civil union law, once it became effective on February 19, 2007, to
   provide equal protection consistently to same-sex couples in New
   Jersey. The New York Times, the Star-Ledger and the Bergen Record have
   each done investigative stories on employers and insurers failing to
   provide benefits to civil unioned couples.

   During the first 90 days of the law, 852 same-sex couples had gotten
   civil-unioned, according to the [200]New Jersey Department of Health
   and Senior Services. During the same 90 days, the LGBT civil rights
   organization Garden State Equality reported that it has received
   alleged complaints from 102 couples denied benefits by employers or
   insurers.

   On May 22, 2007, the Star-Ledger reported that the New Jersey Division
   on Civil Rights has received at least 270 inquiries from civil-unioned
   couples denied benefits by employers or insurers. As of June 18, 2007,
   however, only 2 complaints had actually been filed with the NJ Division
   of Civil Rights, it was reported at the first meeting of the Civil
   Unions Review Commission.

[[201]edit] Denial of benefits by employers

   According to the LGBT civil rights organization Garden State Equality,
   by the end of July 2007, 211 of the 1,358 couples (1 out of 7) who had
   entered New Jersey civil unions since February 19 had "reported to
   Garden State Equality that their employers refused to recognize their
   civil unions." ^[202][6] Among the companies flouting state law were
   shipping companies [203]UPS, [204]FedEx, and [205]DHL, as well as a
   number of [206]Fortune 500 companies.

   UPS spokesman Norman Black had claimed that the company's collective
   bargaining agreement with the [207]Teamsters union, representing about
   8,700 UPS employees in New Jersey, stood in the way of extending
   benefits to same-sex partners: "the company's current union contract
   specifies that the benefits can only be extended to 'spouses,' but that
   New Jersey's civil unions law doesn't specifically call civil union
   partners 'spouses.'" ^[208][7]

   On [209]July 20, [210]2007, Governor Jon Corzine sent a letter to UPS
   officials on behalf of a UPS driver and her partner, asking the company
   to comply with New Jersey law and extend spousal benefits such as
   health insurance to civil union partners. On [211]July 30, Allen Hill,
   UPS's senior vice president for human resources, announced, "We have
   received clear guidance that, at least in New Jersey, the state truly
   views civil union partners as married. We've heard that loud and clear
   from state officials and we're happy to make this change." ^[212][8]

   The company also noted that it already offers equality of benefits to
   married same-sex couples in [213]Massachusetts, and would review its
   policies in [214]Connecticut and [215]Vermont, which also offer civil
   unions.

[[216]edit] Civil Union Review Commission recommends same-sex marriage

   The commission formed to review whether civil unions have brought
   equality to same sex couples has determined that civil unions have
   failed to provide equal treatment. On December 10, 2008, the Commission
   unanimously released its finding that marriage laws should be made
   gender neutral to ensure equal treatment of same sex couples.^[217][9]

   Governor Corzine has indicated that he would sign a bill to allow same
   sex marriage, if the legislature passed such a measure. ^[218][10]

[[219]edit] Recognition of out-of-state relationships

   On [220]February 16, [221]2007, [222]Stuart Rabner, then the
   [223]Attorney General of New Jersey, issued a Formal Opinion ^[224][2]
   to the state registrar of vital statistics, containing guidelines for
   recognizing same-sex relationships contracted out of state. Those that
   "provide substantially all the rights and benefits of marriage," are to
   be treated as civil unions in New Jersey. The attorney general named
   the following as specific equivalents to New Jersey civil unions:
     * [225]Vermont - civil unions
     * [226]Connecticut - civil unions
     * [227]California - domestic partnerships
     * [228]Great Britain, [229]New Zealand, [230]Iceland, and [231]Sweden
       - government-sanctioned relationships that afford same-sex couples
       "rights and benefits identical to civil marriage"

   In addition, the attorney general stated that same-sex marriages
   contracted in the following jurisdictions are to be treated as New
   Jersey civil unions also:
     * [232]Massachusetts
     * [233]Canada
     * [234]The Netherlands
     * [235]Belgium
     * [236]South Africa
     * [237]Spain

   (Presumably, [238]same-sex marriage in California, as authorized by the
   [239]Marriage Cases ruling after [240]17 June [241]2008, will also be
   treated as civil unions in New Jersey, depending on whether the
   [242]California Supreme Court invalidates those marriages following the
   passage of [243]Proposition 8.)

   However, the attorney general named the following same-sex
   relationships, which "provide notably fewer rights" than marriage, to
   be treated as domestic partnerships under New Jersey law:
     * [244]Maine - domestic partnerships
     * [245]District of Columbia - domestic partnerships
     * [246]Hawaii - reciprocal beneficiary relationships
     * government-sanctioned same-sex relationships in [247]Andorra,
       [248]Columbia, [249]Croatia, [250]Czech Republic, [251]Denmark,
       [252]Finland, [253]France, [254]Germany, [255]Hungary, [256]Israel,
       [257]Luxembourg, [258]Norway, [259]Portugal, [260]Slovenia,
       [261]Switzerland, as well as
     * parts of [262]Argentina, [263]Italy, [264]Brazil, [265]Mexico, and
     * all [266]Australian states.

   The attorney general further stated that other "government-sanctioned
   same-sex relationships offered by foreign nations" besides those named
   in this Formal Opinion "are valid" as either domestic partnerships or
   civil unions in New Jersey, depending on which one they "more closely
   approximate." ^[267][2]

       favored a law legalizing civil unions, with 66% in favor and 29%
       opposed. ^[281][11]

     * A Zogby International Poll, conducted in February 2006 and
       commissioned by Garden State Equality, found 56% of the State
       support a change in the marriage law that would allow same-sex
       couples the right to marry. 39% would oppose the change. By a
       67%-28% margin, New Jersey voters say they oppose the idea of a
       constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, and want the
       legislature to accept the decision of the Supreme Court. By a
       77%-20% margin, New Jersey voters also say the legislature has
       better priorities than to try to amend the constitution to bar gay
       marriage.

     * Another Zogby International poll, conducted in April 2005, also
       commissioned by Garden State Equality, found 54.5% of New Jerseyans
       favored same-sex marriage. 40.1% disagreed, with 5.4% not yet
       having an opinion. When asked if those who were legally married
       outside of the State, 57.5% felt the marriages should be
       recognized, 37.2% thought the State shouldn't recognize them, and
       5.3% weren't sure. ^[282][12]

     * A Rasmussen Reports survey of 500 likely voters, conducted July 25,
       2006, found that 54% of New Jersey voters believe marriage is
       defined as the union of a man and a woman only. 42% of those
       surveyed said that marriage is the union of any two people.
