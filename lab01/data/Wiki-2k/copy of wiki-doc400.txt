   Drew Blyth Barrymore (born February 22, 1975) is an American
   [17]actress and [18]film producer. She is the youngest member of the
   [19]Barrymore family of American actors. She began acting when she was
   eleven months old. Barrymore made her screen debut in [20]Altered
   States in 1980. Afterwards, she starred in her breakout role in
   [21]E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. She quickly became one of
   [22]Hollywood's most recognized child actresses, going on to establish
   herself in mainly comic roles.

   Following a turbulent childhood which was marked by [23]drug and
   [24]alcohol abuse and two stints in [25]rehab,^[26][1]^[27][2]
   Barrymore wrote the 1990 [28]autobiography, Little Girl Lost. Barrymore
   successfully made the transition from child star to adult actress with
   a number of films including the unsuccessful [29]Poison Ivy, [30]Bad
   Girls, [31]Boys on the Side, and [32]Everyone Says I Love You.
   Subsequently, she has established herself in [33]romantic comedies such
   as [34]The Wedding Singer and starred in the [35]drama film [36]Lucky
   You opposite [37]Eric Bana.

   In 1995, she and partner Nancy Juvonen formed the production company
   [38]Flower Films, with its first production the 1999 Barrymore film
   [39]Never Been Kissed. Flower Films has gone on to produce the
   Barrymore vehicle films [40]Charlie's Angels, [41]50 First Dates, and
   [42]Music and Lyrics, as well as the cult film [43]Donnie Darko.
   Barrymore's more recent projects include [44]He's Just Not That into
   You, [45]Beverly Hills Chihuahua, and [46]Everybody's Fine. A recipient
   of a star on the [47]Hollywood Walk of Fame, Barrymore appeared on the
   cover of the 2007 [48]People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful issue.

   Barrymore was named Ambassador Against Hunger for the [49]United
   Nations [50]World Food Programme (WFP). Since then, she has donated
   over [51]$1 million dollars to the program. In 2007, she became both
   [52]CoverGirl's newest model and spokeswoman for the cosmetic and the
   face for [53]Gucci's newest jewelry line.

[[68]edit] Life and career

[[69]edit] Early life

   Barrymore was born in [70]Culver City, [71]California, the daughter of
   American actor [72]John Drew Barrymore and [73]Ildik Jaid Barrymore
   ([74]ne Mak),^[75][1]^[76][3] an aspiring actress born in a
   [77]displaced persons camp in [78]Brannenburg, [79]West Germany to
   [80]Hungarian [81]World War II refugees. She is of [82]Irish descent on
   her father's side through an ancestor, actor [83]Maurice Costello. Her
   parents [84]divorced after she was born.^[85][1] She has a half-brother
   [86]John Blyth Barrymore,^[87][4] also an actor, and two half-sisters,
   Blyth Dolores Barrymore and Brahma (Jessica) Blyth Barrymore.

   Barrymore was born into the acting profession, her great-grandparents
   [88]Maurice Barrymore and [89]Georgie Drew Barrymore, [90]Maurice
   Costello and [91]Mae Costello (ne Altschuk)^[92][5] and her
   grandparents [93]John Barrymore and [94]Dolores Costello were all
   actors;^[95][5] John Barrymore was arguably the most acclaimed actor of
   his generation.^[96][1]^[97][6] She is the grand-niece of [98]Lionel
   Barrymore, [99]Ethel Barrymore and [100]Helene Costello,^[101][7] the
   great-great-granddaughter of [102]John Drew and actress [103]Louisa
   Lane Drew, and the great grandniece of silent film
   actor/writer/director [104]Sidney Drew.^[105][8] She is also the
   god-daughter of director [106]Steven Spielberg.^[107][2]

   Her first name, Drew, was the maiden name of her paternal
   great-grandmother, Georgie Drew Barrymore; her middle name, Blyth, was
   the original surname of the dynasty founded by her great-grandfather,
   Maurice Barrymore.^[108][2]

[[109]edit] Rise to fame

   Drew Barrymore's star on the [110]Hollywood Walk of Fame

   Barrymore's career began when she auditioned for a dog food commercial
   at eleven months old.^[111][2] When she was bitten by her canine
   co-star, the producers were afraid she would cry, but she merely
   laughed, and was hired for the job.^[112][2] She made her film debut in
   [113]Altered States (1980), in which she got a small part.^[114][1] A
   year later, she landed the role of Gertie, the younger sister of
   Elliott, in [115]E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which made her
   famous.^[116][2] She received a [117]Golden Globe nomination for Best
   Supporting Actress in 1984 for her role in [118]Irreconcilable
   Differences, in which she starred as a young girl divorcing her
   parents.^[119][2]^[120][9] In a review in the [121]Chicago Sun-Times,
   [122]Roger Ebert states: "Barrymore is the right actress for this role
   precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm." He concludes
   with saying that "The Drew Barrymore character sees right through all
   of this. She doesn't care about careers, she wants to be given a happy
   home and her minimum daily requirement of love, and, in a way, the
   movie is about how Hollywood (and American success in general) tends to
   cut adults off from the natural functions of parents."^[123][10]

[[124]edit] Rebellious era

   In the wake of this sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously
   troubled childhood. She was already a regular at the famed [125]Studio
   54 when she was a little girl, smoking [126]cigarettes at age nine,
   drinking [127]alcohol by the time she was 11, smoking [128]marijuana at
   12, and snorting [129]cocaine at 13.^[130][1]^[131][2] Her nightlife
   and constant partying became a popular subject with the media.^[132][1]
   She was in rehab at age 13.^[133][1]^[134][2] A suicide attempt at age
   14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three month stay with singer
   [135]David Crosby and his wife.^[136][6] The stay was precipitate,
   Crosby said, because she "needed to be around some people that were
   committed to [137]sobriety."^[138][6] Barrymore later described this
   period of her life in her 1990 [139]autobiography, Little Girl Lost.
   The next year, following a successful juvenile court petition for
   [140]emancipation, she moved into her own apartment and has never
   relapsed.^[141][6]

[[142]edit] New image

   In her late teens, Barrymore forged a new image as she played a
   manipulative teenage seductress in [143]Poison Ivy (1992), which was a
   [144]box office failure, but was popular on [145]video and
   [146]cable.^[147][1]^[148][11] That same year, at the age of 17, she
   posed nude for the cover of the July issue of [149]Interview magazine
   with her then-fiance, actor [150]Jamie Walters, as well as appearing
   nude in pictures inside the issue.^[151][12] In 1993, Barrymore earned
   a second [152]Golden Globe nomination for the film
   [153]Guncrazy.^[154][9] Barrymore would go on to pose nude for the
   January 1995 issue of [155]Playboy.^[156][13]^[157][14] [158]Steven
   Spielberg, who directed her in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial when she was
   a child, gave her a [159]quilt for her twentieth birthday with a note
   that read, "Cover yourself up".^[160][2] Enclosed were copies of her
   Playboy pictures, with the pictures altered by his art department so
   that she appeared fully clothed.^[161][15] She would appear nude in
   five of her films during this period. During a 1995 appearance on the
   [162]Late Show with David Letterman, Barrymore climbed onto [163]Dave
   Letterman's desk and bared her breasts to him, her back to the camera,
   in celebration of his birthday.^[164][6] She modeled in a series of
   [165]Guess? jeans ads during this time.^[166][16] She underwent breast
   reduction surgery in 1992, and has said on the subject:
   I really love my body and the way it is right now. There's something
   very awkward about women and their breasts because men look at them so
   much. When they're huge, you become very self-conscious. Your back
   hurts. You find that whatever you wear, you look heavy in. It's
   uncomfortable. I've learned something, though, about breasts through my
   years of pondering and pontificating, and that is: Men love them, and I
   love that.^[167][17]

[[168]edit] Return to prominence

   In 1995, Barrymore starred in [169]Boys on the Side opposite
   [170]Whoopi Goldberg and [171]Mary-Louise Parker,^[172][18] and had a
   [173]cameo role in [174]Joel Schumacher's film [175]Batman Forever, in
   which she portrayed a glitzy [176]Marilyn Monroe
   character.^[177][19]^[178][20] The following year, she made a cameo in
   the successful [179]horror film [180]Scream. Barrymore has continued to
   be highly bankable, and a top box office draw.^[181][1]^[182][21] She
   was frequently cast in [183]romantic comedies, such as Wishful Thinking
   (1996), [184]The Wedding Singer (1998),^[185][22] [186]Home Fries
   (1998).^[187][23]

   Besides a number of appearances in films produced by her company,
   [188]Flower Films, including [189]Charlie's Angels, Barrymore had a
   dramatic role in the comedy/drama [190]Riding in Cars with Boys (2001),
   playing a teenage mother in a failed marriage with the drug-addicted
   father (based on the real-life story of [191]Beverly
   D'Onofrio).^[192][24] In 2002, Barrymore appeared in [193]Confessions
   of a Dangerous Mind, alongside [194]Julia Roberts.^[195][25]

[[196]edit] Flower Films

   In 1995, Barrymore formed [197]Flower Films, a production company, with
   business partner Nancy Juvonen.^[198][26] The first film produced by
   the company was 1999's [199]Never Been Kissed.^[200][27] The second
   offering from the company was [201]Charlie's Angels (2000), a major box
   office success of 2000 that helped solidify the standing of both
   Barrymore and the company.^[202][2]^[203][28]

   When the production of [204]Richard Kelly's debut film, [205]Donnie
   Darko, was threatened, Barrymore stepped forward with financing from
   Flower Films and took the small role of Karen Pomeroy, the title
   character's English teacher.^[206][29] Although the film was less than
   successful at the box office in the wake of [207]9/11, it reached cult
   film status after the DVD release, inspiring numerous websites devoted
   to unraveling the plot twists and meanings.^[208][29]

   In 2003, she reprised her role as Dylan Sanders in [209]Charlie's
   Angels: Full Throttle,^[210][1]^[211][28] was nominated for an
   [212]Emmy Award for her performance in [213]Olive, the Other
   Reindeer^[214][30] and appeared with [215]Ben Stiller in [216]Duplex in
   2003. Flower Films produced [217]50 First Dates with co-star [218]Adam
   Sandler's [219]Happy Madison company in 2004.^[220][31]^[221][32]
   Summing up Barrymore's appeal, [222]Roger Ebert, in his review of
   [223]50 First Dates, described Barrymore as having a "smiling, coy
   sincerity", describing the film as "ingratiating and
   lovable".^[224][33]

   50 First Dates was followed by [225]Fever Pitch (2005), and in 2007,
   [226]Music and Lyrics and [227]Lucky You.^[228][34]^[229][35]
   Barrymore's more recent projects include [230]Beverly Hills Chihuahua
   and [231]Grey Gardens in 2008, and 2009's [232]He's Just Not That into
   You and [233]Everybody's Fine.

[[234]edit] Other career highlights

   One of her more recent roles has involved her becoming a recurring
   character in the animated comedy [235]Family Guy as [236]Brian
   Griffin's simple-minded girlfriend, Jillian.^[237][36] She has since
   appeared in four episodes.^[238][36]^[239][37]^[240][38]^[241][39] She
   was the subject of the 2005 documentary [242]My Date with Drew. In it,
   an aspiring filmmaker and a fan of Barrymore's, uses his limited
   resources in an attempt to gain a date with her.^[243][40]

   On February 3, 2004, she received a star on the [244]Hollywood Walk of
   Fame.^[245][41]
   [246]Josette Sheeran Shiner, Barrymore, [247]Condoleezza Rice, and

   for the fifth time,^[253][28] making her the second female host in the
   show's history to do so ([254]Candice Bergen being the first), and she
   still remains the youngest celebrity to host the show (Barrymore hosted
   in 1982 at age seven).^[255][43]^[256][44]

   Barrymore became a [257]CoverGirl Cosmetics' model and spokeswoman in
   2007,^[258][45] and was No. 1 in [259]People's annual 100 Most

   In May 2007, Barrymore was named Ambassador Against Hunger for the
   United Nations [266]World Food Programme^[267][49]^[268][50] and later
   donated $1 million to the cause.^[269][28]^[270][51]

[[271]edit] Personal life

   Barrymore was engaged and lived with musician/actor [272]Jamie Walters
   for a period in 1992-93.^[273][52]

   Barrymore was married to Welsh bartender turned bar owner Jeremy Thomas
   from March 20 to April 28, 1994.^[274][1]^[275][6] Her second marriage
   was to comedian [276]Tom Green from July 7, 2001 to October 15,
   2002.^[277][53]^[278][54] Green filed for divorce in December
   2001.^[279][54] In 2002, Barrymore began dating [280]Strokes' drummer
   [281]Fabrizio Moretti, soon after they met at a
   concert.^[282][1]^[283][28] Their five year relationship, however,
   ended on January 10, 2007.^[284][28]^[285][55] She most recently dated
   [286]Justin Long,^[287][56] however, they confirmed their split in July
   2008.^[288][57]

   In March 2007, former magazine editor [289]Jane Pratt claimed on her
   [290]Sirius Satellite Radio show that she had a romance with Barrymore
   in the mid-nineties.^[291][58] This was after Barrymore's own 2004
   admission that she considered herself [292]bisexual, commenting: "A
   woman and a woman together are beautiful, just as a man and a woman
   together are beautiful. Being with a woman is like exploring your own
   body, but through someone else. When I was younger I used to go with
   lots of women. Totally. I love it".^[293][59]

   Barrymore was formerly a [294]vegetarian, but has since begun to eat
   meat.^[295][60]
