   Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and 1st Duke of
   Newcastle-under-Lyne, [27]KG, [28]PC (21 July 1693 17 November 1768)
   was a [29]British [30]Whig [31]statesman, whose official life extended
   throughout the Whig supremacy of the 18th century. He is commonly known
   as the Duke of Newcastle.

   A protege of [32]Sir Robert Walpole, he served under him for more than
   twenty years until 1742. He held power with his brother, [33]Henry
   Pelham (the [34]Prime Minister of Great Britain), until 1754. He had at
   this point served as a [35]Secretary of State continuously for thirty
   years.

   After Henry's death, the Duke would hold his late brother's position
   for six years (in two separate periods). While his premiership was not
   particularly notable, Newcastle precipitated the [36]Seven Years War,
   which would cause his resignation from his high position. After his
   second term as Prime Minister, he served for a short while in [37]Lord
   Rockingham's government, before retiring from government.

[[70]edit] Biography

[[71]edit] Early life

   Thomas Pelham was born in London on 21 July 1693^[72][1] the eldest son
   of the [73]1st Baron Pelham, by his second wife, the former Lady Grace
   Holles, younger sister of the [74]1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He
   studied at [75]Westminster School and was admitted a fellow-commoner at
   [76]Clare College, Cambridge in 1710.^[77][2] His uncle died in 1711,
   and his father the next year, both leaving their large estates to him.
   When he came of age in 1714, Lord Pelham was one of the greatest
   landowners in the kingdom, enjoying enormous patronage in the county of
   [78]Sussex. One stipulation of his uncle in his inheritance, was that
   he add Holles to his name, which he faithfully did - thereafter styling
   himself as Thomas Pelham-Holles.^[79][3]

   He increasingly identified with [80]Whig politics, like his father and
   uncle - but whereas they had been moderate in their views, he grew
   increasingly more partisan and militant in his views.^[81][4] Britain
   at the time was very divided between Whigs who favoured the future
   succession of [82]George I and [83]Tories who supported the return of
   the Jacobite [84]James III, known later as the 'old pretender'. This
   issue dominated British politics during the last few years of Queen
   Anne's reign, leading up to her death in 1714 - and had a profound
   impact on the future career of the young Duke of Newcastle. He joined
   the [85]Hannover Club and the [86]Kit Kat Club, both leading centres of
   Whig thinking and organisation. [87]Newcastle House in London became
   his premier residence.

[[88]edit] Early political career

   From 1720 Newcastle allied himself with [89]Sir Robert Walpole. They
   would be political partners for the next twenty years, and Newcastle
   would remain a loyalist until Walpole's fall in 1742.

   Newcastle vigorously sustained the Whigs at [90]Queen Anne's death, and
   had much influence in making the Londoners accept [91]King George I,
   even organising so-called 'Newcastle mobs' to fight with rival
   [92]Jacobites in the street.^[93][5]

   His services were too great to be neglected by the new Hanoverian King,
   and in 1714 he was created Earl of Clare, and in 1715 Duke of
   Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He also became [94]Lord-Lieutenant of the Counties
   of [95]Middlesex and [96]Nottingham and a [97]Knight of the Garter. In
   his new position he was in charge of suppressing Jacobitism in the
   counties under his control. In Middlesex he arrested and questioned
   eight hundred people, and then drew up a Voluntary Defence Association
   to defend the county. During 1715 he became involved in a riot that
   ended with two men being killed, and Newcastle fleeing along
   rooftops.^[98][6] The succession of [99]George I and the was secured in
   late 1715 by the defeat of a Jacobite army at the [100]Battle of
   Preston and the subsequent flight of the [101]Old Pretender.^[102][7]

   The victory of the Hanoverians over the Jacobites, marked the beginning
   of the [103]Whig Ascendancy which lasted for much of the eighteenth
   century. Because the Tory opposition had been tainted, in the eyes of
   George I, by their support of the Jacobite pretenders, he did not trust
   them, and drew all his ministers and officials from the Whig faction.
   Following their victory, the Whigs split with one group forming the
   government for George I, while the other dissident Whigs became the
   effective opposition in Parliament. After a period of political
   manoeuvring, during which time he was for a while associated with a
   Whig faction led by [104]James Stanhope, from 1720 Newcastle began to
   identify strongly with the Government Whigs - who had quickly come to
   be dominated by [105]Sir Robert Walpole.^[106][8]

   Walpole gladly welcomed the young Newcastle into his coterie, because
   he believed he could easily control him - and it would strengthen his
   hand against the rival Whig factions.^[107][9] Newcastle joined with
   Walpole because he, correctly, believed that he was going to dominate
   British politics for a generation. From 1721 Walpole began to serve as
   Britain's first official [108]Prime Minister, a position he would hold
   for the next twenty one years. He was related to Walpole's leading ally
   [109]Charles Townshend, strengthening his bond with the leader of the
   new administration.

   On 2 April 1717 he increased his Whig connections by marrying [110]Lady
   Henrietta Godolphin the granddaughter of the [111]Duke of Marlborough,
   a national hero following his victories in the recent [112]European war
   and considered a Whig icon.^[113][10]

[[114]edit] Lord Chamberlain

          Further information: [115]Lord Chamberlain

   In 1717, at the age of twenty three, Newcastle first attained high
   political office as [116]Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and was
   given the responsibility of overseeing theatres.^[117][11] Plays at the
   time were often extremely political, and Newcastle was tasked with
   suppressing any plays or playwrights believed to be too critical of the
   Hanoverian succession or the Whig government. During this time
   Newcastle clashed repeatedly with a leading playwright [118]Sir Richard
   Steele. ^[119][12]
   [120]Newcastle House which he inherited from his uncle in 1711, and
   used as his primary London residence, often throwing lavish parties
   there.

   He held the post for seven years, and performed well enough to be
   considered for further promotion. Despite his youth, he had
   demonstrated his strength in several [121]general elections when he had
   been able to get as many as twenty MPs elected to seats he controlled
   through his family's wealth and political patronage. He survived in the
   office during the turmoil in the Whig party between 1717 and 1721 and
   his switch of allegiance to Walpole secured his position thereafter.
   Walpole had overseen a brief end to the rift between the Whig factions,
   following the collapse of the [122]South Sea Company which had left
   thousands ruined. Newcastle himself had lost 4,000 he had invested when
   the [123]South Sea Bubble was at its height.^[124][13] Following this
   Walpole was seen as the only man to steady both the country and the
   Whig Party, and was granted unprecedented powers, effectively making
   him the first [125]Prime Minister of Great Britain.

   During his time in the office, Newcastle and his wife had become famous
   for throwing lavish parties, which were attended by much of London
   society including many of his political opponents. He was also
   prodigiously fond of [126]hunting and often went down to
   [127]Bishopstone, one of his Sussex properties, expressly for this
   purpose.^[128][14] During his time as Lord Chamberlain he oversaw a
   major overhaul of public buildings, many of which had fallen into very
   poor repair.^[129][15]

[[130]edit] Secretary of State

          Main article: [131]The Newcastle System

[[132]edit] Appointment

   In 1724 Newcastle was chosen by [133]Sir Robert Walpole to be
   [134]Secretary of State for the Southern Department in place of
   [135]Lord Carteret, a move largely engineered by Townshend. He had been
   for some time considered the third most important man in the government
   behind Walpole and Townshend, and his new position confirmed this.
   Newcastle had for several years been growing increasingly interested in
   Foreign Affairs, and had been educating himself on the subtle
   ins-and-outs of [136]diplomacy and the [137]European State System. In
   spite of this, for the first few years in this office he deferred
   control of British foreign policy to the other Secretary of State,
   Townshend, and effectively served as his deputy. Walpole too was
   generally happy to allow Townshend to control foreign affairs, as he
   agreed with him on most issues.

[[138]edit] The French Alliance

          Further information: [139]Anglo-French Alliance

   Since the [140]Treaty of Utrecht which had ended the [141]last major
   European war, Britain had been an ally of [142]France - a strong
   reversal in policy, as France had previously been considered the
   premier enemy of Britain.^[143][16] The reasons for the alliance were
   complex, and many had doubted the detente could last long, but by the
   time Newcastle became Secretary of State they had been allies for
   nearly a decade. By 1719 they had become part of a wider Quadruple
   Alliance, which was overwhelmingly the most powerful force in European
   politics. This had been demonstrated during the [144]War of the
   Quadruple Alliance, a largely naval war in the Mediterranean by which
   the powers had defeated a Spanish attempt to reclaim lost territory in
   [145]Italy.^[146][17] The alliance was unpopular, however, with many in
   parliament and in the country who continued to consider France
   Britain's natural enemy.
   Newcastle in 1735 when he was [147]Southern Secretary in the
   [148]Walpole Government

   Newcastle had been joined in government by his young brother [149]Henry
   Pelham. The two brothers got on well, although they were prone to have
   intractable disputes. One constant source of tension between them was
   Newcastle's poor handling of the family fortune, which was being
   constantly depleted through his out of control spending. Pelham was
   also considered by many to be the abler of the two brothers, but it was
   the Duke who had got initially further in politics. In spite of their
   differences, they remained firm political allies.

[[150]edit] Domestic crisis

   The Administration faced a crisis in 1727 when [151]George I died
   unexpectedly and his son [152]George II succeeded to the
   throne.^[153][18] The new King had previously had exceptionally bad
   relations with Walpole and Newcastle and during one altercation between
   them George's poor English had made Newcastle think he had challenged
   him to a duel.^[154][19] Their relationship had not improved in recent
   years, and many anticipated the imminent replacement of the government.
   Instead Walpole made himself extremely useful to George II, who soon
   became convinced of his competence and retained him in his post. The
   thawing of relations was helped by the friendship between Newcastle and
   George's daughter [155]Amelia leading many to speculate, without
   substantive evidence, that they were having an affair.^[156][20] By
   November 1727 Walpole and Newcastle's positions were both safe once
   more, boosted by an election victory which saw them gain 430 seats to
   the opposition's 128 in the [157]House of Commons.^[158][21]

   In 1729 a rift broke out in the government over the direction of
   Britain's foreign policy. Townshend was convinced that Britain's
   principal enemy was now [159]Austria.^[160][22] Walpole and Newcastle
   saw Spain as the main threat to British power, because of their large
   navy and colonial interests. Eventually Walpole had his way, forcing
   Townshend from office, and replacing him with [161]Lord Harrington.
   From then on Newcastle served as the senior Secretary of State, and
   largely controlled British foreign policy himself. Newcastle was
   saddened by the demise of his relative and former patron, although
   their partnership had become increasingly strained and the new
   situation offered enormous possibilities to him personally.^[162][23]

[[163]edit] Peace policy

   Together Newcastle and Walpole managed to drive a wedge between Spain
   and Austria, making an ally of the latter, and directing their future
   efforts against Spain. Subsequently, however, it turned out that
   Britain's long-term major rival was neither of the two but France,
   which had been considered a close ally up to that point. The
   increasingly confrontational actions of the French Prime Minister
   [164]Cardinal Fleury soon convinced them that they had been
   wrong.^[165][24] This misjudgement was later used by the [166]Patriot
   Whigs to castigate the Ministry for their lack of preparation against
   the French threat.
   [167]King George II who reigned from 1727 to 1760. Despite their
   initial violent hatred of each other, he and Newcastle grew to have a
   very productive relationship which lasted for over three decades.

   In general, Newcastle shared Walpole's abhorrence of war, and wished to
   prevent Britain getting dragged in to major wars on the continent.
   Notably Britain did not become embroiled in the [168]War of the Polish
   Succession, and indeed tried to prevent it from breaking out. Newcastle
   attempted to throw both the French and Austrians off-guard by being
   cagey about Britain's response should any war break out, but this did
   not stop the conflict.^[169][25] Once the war had started, George II
   tried to push for Britain to honour its commitment to assist Austria,
   but he was blocked by Walpole who insisted Britain should not join the
   war. Newcastle broadly supported the same position as the King, but he
   accepted the decision.^[170][26]

   By this stage Newcastle's brother [171]Henry Pelham had attained the
   lucrative position of [172]Paymaster General, and had effectively
   replaced Townshend as the third man of the government. The three men
   continued what had become dubbed as the [173]Norfolk Congress by
   meeting regularly at [174]Houghton Hall, Sir Robert Walpole's
   [175]country house in [176]Norfolk. The three men would hold private
   meetings, draw up wide-ranging policies on foreign and domestic issues,
   and then present them to parliament for their seal of approval, which
   their vast majority allowed them to do. Slowly, however, Newcastle and
   his brother were moving out of the shadow of Walpole, and being more
   assertive. Newcastle was particularly annoyed by what he saw as the
   abandonment of Austria, and by the suggestion that Walpole no longer
   trusted him.^[177][27]

   By 1735 Newcastle had largely assumed control of colonial affairs,
   further increasing the amount of patronage he controlled. A devout
   [178]Anglican, he was also given control over [179]ecclesiastical
   matters. His growing independence from Walpole, was helped by the
   support of his brother and his best friend, [180]Hardwicke, who had
   become Lord Chancellor.^[181][28] During the latter half of the decade
   his job was increasingly dominated by managing relations with Spain,
   which included trade disputes and objections the controversial founding
   of the British colony of [182]Georgia in 1733. Because of this the
   long-standing peace policy was beginning to look extremely fragile. He
   also acted as a mediator in the [183]War of the Polish Succession,
   helping to bring the conflict to an end in 1738.

[[184]edit] Jenkin's Ear and Spanish America

          Main article: [185]War of Jenkin's Ear

   The growing tension between Britain and Spain came to a head in 1731
   during an incident known as [186]Jenkin's Ear, when a British merchant
   captain was captured for illegal trading off the coast of [187]Cuba by
   the Spanish navy, and in punishment for his alleged breach of the
   strict laws forbidding foreign commerce with Spanish colonies, he had
   an ear cut off.^[188][29] The incident shocked Britain, not so much
   because of its brutality, but because many saw it as an outrage that
   Spain should have the temerity to harm a British subject simply for
   trading - which many held to be a legitimate occupation.^[189][30]

   In 1739 Jenkins appeared in parliament to testify about his treatment.
   Other merchants sent petitions, and the powerful [190]South Sea Company
   mobilised popular opinion. To many the [191]Spanish Empire was
   crumbling, and its South American possessions were ripe for the
   picking. A vociferous group in parliament demanded war with Spain.
   Walpole was adamantly opposed to such a policy, and became a target for
   unprecedented attacks.^[192][31] Newcastle too came under intense
   pressure, though he initially considered the demands that Britain
   declare war with Spain a dangerous step and in spite of his
   increasingly bellicose statements, he still considered the idea of an
   Anglo-Spanish alliance as late as 1739. He tried to negotiate a
   solution to the crisis with the [193]Convention of Pardo, which agreed
   a sum of compensation to be paid to British merchants^[194][32] but
   British public opinion had shifted and Walpole felt that there was no
   option but to declare war in December 1739.
   Newcastle enjoyed a close but at times strained relationship with his
   brother [195]Henry Pelham. The two men formed a formidable political
   partnership following the fall of Walpole, and together dominated
   British politics until Henry's death in 1754.

   The British opened the war with a victory, capturing [196]Porto Bello
   in [197]Panama. This led to an outbreak of patriotic fervour, and
   further increased the pressure on Walpole and Newcastle for their
   perceived unwilling prosecution of the war.^[198][33] Newcastle tried
   to combat this by cultivating a reputation as the leading "patriot" of
   the cabinet. He took on additional military responsibilities and, for
   the first two years of war, served as a de facto Minister of
   War.^[199][34] One of his most notable suggestions during the period
   was the recruitment of large numbers of troops drawn from the
   [200]American colonies, whose growing manpower had previously gone
   largely untapped.

   In 1741 the main British campaign against Spain was a combined
   amphibious attack on the South American city of [201]Cartagena, which
   had experienced considerable delays. Command was awarded to
   [202]Admiral Edward Vernon, the victor of Porto Bello, who was given a
   force of 31,000 soldiers and sailors to take the city. [203]The siege
   proved to be a total disaster for the British, who lost thousands of
   men before being forced to withdraw. Although Newcastle had issued the
   orders, and had overseen the organisation of the expedition, much of
   the blame for the disaster fell on the shoulders of the ailing Prime
   Minister, Sir Robert Walpole.

[[204]edit] Fall of Walpole

          Main article: [205]Sir Robert Walpole

   In the wake of the Cartagena disaster, Britain held a general election.
   The result reduced Walpole's former dominance of the House to a now
   unworkable majority. Within months he had been forced out of office,
   and succeeded by [206]Lord Wilmington. Though he stayed with Walpole to
   the end, Newcastle was later accused by many of Walpole's supporters of
   undermining him.^[207][35] [208]Horace Walpole, his son, continued to
   attack his behaviour for years to come.

   Newcastle continued in office after Walpole's fall and became more
   powerful on his younger brother becoming Prime Minister in 1743.
   Together the two brothers and their supporters known as the 'Old Whigs'
   made a coalition with the 'New Whigs', previous opponents of the
   Walpole government. In spite of this there remained a strident
   opposition, led vocally by men like [209]William Pitt and [210]Lord
   Sandwich.^[211][36]

[[212]edit] War of the Austrian Succession

          Main article: [213]War of the Austrian Succession

   Newcastle was a strong supporter of [214]Austria, and advocated aid to
   the country during the [215]War of the Austrian Succession. After the
   war he built his system for retaining peace around the alliance with
   Austria, only for it to collapse spectacularly in 1756.

   In 1740 a short while after the declaration of war with Spain, a
   separate war had broken out simultaneously in Europe, into which the
   [216]War of Jenkins' Ear soon became submerged. In a dispute over the
   throne of the [217]Austrian Empire, France and Prussia had invaded
   Austria, planning to remove [218]Empress Maria Theresa and replace her
   with their own claimant. Austria's long-standing alliance with Britain
   required them to declare war. It was also considered by many that a
   French victory would leave them too strong in Europe. Because of this,
   Britain soon found itself dragged into this wider war despite the
   reluctance of the government.

   Initially Britain's involvement was limited to financial subsidies and
   diplomacy in support of Austria, By 1742 it was apparent that a more
   substantial commitment would be needed, if the alliance wasn't to end
   in defeat. The same year 16,000 British troops were sent to the
   continent. Newcastle was a staunch [219]Austrophile^[220][37] and
   strongly supported aid to the Austrians. He had long conceived the only
   way Britain could defeat France was in alliance with Austria, a view
   sharply at odds with many other leading thinkers of the era, including
   Walpole and Pitt.

   Newcastle's position had briefly been threatened by [221]Carteret, a
   royal favourite, but by 1743 he and his brother were firmly in control
   of British policy - a position that would last until 1756. He now set
   about drawing up a fresh scheme to enhance British power on the
   continent. This included an attempt to persuade the [222]Dutch Republic
   into the anti-French alliance, and mediating the dispute between
   Austria and Prussia that led to the [223]Treaty of Dresden in 1745. He
   also approved plans for [224]a colonial raid against Louisbourg in
   1745, which was successful.

[[225]edit] Jacobite Rising

          Main article: [226]Jacobite Rising

   In 1745 the Jacobite Rising broke out in [227]Scotland, and had soon
   spread to [228]northern England. Newcastle feared both an attack from
   the north by [229]Bonnie Prince Charlie who had gathered 5,000 men in
   [230]Derby and a French invasion of southern England. In the panic a
   number of false rumours circulated around London, including news that
   Newcastle had fled to the continent fearing all was lost. He was forced
   to show himself to a crowd that had gathered outside [231]Newcastle
   House, to prove he was still there.^[232][38] Nonetheless his position
   was threatened, if the Jacobites were triumphant his estates would
   likely have been confiscated and he would have been forced into exile.

   Newcastle awoke to the threat posed by the Jacobites, much faster than
   George II or many of his colleagues who dismissed the rebellion as a
   farce, and organised a response. By late 1745 he had rallied all the
   southern militias and regular forces, and the Jacobites withdrew to
   northern Scotland where they were defeat at [233]Culloden in 1746.

[[234]edit] Peace of Aix-La-Chapelle

          Main article: [235]Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)

   On the [236]Continent the British continued the war effort, but they
   were now under pressure from the [237]Dutch Republic to make peace with
   the French. The Dutch feared that the French were about launch a
   devastating onslaught to overrun their country. Newcastle considered
   that any peace that would be made at that time would be extremely
   disadvantageous to Britain, and he tried to keep the anti-French
   coalition strong through constant diplomacy and offers of
   [238]financial subsidies.

   Talks for a peace settlement were convened in the city of [239]Breda in
   1746. Newcastle was instrumental in securing the appointment of
   [240]Lord Sandwich as the British representative at the talks, as his
   views were very close to his own.^[241][39] Sandwich's instructions
   were principally to delay the talks, until a significant British
   victory allowed them to negotiate from a position of strength. The
   [242]Congress of Breda did not progress well initially, because the
   participants were not yet fully committed to peace. The Allies
   continued to do badly, suffering severe defeats at [243]Bergen op Zoom
   and [244]Lauffeld. Newcastle's brother, Henry, was now strongly
   advocating peace, but Newcastle firmly rejected this - still convinced
   a major Allied victory was imminent.

   In 1747 Newcastle was involved in organising a coup to put the
   [245]Prince of Orange in power in the Netherlands. Orange was more
   hard-line and wanted to continue the war with the French. However he
   soon had to apply to the British for a massive loan^[246][40], and
   Newcastle became aware how close the Dutch were to collapsing
   altogether. He reluctantly turned towards seeking a peace accommodation
   with France. He berated himself for his "ignorance, obstanacy and
   credulity" and half expected his misjudgement in putting so much faith
   in the Dutch to result in his dismissal^[247][41], but both the King
   and the rest of the cabinet retained their faith in him.

   To better oversee the peace settlement, Newcastle switched across to
   the position of [248]Northern Secretary. He secured Sandwich's
   promotion to [249]the Admiralty although he had wanted him to succeed
   him as [250]Southern Secretary.^[251][42] During the summer of 1748
   Newcastle made his first ever trip outside Britain when he visited
   [252]Hanover, and was received with a rapturous reception wherever he
   went.^[253][43] When the talks got under way they went far more
   smoothly and in October 1748 the [254]Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was
   formally concluded. Britain would give back [255]Louisbourg to France
   in exchange for the return of [256]Madras and a full French withdrawal
   from the Low Countries. The issue of free trade for which Britain had
   gone to war with Spain in 1739 was not mentioned at all.^[257][44]

   Newcastle was immediately attacked by his opponents for giving up
   [258]Louisbourg, but many of them failed to realise just how weak the
   British position on the Continent had become.^[259][45] Austria was
   also deeply unhappy as they felt the British had abandoned them, and
   hadn't pushed hard enough for [260]Silesia to be returned to
   them.^[261][46] Nonetheless Newcastle was happy with the terms that had
   been gained, and observers on the continent were full of praise about
   the way he had overturned so apparently a disadvantageous situation.

[[262]edit] Newcastle's System

          Further information: [263]Anglo-Austrian Alliance

   Following the peace, Newcastle began to put in practice a policy he had
   been developing for a very long time. He believed that the [264]stately
   quadrille, which had seen states continually shifting alliances, had
   been unstable and led to repeated wars. He instead wanted to use
   vigorous diplomacy to create a lasting peace, built around a strong and
   stable British alliance with Austria. Like many Whigs he saw
   maintaining the [265]European Balance of Power as essential. He
   described this process as 'restoring the [266]Old System', but it was
   popularly known as the [267]Newcastle System.

   He came under continuous attack from Pitt and the [268]Patriot Whigs
   who despised his European policy, pointing to their belief that the
   previous war had shown that increasingly North America was the most
   important theatre of war. They mocked Newcastle for his perceived lack
   of vision, ignoring the complex nature of European politics and
   Britain's relationship with Hanover and the fact that as early as 1740
   Newcastle had been aware of the expanding power of the [269]American
   colonies.

   Newcastle remained extremely attentive to the Austrian Alliance. He
   spent several years trying to secure the election of [270]Maria
   Theresa's son, the future Emperor [271]Joseph II, as [272]King of the
   Romans, a titular title of the [273]Holy Roman Empire that carried
   enormous prestige but little real power - only to see this scheme fail
   because of Austrian indifference. During these years there were a
   number of warning signs that all was not well with the alliance, but
   Newcastle ignored most of them - convinced that neither Austria or
   Britain had any other serious potential allies to turn to. His triumphs
   at the [274]Congress of Hanover was undermined by his failure to secure
   Austrian backing.

   During these years he managed to successfully outmanoeuvre the
   [275]Duke of Bedford, engineering his resignation and the dismissal of
   [276]Lord Sandwich who Newcastle had now begun to consider a dangerous
   opponent. The ease with which he did this demonstrated his total
   control of British politics, as Bedford led a strong faction.

   In 1752 he made a rare trip abroad, accompanying George II on his
   annual trip to [277]Hanover. During the visit, Newcastle made an
   attempt to cultivate [278]Lord North, a future Prime Minister, as an
   ally into his political faction.^[279][47] He was unsuccessful although
   the two became good friends, and North later spoke out in defence of
   Newcastle.

   On [280]Henry Pelham's death in 6 March 1754, Newcastle succeeded him
   as Prime Minister. He had initially hoped to stay in his role as
   [281]Northern Secretary as he much preferred foreign affairs, but he
   was persuaded there was no other serious candidate and accepted the
   seals of office from the King in March.^[282][48]

[[283]edit] Prime Minister - first term

   Newcastle's first task was to pick someone [284]to represent the
   government in the Commons. To great surprise he rejected the favourites
   [285]William Pitt and [286]Henry Fox, and chose [287]Sir Thomas
   Robinson - who had barely even been considered a candidate by
   most.^[288][49] Newcastle was largely instrumental in appointing men
   considered slightly weaker, so that he could dominate them. Both Pitt
   and Fox bore a grudge over this percieved slight, and stepped up their
   attacks on the Ministry.

   During 1754 Newcastle oversaw a general election, largely adopting the
   electoral strategy drawn up by his brother, and winning a large
   majority. His own personal ability to have MPs elected on his slate
   reached new heights.^[289][50] He now felt emboldened enough to try and
   push through some financial reforms. He proposed measures to reduce the
   amount of interest paid to the [290]Bank of England on the
   [291]National Debt. His decision to do so may partly have been to
   deflect criticism that he was not sufficiently qualified on financial
   matters to control the Treasury.^[292][51] At the same time he was
   still largely directing foreign policy.

[[293]edit] America

          Further information: [294]French and Indian War

   The rivalry between Britain and France in North America had been
   growing for some time. Both coveted the [295]Ohio Country which offered
   enormous potential for a new wealthy colony to be founded. Both nations
   sent military forces to occupy the territory. While the British set up
   the first initial post, they were [296]driven out by a French
   expedition in 1754. Many wealthy Americans agitated for military
   action, but the preparations of the individual colonies for conflict
   were poor. There was pressure in London too from [297]Patriot Whigs who
   felt the time was ripe for [298]British America to expand into the
   interior.

   For 1755 a [299]major expedition was planned against the French in
   America. A force of British regulars would be sent to seize Ohio, while
   another of [300]New England provincials would take control of [301]Nova
   Scotia. A new [302]Commander in Chief [303]Edward Braddock would be
   appointed to oversee this, taking over from the fractious efforts of
   the colonial assemblies. The architect of this scheme was the [304]Duke
   of Cumberland, who held enormous political sway at the time. Braddock
   was a favourite of his, though Newcastle had his doubts about both
   Braddock and the plans. Newcastle had temporary made an alliance with
   [305]Henry Fox, who he also disliked. Fox was a strong supporter of the
   campaign, forcing Newcastle's hand.

   A few months after arriving in America, Braddock's force were engulfed
   by disaster. [306]Attacked by a mixed force of French and American
   Natives in the wilderness, more than half were killed, including
   Braddock. The remainder retreated back to [307]Philadelphia, leaving
   the French in full control of the interior.^[308][52] The Nova Scotia
   scheme had been more successful, but the [309]Great Expulsion that had
   followed in its wake had created a large amount of problem for
   Newcastle.

   All these events had taken place without war being formally declared.
   With the decline in the American situation, Newcastle was forced to
   abandon his plans for financial reform, as the money would instead need
   to be spent on military forces.

[[310]edit] Seven Years War

          Main article: [311]Seven Years War

   [312]William Pitt was the leader of the [313]Patriot Whigs, and a
   constant thorn in Newcastle's side. Many were surprised when the two
   formed an electoral partnership in 1757.

   While Newcastle had been paying attention to the American campaign,
   more pressing events in Europe demanded his attention. Austria had been
   growing increasingly wary, feeding into a long-standing belief that the
   British would abandon them when it came to crucial moments.^[314][53]
   Newcastle's worst fears were confirmed in 1756 when Austria concluded
   an alliance with France, [315]suddenly throwing the whole balance of
   power in Europe askew.

   Newcastle had hoped to prevent the outbreak of a major war in Europe by
   encircling France with hostile powers. He believed this would both
   deter them from attacking their neighbours and from sending
   reinforcements to [316]North America.^[317][54] He thought that the
   only way war could happen now was if [318]Frederick the Great
   unilaterally attacked Austria which, given the clear disparity in
   numbers, he would be a "madman" to do.^[319][55] Newcastle hoped he had
   managed to avert war in Europe, but in 1756 Frederick invaded
   [320]Silesia triggering the major European war Newcastle had feared and
   failed to prevent. What had begun as a limited war in the [321]Ohio
   country between Britain and France now took on global proportions.

   Newcastle was widely blamed for Britain's poor start to the Seven Years
   War and in November 1756 he was replaced by the [322]Duke of
   Devonshire. Some had even called for his execution following the
   [323]loss of Minorca in 1756.^[324][56] Instead the commander of the
   British fleet [325]John Byng was shot after a court-martial, which many
   considered a [326]smokescreen to protect Newcastle.

   For his long services he was created Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, with
   remainder to the [327]9th Earl of Lincoln, who had married his niece
   Catherine Pelham.

[[328]edit] Prime Minister - second term

[[329]edit] Return

   In July 1757 he again became Prime Minister for [330]Pitt, though a
   great statesman, was a poor leader of the Whig faction on the
   understanding, according to [331]Horace Walpole that "Mr. Pitt does
   everything, the Duke gives everything.". It is often incorrectly stated
   that Pitt was Prime Minister during the war, when in fact it was
   Newcastle who held the office. Their relationship grew into a fruitful
   partnership, and provided a determined leadership that some felt had
   been lacking for some time.
   1759 became known as the '[332]Annus Mirablis' after Britain enjoyed
   victories on several continents as well as at sea. In November a French
   fleet [333]planning to invade England was defeat at [334]Quiberon. Much
   of the credit went to Pitt rather than Newcastle

   On paper it was an implausible alliance.^[335][57] Pitt had been a
   strident critic of Newcastle for years, and they had separate,
   conflicting visions of strategy. Newcastle's saw Britain's best chance
   of victory by directing resources to the war on the continent, while
   Pitt wanted a wholesale shift in policy to concentrate British forces
   in North America, West Africa and Asia where the French were most
   vulnerable. In spite of this they shared some views, were both ardent
   Whigs, and had once before tried to create a political alliance.
   Newcastle had previously tried to have Pitt appointed Secretary of War
   in 1745, but George II had vetoed the appointment.^[336][58]

   Ultimately British policies were formed of a mixture of these two
   views. Newcastle insisted on British involvement on the continent, to
   tie down French troops while at the same time authorising a number
   expedition against French colonies. As they were successfully the
   expeditions began to grow in number and size. Pitt largely took over
   control of directing them, while Newcastle signed off on them and made
   sure that [337]parliament was kept on side by mobilising his control of
   MPs.

   He retained his previous belief that Britain needed to create as broad
   a coalition as possible, and that events in Europe rather than the
   Americas would be decisive, and to this end he attempted a number of
   different states to join the alliance. He was largely unsuccessful, as
   the Dutch and German states stayed neutral. In the absence of this, he
   authorised large sums to be paid as subsidies to the Prussians, who
   were fighting two country's whose land forces dwarfed their own.

   One of his greatest personal achievements in the years was his use of
   diplomacy to keep [338]Spain out of the war until 1762, by which time
   it was too late to severely alter the balance of the war. In 1759 he
   and Pitt organised Britain's defences against a [339]planned French
   invasion.

[[340]edit] Dismissal

   Under this "[341]Broad bottom government", Britain became famous
   abroad, but it gradually fell before the affection of the new King,
   [342]George III for [343]Lord Bute, who, after supplanting Pitt, became
   Prime Minister in place of Newcastle in May 1762. George III had
   described Pitt as a "snake in the grass" and Newcastle as a
   "Knave".^[344][59] Despite the undeniably competent prosecution of the
   war, the new King did not trust either man with the future of Britain
   and cast them both into opposition. It marked arguably the last
   occasion on which a British monarch was able to remove a Prime Minister
   purely because of personal animosity, a privileged that would in future
   be entirely ceded to parliament. As Bute was a Tory, it marked the end
   of the Whig monopoly on government which had lasted since the
   Hanoverian Succession in 1714.

[[345]edit] Later years

   Newcastle spent much of his last few years at [346]Claremont. He was
   exceptionally proud of the house and its [347]extensive gardens on
   which he had spent a fortune.

[[348]edit] Opposition

          Further information: [349]Treaty of Paris

   The Duke went into strong opposition, and lost his two
   Lord-Lieutenancies for opposing the peace of 1763. Along with Pitt he
   felt the terms of peace were overly generous to France and Spain,
   considering the position of strength the British held. A number of the
   territories captured during the war were handed back, through the
   French presence had been effectively destroyed for good in [350]Canada
   and [351]India.

   He spent much of his time at his house at [352]Claremont, which he
   considered one of his finest achievements. Newcastle had been in
   government for almost forty five continuous years, and he initially
   enjoyed the new freedom that opposition gave him.

[[353]edit] Final return

   In 1765 he became [354]Lord Privy Seal in the government of [355]Lord
   Rockingham.^[356][60] Rockingham shared many similarities with
   Newcastle, and the two men were both wealthy Whig grandees. He lasted
   in this post for a few months before the government collapsed, to be
   replaced by that of the [357]Duke of Grafton.

[[358]edit] Retirement

   He remained in active opposition, although he accepted he would not
   hold office again.^[359][61] He continued to wield enormous patronage
   and influence, but his health was fast giving way, and he died in
   November 1768. In his final few months he had counselled against the
   [360]coercive acts on [361]British America.

   The Duke was industrious and energetic, and to his credit be it said
   that the statesman who almost monopolised the patronage of office for
   half a century twice refused a pension, and finally left office 300,000
   poorer than he entered it.

[[362]edit] Legacy and popular culture

   Newcastle was widely caricatured, often being portrayed as a
   muddle-headed buffoon who struggled to understand the business of
   government. He was one of the most ridiculed politicians of the
   eighteenth century.^[363][62] A common and widely circulated example of
   his cluelesness is his reported response to being told that
   [364]Annapolis needed to be defended, to which Newcastle allegedly
   replied "Annapolis! Oh yes, Annapolis must be defended, to be sure.
   Annapolis must be defended - where is Annapolis?".^[365][63]

   Historical opinion has generally been divided, with some historians
   drawing the conclusion that he was unfit for his office, while others
   regard him as a shrewd political operator, who subtly navigated the
   complex European State System of the eighteenth century. He is both
   praised and criticised as being perhaps the greatest "machine politics"
   operator of the eighteenth century, who commanded immense strength in
   parliament. He could often organise majorities in the House of Commons
   for seemingly perplexing and absurd policies of the government.

   Generally praise for Britain's victory in the Seven Years War has gone
   to Pitt rather than Newcastle, despite the fact it was he who
   officially headed the government. Traditionally accounts of the war
   have portrayed Pitt as a visionary who won the war by reversing
   Newcastle's previous unwise policy of focusing on European affairs.
   Others have defended Newcastle by contrasting his 'continental policy'
   with the failure of [366]Lord North to gather European allies during
   the [367]American War of Independence which led to Britain's defeat.

   He was portrayed in the novel [368]Humphrey Clinker by Tomias Smellet
   as a bungling fool, ignorant of all geography, who is convinced that
   [369]Cape Breton is not an island.^[370][64]

[[371]edit] Family

   Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne

   In 1718 the Duke married [372]Lady Henrietta Godolphin, daughter of the
   [373]2nd Earl of Godolphin and granddaughter of [374]John Churchill,
   1st Duke of Marlborough. The Duchess suffered from poor health and the
   couple had no children.^[375][65]

   In 1731, at [376]Houghton Hall, Sir Robert Walpole's [377]country house
   in [378]Norfolk, the Duke, with the [379]Duke of Lorraine (later the
   [380]Holy Roman Emperor), was made a Master Mason by the Grand Master,
   Lord Lovell, at an Occasional Lodge.^[[381]citation needed] In 1739, at
   the creation of London's [382]Foundling Hospital, he acted as one of
   the charity's founding governors.^[[383]citation needed]

[[384]edit] Succession

   With the prospect that the dukedom of Newcastle upon Tyne would become
   extinct once again, [385]King George II also created the Duke Duke of
   Newcastle-under-Lyne in 1756, with a special remainder for inheritance
   through his nephew, the [386]9th Earl of Lincoln.

   In addition, in 1762 he was also created Baron Pelham of Stanmer, with
   inheritance to his cousin and male heir, [387]Thomas Pelham.

   On his death in 1768, the title Baron Pelham of Stanmer, together with
   the bulk of the Pelham estates in Sussex and the Duke's private papers,
   were left to Thomas, who was later created [388]Earl of Chichester.

   The Holles/Clare estates, meanwhile, together with his Newcastle
   dukedom, were inherited by Lord Lincoln, from whom the Duke had by then
   become estranged.
