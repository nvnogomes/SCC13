   Theaters for diverse musical and dramatic presentations began to open
   in [11]Naples, [12]Italy, in the mid-16th century as part of the
   general Spanish cultural and political expansion into the [13]kingdom
   of Naples, which had just become a vicerealm of [14]Spain. None of the
   early theaters still function as such, having been replaced by later
   facilities in the mid-1700s; however, in many cases, the buildings
   still stand and have been converted to other uses. These theaters
   include:

[[15]edit] La Commedia

   Built around 1550, the theater was the professional home to acting
   troupes from Spain "playing the provinces," and it provided a stage for
   the improvised antics of the masked and costumed figures in the then
   innovative Italian [16]Commedia dell'arte. The theater was torn down
   and replaced by a church that still stands, called San Giorgio dei
   Genovesi, intended to serve the considerable Genovese population in
   Naples at the time. For many years, however, the church was called San
   Giorgo alla commedia vecchia (old theater), thus recalling the origins
   of the church.

[[17]edit] Teatro dei Fiorentini

   Built in the first decade of the 1600s, the Teatro dei Fiorentini was
   meant to replace the defunct Commedia theater. It survived as a theater
   into the 1700s and even survived the many subsequent years of
   surrounding urban renewal. An establishment calling itself the
   Fiorentino exists today on the same site but has not functioned as a
   theater for many years. It is, today, a [18]Bingo hall.

[[19]edit] Teatro San Bartolomeo

   The predecessor of the current opera theater, [20]San Carlo, was the
   theater of San Bartolomeo. Built in 1620, it was the site of the
   performances of the first real "opera" in Naplesthat is, works by
   Monteverdi and others from the north, which had begun to filter down to
   the south. San Bartolomeo was closed and replaced by the grand theater
   of San Carlo in 1737. The building, itself, still survives and was
   converted into a church.
