   This article is about The E. F. Schumacher Society, a non-profit
   education organization. For articles on persons named Schumacher, see
   [14]Schumacher.

   Founded in 1980, the E. F. Schumacher Society was named for
   [15]German-born economist [16]E. F. Schumacher, who moved to
   [17]England during [18]World War II. Author of [19]Small is Beautiful:
   Economics as if People Mattered (1973), [20]A Guide for the Perplexed
   (1977) and Good Work (1979). Schumacher argued for a system of diverse
   regional economies producing locally for local consumption in an
   ecologically and socially responsible manner what he called an
   "economics of permanence."

[[28]edit] History and mission

     "For twenty-six years the E. F. Schumacher Society has worked to
     engage scholars and citizen-activists in building strong local
     economies that link people, land, and community. Following
     Schumacher's lead, the Society's programs seek to create the
     foundations for a new economy based on the decentralization of
     wealth and power, democratic participation, human needs, and respect
     for the environment." -E. F. Schumacher Society

   The E. F. Schumacher Society, located in [29]Great Barrington,
   Massachusetts, was founded in 1980 by [30]Robert Swann and a group of
   [31]E. F. Schumachers [32]American friends and colleagues. A lifelong
   [33]pacifist and advocate of [34]decentralism, Swann was drawn to
   Schumachers ideas through reading his articles in [35]Resurgence
   magazine. In 1967 he went to [36]England to meet Schumacher and
   suggested to him that these articles be published in book form. This
   led directly to the collection of essays that became [37]Small Is
   Beautiful. Swann subsequently organized Schumachers 1974 North America
   tour to promote the book, a trip that was also to have a catalytic
   effect on the [38]sustainable energy movement in the [39]United States.
   At the end of the tour Schumacher suggested that Swann establish a
   United States-based group to work at the interface of [40]economics,
   [41]land use, and [42]applied technology. Six years later, at the
   urging of Ian Baldwin, David Ehrenfeld, [43]Hazel Henderson, [44]Satish
   Kumar, and John McClaughry, Robert Swann took on the challenge, and the
   E. F. Schumacher Society came into being. With [45]Susan Witt as the
   Executive Director, the Society continues to pursue its mission of
   helping to build strong local economies.

[[46]edit] Community land trust program

   A [47]community land trust's primary function is to buy or accept gifts
   of [48]land and [49]lease it back to members under a 99-year lease that
   is inheritable and automatically renewable. Through this long-term land
   lease, the trust removes land from the [50]speculative market and
   facilitates multiple uses such as [51]affordable housing,
   [52]agriculture, and preservation of [53]open space. In conjunction
   with land-use planners, local [54]government, and the community at
   large the trust determines the most appropriate use or uses for a given
   parcel of land, be it a [55]wildlife refuge, a group of houses, a
   managed woodlot, a commercial development, or a farm producing
   vegetables grown for the local market.

   The Community Land Trust in the Southern Berkshires currently holds
   three parcels of land. The first is Alvastra, a 10-acre (40,000 m^2)
   parcel at the foot of [56]Jug End Mountain that includes four
   residences, the E. F. Schumacher Society library and office, and an
   [57]apple [58]orchard planted in 1925. The second is Forest Row, a
   residential community of 18 dwellings on 21 acres (85,000 m^2), much of
   which is undeveloped woodlands. The third is [59]Indian Line Farm, an
   active [60]organic farm and the country's first [61]community-supported
   agriculture (CSA) farm. Indian Line Farm sits on 17 acres (69,000 m^2),
   including sensitive [62]wetland areas that are permanently
   [63]preserved.

[[64]edit] Local currency program

   The Schumacher Society believes that a vital local [65]economy depends
   on the affordable access to [66]credit for small import-replacing
   [67]businesses. [68]Local currencies are a form of [69]micro-credit and
   demonstrate visible [70]consumer support of [71]regional businesses.
   The Schumacher Society is a leader in the local currency movement, and
   in 2004 convened an international conference on local currencies
   entitled "Local Currencies in the 21^st Century." It is a primary
   sponsor of the issue of a southern Berkshire currency called BerkShares
   and has been responsible for the research and development of this
   program, which involves banks, the [72]Southern Berkshire Chamber of
   Commerce, local businesses, and local non-profits.

   [73]Local currencies are an important part of the work of the E.F.
   Schumacher Society. The Society has been involved in a number of local
   currency projects in the past, including Deli Dollars, a single-store
   [74]scrip issued in [75]Great Barrington, Massachusetts in 1989 with
   the help of Society staff. [76]Deli Dollars drew national media to the
   [77]Berkshire region, helped renew public interest in local currencies
   as a tool for community economic revitalization, and led to the current
   issue of [78]BerkShares.

[[79]edit] Lectures and seminars

   Each year on a Saturday in late October, the Society hosts three
   lectures on topics related to the thought of E. F. Schumacher. The
   Annual [80]E. F. Schumacher Lectures are a public forum for thinkers
   and activists doing work on transforming communities and economies. The
   lectures, edited by Hildegarde Hannum, are available in pamphlet form
   and in part in [81]People, Land, and Community (Yale University Press,
   1997) free of charge at the Society's web site. Past speakers include
   Peter Barnes, [82]Thomas Berry, [83]Wendell Berry, [84]David Brower,
   [85]Richard Heinberg, [86]Ivan Illich, [87]Wes Jackson, [88]Jane
   Jacobs, [89]Andrew Kimbrell, [90]Winona LaDuke, [91]Frances Moore Lapp,
   [92]Amory Lovins, David Orr, [93]Kirkpatrick Sale, [94]Cathrine Sneed,
   [95]John Todd, and Greg Watson.

   Additionally, the Society hosts an annual training seminar: "Building
   Sustainable Local Economies" focuses on issues that link people, land,
   and community in accordance with the mission of the Society. The
   seminar brings together young community leaders from around the country
   to study community-based tools for building sustainable economies and
   to share their experiences and lessons. Lecturers on a wide variety of
   specific topics and projects take part.

   The Society also hosts other events from time to time, most notably, an
   international conference in 2004 "Local Currencies in the 21^st
   Century."

[[96]edit] Library and online resources

   The personal libraries of Fritz Schumacher, Robert Swann (Society
   founder and founder of the community land trust movement), [97]George
   Benello (leader in worker cooperative movement), of [98]Robyn Van En
   (founder of first [99]community-supported agriculture farm in
   [100]North America and leader of the [101]CSA movement), [102]William
   Ellis (publisher of [103]TRANET, a newsletter covering
   [104]international development issues), [105]Dick Bliss (founder of
   East Hill School and leader in the alternative schools movement),
   [106]Peter Gillingham (partner with Fritz Schumacher in work on
   [107]appropriate technology), and other leading [108]decentralist
   thinkers. The Library, with its online catalogues, is a unique research
   opportunity for those exploring the roots of decentralist thought and
   action.

   The Society's website ([109][1]) provides free access to its
   publications, including the legal documents for its model programs,
   seminar background papers, conference proceedings, and position papers.
   It also contains an extensive directory of Community Land Trusts around
   the country.
