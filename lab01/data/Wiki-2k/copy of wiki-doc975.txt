   Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, which can be spelled a number of ways, is a
   children's [10]counting rhyme, used to select a person to be "it" for
   games and similar purposes. The rhyme has existed in various forms
   since the 1850s, or perhaps earlier, and is common in many countries.

   Since many similar counting rhymes existed earlier, it is difficult to
   ascertain this rhyme's exact origin.

[[45]edit] Current versions

   Many versions exist, both within cultures and between them. Some
   examples:

[[46]edit] United States and Canada

   It is usually sung:

          Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
          Catch a tiger by the toe.
          If he hollers let him go,
          Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

   Sometimes a line is added at the end of the rhyme to draw out (or to
   manipulate) the seemingly random selection process, such as:

          My mother told me to pick the best one,
          And you are not it!

   or other variations such as:

          Out goes one
          Out goes two
          Out goes another one
          And that is you.

   Another American version is:

          Eeny, meeny, miny moe,
          Catch a tiger by the toe.
          If he hollers make him pay,
          Fifty dollars every day.

   In Singaporean culture, children end on the second line and it commonly
   goes and ends like this:

          Catch the spider on the wall!

[[69]edit] History

   The earliest known published versions in the [70]English language date
   to 1855, one of which used the words eeny, meeny, moany, mite, and the
   other, hana, mana, mona, mike. Alternate versions have also appeared in
   several other [71]European languages.

   Many stories exist about the "real" meaning of the first line, although
   the most commonly accepted theory is that they are just [72]nonsense
   [73]syllables. Another theory posed by [74]Christopher Knight and
   [75]Robert Lomas in their book, [76]The Hiram Key, suggests that the
   words are the first numbers in the counting system of the pre-Celtic
   Britons. The [77]Lakeland Dialect Society more specifically suggests
   that this is just one of many versions of Celtic [78]sheep-counting
   rhymes, but it observes that a large number of 19th century English
   publications exist in which these counting rhymes were more often used
   to amuse children than to count sheep. ^[79][1]

   Another possibility is that the British occupiers of India brought a
   [80]doggerel version of an Indian children's rhyme used in the game of
   [81]carom billiards: "ubi eni mana bou, baji neki baji thou, elim tilim
   latim gou." ^[82][2] (p.157)

   The "Tiger" in the rhyme could be a reference to the [83]Tippu Sultan
   known as the "Tiger of Mysore" for his ferocity; he enjoyed hunting
   tigers and incorporated images of them into his flag. His defeat in
   1799 allowed the British to conquer India.

[[84]edit] Controversial version

   [85]Controversial alternative versions of this poem replace the word
   [86]tiger with the word [87]nigger, which in the eyes of some has
   tainted the rhyme entirely. Two early versions that use the
   substitution are:

   From [88]Rudyard Kipling's "A Counting-Out Song", from "Land and Sea
   Tales for Scouts and Guides," published in 1923:

          Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
          Catch a nigger by the toe!
          If he hollers let him go!
          Eenee, Meenee. Mainee, Mo!
          You are it!

   Kipling's version is similar to the most commonly reported version of
   the rhyme among American schoolchildren in 1888.^[89][3] Kipling's
   version was the most commonly recited version in the United States and
   Canada until as late as the early 1970s when even school aged children
   became aware of the political incorrectness of the poorly-aged wording.
   The word "tiger" soon became the standard, as parents were quick to
   correct their children not to use the "N" word.

   The chorus from [90]Bert Fitzgibbon's 1906 song "Eeny, Meeny, Miny,
   Mo", copyrighted by F.B. Haviland:

          Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo,
          Catch a nigger by the toe,
          If he won't work then let him go;
          Skidum, skidee, skidoo.
          But when you get money, your little bride
          Will surely find out where you hide,
          So there's the door and when I count four,
          Then out goes you.

   However, an earlier version using 'chicken' was printed in 1898:

          Eendy, Beendy, banida, roe,
          Catch a chicken by his toe

   And the Dorset Field Club recorded this version in 1917:

          Eenie, meenie, minie, mo,
          Catch a tinker by his toe.
          If he screams, let him go,
          Eenie, meenie, minie, mo.
          O.U.T. spells out,
          And out you must go.
          As fair as it can be.^[91][4]

   As pointed out in The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes,^[92][4] the
   word "nigger" was common in American folk-lore, but unknown in any
   English traditional rhyme or proverb. This, combined with evidence of
   various other versions of the rhyme in England that predate this
   version, suggest that likely became the most popular at some point in
   the 20th century and originated in America.

   Many people who grew up before the late 1960s are likely to report
   having heard or grown up with this controversial version of the rhyme.
   Since then, and especially after the [93]Civil Rights Act of 1964, this
   variation has become quite rare in the U.S. but may still be used in
   some circles.

   In this version of this poem, the third and fourth lines are often
   changed as seen below, and are also sometimes found in non-racist
   versions:

          If he hollers make him pay,
          Fifty dollars every day

   Yet other variations have been found from the 1940s with different
   words used in place of "tiger." Another controversial version of the
   rhyme from the WWII era is as follows:

          Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
          Catch a Jap by his toe
          If he hollers make him say,
          "I surrender, USA!"

[[94]edit] Lawsuit in the United States

   Jocular use of a form of the rhyme by a [95]Southwest Airlines
   [96]flight attendant, encouraging passengers to sit down so the plane
   could take off, led to a 2003 lawsuit charging the airline with
   [97]racism. A United States District Court in Kansas City found
   Southwest not liable in January 2004, a decision that was upheld on
   appeal.^[98][5]

   Two different versions of the rhyme were attested in court:

          Eeny meeny miny mo
          Please sit down it's time to go

   and

          Eeny meeny miny mo
          Pick a seat, it's time to go

   The passengers in question were [99]African American and stated that
   they were humiliated.

[[100]edit] Advertising

   The [101]Boulevard Brewing Company, of [102]Kansas City, Missouri, used
   the words under four glasses of beer on a billboard advertisement. A
   member of [103]The Kansas City Star's editorial board felt it was
   offensive, saying in the paper's op-ed page [104][2] that the rhyme
   "has an awful history, which is far from cute."

[[105]edit] Popular culture

   There are innumerable scenes in books, films, plays, cartoons and video
   games in which "Eeny meeny ..." or a variant is used by a character who
   is making a choice, either for serious or comic effect.

   The phrase sometimes appears in other ways, including:

[[106]edit] Literature

     * The title of [107]Chester Himes's novel [108]If He Hollers Let Him
       Go refers to the rhyme.
     * In [109]Salman Rushdie's [110]The Moor's Last Sigh, the leading
       character and his three sisters are nicknamed Ina, Minnie, Mynah
       and Moor.

[[111]edit] Film

     * In the 1930s, animation producer [112]Walter Lantz introduced the
       cartoon characters [113]Meany, Miney and Mo (later Meeny, Miney and
       Mo). First appearing in [114]Oswald Rabbit cartoons, then in their
       own series, the trio were semi-humanized chimpanzees; clothed,
       living in a [115]funny animal world but rarely speaking
       understandable words. Later, in the comics, the trio spoke English
       with the inflections of the [116]Three Stooges.
     * In Robert Hamer's 1949 film [117]Kind Hearts and Coronets, both
       Louis (Denis Price) and Sibella (Joan Greenwood) use the "nigger"
       version.
     * The 1957 [118]Bollywood hit [119]Asha uses an Indian variant as the
       basis for the song [120]Eena Meena Deeka.
     * The rhyme has been used by killers to choose victims in several
       films, including the 1994 films [121]Pulp Fiction and [122]Natural
       Born Killers; the 1997 film [123]Funny Games and its [124]2008
       remake; and the 2003 film [125]Elephant.

[[126]edit] Music

     * "Eeny Meeny Miney Mo" was a popular song written in 1935 by Johnny
       Mercer and Matty Malneck.
     * "Organ Grinder's Swing" was a hit in the 1930s for Ella Fitzgerald,
       who sang "eenie meenie miny moe, catch that monkey by the toe..."
     * The vinyl release of [127]Radiohead's album "[128]OK Computer" uses
       the words "eeny meeny miny moe" (rather than letter or numbers) on
       the labels of Sides A, B, C and D respectively.
