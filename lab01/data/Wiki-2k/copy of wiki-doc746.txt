[[42]edit] History

[[43]edit] Early Hindu kingdoms

   The district, like the rest of the [44]Deccan was under the Nandas and
   [45]Mauryas in its early history. After the fall of the [46]Mauryan
   Empire, the district was under the [47]Sathavahanas until the third
   century under the famous poet king [48]Hala. Coins found during
   excavations have revealed the rule of [49]Gautamiputra Satakarni,
   Vasisthi-putra Pulumayi and [50]Yajna Sri Satakarni. [51]Gupta emperor
   [52]Samudragupta invaded during the rule of both Pishtapura and
   Avamukta in the district in 350 A.D. Samudragupta's invasion was
   followed by the rule of the [53]Mathara Dynasty from 375 to 500. The
   earliest known ruler of the dynasty was [54]Maharaja [55]Sakthi Varma.

   The district passed into the hands of [56]Vishnukundinas during the
   rule of [57]Vikramendra Varma I during the 5th century. The records
   indicate that their domain extended over [58]Visakhapatnam, West
   Godavari, [59]Krishna and [60]Guntur Districts in addition to East
   Godavari District. [61]Indra Bhattaraka defeated the rulers of
   [62]Vasistha Kula and re-established Vihsnukundina authority, but was
   shortly defeated by [63]Kalinga armies. Indra Bhattaraka was followed
   to the throne by a few others, including [64]Madha Varma III and
   [65]Manchanna Bhattaraka, who tried to restore their kingdom. Madhava
   Varma III was the last important ruler of this family.

[[66]edit] [67]Chalukyas and [68]Cholas

   The [69]Pulakesin II of [70]Badami Chalukyas and his brother [71]Kubja
   Vishnu Vardhana acquired Pistapura in the 7th century. The [72]Eastern
   Chalukya dynasty, founded by Kubja Vishnu Vardhana, ruled at first form
   Pistapura, then from [73]Vengi, and later from [74]Rajahmundry. Many
   rulers held sway over the kingdom and their history is at times largely
   a record of disputes over succession. Chalukya Bhima I of this dynasty
   built a [75]Shiva temple at [76]Draksha Ramam. Jata Choda Bhima of Peda
   Kallu ([77]Kurnool District) killed Danarnava of this dynasty and
   occupied Vengi in 973 A.D. Danarnava's two sons, Sakti Varma I and
   Vimala Aditya, fled from the kingdom and took refuge in the court of
   the [78]Chola king [79]Rajaraja Chola I. Rajaraja invaded Vengi on
   behalf of the sons of Danarnava and killed Jata Choda Bhima. Satya Raya
   of the [80]Western Chalukyas of [81]Kalyani did not like the Chola
   influence in Vengi and the area witnessed many wars between the Cholas
   and Chalukyas. After the death of Vijaya Aditya VII in 0175 A.D., the
   Eastern Chalukya dynasty came to an end.

   [82]Kulothunga Chola I (Rajendra Chalukya), rival of Vijay Aditya VII,
   fought along the sides of Cholas and established the [83]Chalukya
   Cholas province. The district along with the rest of the Vengi kingdom
   became part of their empire. Major portions of the district were under
   Velanati Chodas, trustworthy chieftains to his. The famous rulers of
   this dynasty were [84]Gonka I, [85]Rajendra Choda I, [86]Gonka II and
   [87]Rajendra Choda II. [88]Vikram Aditya vii of Western Chalukyas
   occupied this region for short period, but it was recovered by
   [89]Chalukya Cholas and Velanti Chodas. Velanati chiefs also suppressed
   rebellions from [90]Haihayas of Kona, [91]Gonka II and Rudra of the
   [92]Kakatiya dynasty.

[[93]edit] [94]Kakatiyas and [95]Delhi Sultanate

   Inscriptions at this region including the ones at [96]Draksha Ramam in
   13th century throw light on their history. Prola II of the Kakatiya
   dynasty declared independence from the western Chalukyas and became a
   subject of [97]Chalukya Cholas. His son Rudra obtained the Godavari
   delta as gift from the Rajaraja II of Chalukya Cholas. Rudra's
   authority over the Godavari delta was challenged by the Velanadu
   Chodas. The Velanati king [98]Rajendra Choda II sent an army under his
   minister Davana Preggada against Rudra. Rudra was succeeded by his
   younger brother Mahadeva who died in a conflict with the [99]Yadavas of
   [100]Devagiri. His son Ganapathi succeeded to the Kakatiya throne.
   Ganapathi defated [101]Kalinga armies on the north, [102]Pandyas of
   [103]Madurai and [104]Cholas with the help of [105]Nellore Chodas. The
   Kakatiya power remained undisturbed in the Godavari region throughout
   the reign of Ganapathi and her daughter Rudrama devi. Pratap Rudra
   ascended the throne in 1295 and faced many attacks from [106]Sultans of
   Delhi. After his defeat by Muhammad-bin-Tughluq in 1323, the district
   came under the rule of the Delhi Sultnate. Muhammad-bin-Tughluq divided
   [107]South India into five provinces and appointed governors.

[[108]edit] Musunuri Nayaks, Reddy's and other Hindu Kingdoms

   Delhi sultans faced rebellions from the confederacy of local chiefs
   under the authority of Prolaya of the [109]Musunuri Nayaks clan. The
   [110]Reddis of Addanki, Koppula [111]Telaga's of Pithapuram and the
   Recherla Velamas of Rachakonda actively helped him. Warangal was
   liberated and Telugu land enjoyed freedom for fifty years. Musunuri
   Kapaya Nayaka appointed his relatives Toyyeti Anavota Nayaka and
   Mummadi Nayaka (Korukonda) as governors in Godavari region. Mummadi
   Nayaka married the niece of Kapaya Nayaka. Mummadi Nayaka lived till
   1388. He had three sons who ruled for a period of 40 years and later
   they were reduced to submission by the Reddies of Kondaveedu and their
   principality was merged in the kingdom of Kondaveedu. Subsequently,
   Narasimha Deva IV of Kalinga succeeded in conquering this region, but
   was repulsed by Anavota Reddy of Rajahmundry. He was succeeded by
   Anavema Reddy and Kumaragiri of the same dynasty.

   Kumaragiri fought many wars with the Racherlas of Rachakonda and the
   Kalinga rulers. He sent his general Kataya Vema along with Prince
   Anavota to conquer the eastern region. This resulted in the annexation
   of a large tract in the north as far as Simhachalam. The newly acquired
   territory was annexed to the Reddi Kingdom and constituted into a
   separate province called the eastern kingdom. Prince Anavota ruled this
   province with Raja-mahendra-varam as his capital. He died a premature
   death around 1395 and Kataya Vema, the general and brother-in-law of
   Kumar Giri, was given Rajamahendra Rajya in appreciation of the
   services rendered by him to the State. Kataya Vema's departure to
   Raja-mahendra-varam led to the seizure of the throne of Kondaveedu by
   force by Peda Komati Vema.

   Peda Komati Vema's authority was defined by Kataya Vema. Kataya Vema
   was also involved in conflict with Eruva chief Annadeva Choda, who
   managed to occupy a large portion of the Rajamahendra Rajya. He was,
   however, defeated and driven back by Kataya Vema. Later, Kataya Vema
   died in a battle with Anna Deva Choda. After his death, Allada Reddi
   placed Kataya Vemas' son Komaragiri on the throne of Rajamahendravaram
   and ruled the kingdom as his regent. Komarigiri died a premature death.
   Allada Reddi ruled this region till his death in 1420. About 1423, the
   Vijayanagara ruler Deva Raya II defeated Vira Bhadra, who was then
   ruling this kingdom and reduced it to subjection.

   At Kondaveedu, Racha Vema succeeded Peda Komati Vema to the throne. His
   rule was very oppressive, and he received little support from his
   subjects when the Gajapatis of Orissa and Rayas of Vijayanagar invaded
   the kingdom. Kapileswara Gajapati crushed the Reddi power and annexed
   the Rajamahendra Rajya to his dominion.

   After the death of Kapileswara Gajapati in 1470, there was a fight
   between his sons Hamvira and Purushottma for succession. Hamvira
   succeeded in occupying the throne with the help of Bahmanis but he
   could not retain it for long. Purushottama overthrew Hamvira and tried
   to reconquer Rajahmundry and other places. But Muhammad Shah III lead
   the forces to Rajahmundry. This battle, However, ended with the
   conclusion of peace treaty. After the death of Muhammad Shah III,
   Purushottama Gajapathi overran the whole of the Godavari-Krishna
   [112]doab and drove the Bahmani forces as far south as Kondaveedu.
   Purushottama was succeeded by his son Prataparudra. The Vijayanagar
   monarch Krishna Deva Raya invaded his kingdom and brought Rajahmundry
   under subjugation. However, a treaty was concluded wherein Pratapa
   Rudra agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Krishna Deva Raya in
   return of the territory north of the Krishna conquered by Krishna Deva
   Raya.

[[113]edit] Later Muslim Kingdoms

   Taking advantage of the disturbed conditions, the [114]Qutb Shahi ruler
   of [115]Golconda, Sultan Quli Qutb Shah, invaded the coastal region and
   took possession of Rajahmundry and the neighbouring kingdoms. Sultan
   Quli was murdered and he was succeeded to the throne by his son Jamshid
   Qutb Shah and then by his grand son Subhan Qutb Shah. During his reign,
   Ibrahim Qutb Shah had to ward off challenges from Shitab Khan and
   Vidyadhar. The last ruler of this dynasty was Abdual Hasan Tana Shas,
   who ruled from 1672 to 1687.

   During this period, the [116]Mughal emperor [117]Aurangzeb brought most
   of southern India under his control. Aurangzeb conquered the sultanate
   of Golconda in 1687, and Golconda, including East Godavari District,
   became one of the twenty-two provinces of the Mughal Empire. Aurangzeb
   appointed viceroys to carry out the administration of these provinces.
   The [118]Nizam-ul-Mulk (viceroy) of Golconda looked after the
   administration through military officers called Fauzdars. The Mughal
   emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed [119]Asaf Jah as the Nizam-ul-Mulk of
   the Deccan. He was, however, replaced by Husian Ali Khan, and during
   the time of emperor [120]Muhammad Shah, Asaf Jah invaded the Deccan,
   defeated and killed Mubariz Khan in the battle of Shakar Khera in 1724
   and ruled the Deccan as [121]Nizam of [122]Hyderabad.

   The Nizam-ul-Mulk's death in 1748 led to a war of succession between
   his son [123]Nasir Jung and his grandson [124]Muzaffar Jung. The French
   and the British took different sides each. The dispute ended with the
   accession of [125]Salabat Jung, with the help of the French General
   [126]Bussy. General Bussy was, however, summoned to the south by
   [127]Lally, the new Governor-General of the French possessions in
   India. As soon as he left, [128]Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju, the new
   Raja of [129]Vizianagaram, invited the English to come and occupy the
   [130]Northern Circars. The tussle that ensued between the French and
   the English ended with the French losing all possessions in Northern
   Circars, save for Yanam, which (save for brief periods of British rule)
   they would hold onto till after Indian independence in [131]1947.

   Salabat Jung was subsequently deposed by his brother [132]Nizam Ali
   Khan, who leased out Rajahmundry and [133]Chicacole to Hasan Ali Khan.
   Lord [134]Robert Clive, entered into negotiations with the Mughal
   Emperor [135]Shah Alam, and obtained a firman ceding the Northern
   Circars to the [136]British East India Company in August 1765, but it
   was kept a secret until March 1766. The fort of Kondapalli was seized
   by the British, and General Cillaud was sent to [137]Machilipatnam to
   undertake military operations, if necessary. The Nizam also made brisk
   preparations for war. War was prevented by the signing of a treaty on
   [138]November 12, [139]1766 by which the Company, in return for
   occupying the Circars, undertook to maintain troops for the Nizam's
   assistance.

   The [140]Zamindars came into prominence during the period preceding the
   transfer of the district to the British. The Zamindars of Rampa,
   Totapalli, Jaddangi, [141]Peddapuram, [142]Pithapuram, Kota and
   Ramchandrapuram were the important zamindars of this region.

[[143]edit] British rule, 1768-1947

   By a second treaty, signed on [144]March 1, [145]1768 the Nizam
   acknowledged the validity of Shah Alam's grant and resigned the Circars
   to the Company, receiving as a mark of friendship an annuity of 50,000.
   Finally, in 1823, the claims of the Nizam over the Northern Circars
   were bought outright by the Company, and they became a British
   possession. The Circars were incorporated into [146]Madras Presidency,
   and Godavari District was constituted, which included present-day East
   Godavari and West Godavari districts.

[[147]edit] Since Indian independence, 1947-present

   After India's independence in 1947, the former Madras Presidency of
   [148]British India became India's [149]Madras State. In 1953, the
   northern districts of Madras state, including Godavari District, became
   the new state of Andhra Pradesh. [150]Yanam was relinquished by the
   French in 1954, but one condition of the cession treaty was the
   retention of the district's separate and distinct identity, which also
   applied to the other South Indian enclaves constituting today's
   [151]Pondicherry state.

[[152]edit] Tourism

   East Godavri has a tremendous potential to become a major tourist
   centre in the country. The sight of the river Godavari piercing the
   eastern ghats with great turns and the forests surrounding the river
   forming a beautiful green carpet on the hills is a delightful sight.

[[158]edit] Transport

   East Godavari is well connected through Rail, Road, Water and Air. The
   [159]National Highway 5 connecting [160]Chennai and [161]Howrah passes
   through this district. Rajahmundry and Samarlakota are the railway
   junctions in the district. The Chennai to Howrah rail line also passes
   through this district. The district has an airport at
   Madhurapudi(Rajahmundry Rural), which is 10 km from Rajahmundry and 65
   km from Kakinada. There are regular flights from Rajahmundry to
   Hyderabad, Chennai, Vijayawada etc. Kakinada has sea port which is
   predicted to be a potentially important port after Chennai, Paradip and
   Visakhapatnam along the east coast of India.

[[162]edit] Government

   It is the only district to possess two municipal corporations. They are
   [163]Kakinada and [164]Rajahmundry

   The district is divided into 5 Revenue Divisions and 60 revenue mandals
   among which 58 are rural and 2 are urban. The district has 57 Mandal
   Praja Parishads and 1,011 Gram Panchayats^[165][1] and nine
   Municipalities and Municipal Corporations. Total number of villages in
   the district is 1,379.

   05-06-2002 a new Rural Mandal Routhulapudi (44 villages) with head
   quarters at Routhulapudi was formed by transferring certain villages
   from Sankhavaram (12 villages), Kotananduru (31 villages) and Tuni (1
   village) Mandals, there by making total number of Mandals to be 60.
