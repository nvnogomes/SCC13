[[18]edit] Education

   She received a degree in [19]psychology ([20]summa cum laude) from
   [21]Brooklyn College, in 1976. She was admitted into [22]New York
   University's School of Law on a full scholarship, from which she
   graduated in 1979.

[[23]edit] Professional Life

   Judge Ling-Cohan began her career as an [24]attorney working for
   several [25]New York Legal Services agencies, representing indigent
   clients, before she joined the New York State Attorney General's
   consumer fraud protection unit. Additionally, she taught classes in
   [26]law and [27]Asian American studies at [28]CUNY Law School, New York
   University, [29]City College, and [30]Queens College. In 1995 Judge
   Ling-Cohan was elected to the Civil Court of the City of New York from
   the Second Municipal Court District. At this time, Judge Ling-Cohan
   decided to seek elected positions rather than appointed ones, believing
   that judges who are continually tested by public opinion have a greater
   chance of later being elected to the State Supreme Court. In 2002,
   after being nominated by the [31]Manhattan Democracy party for election
   to the New York State Supreme Court, she received the support of the
   state [32]Republican, [33]Democratic, Liberal, and Working Family
   parties. Ling-Cohan was elected to that post, receiving more than
   230,000 votes. Judge Ling-Cohan is a member of several professional and
   humanitarian associations; she is a founding member of the [34]Asian
   American Bar Association and the [35]New York Asian Women's Center --
   which is the first group dedicated to the prevention of [36]domestic
   violence in New York City's Asian communities. Additionally, she is a
   member of the [37]Jade Council, an organization for Asian court
   employees.

   [38]Brooklyn College has honored Judge Ling-Cohan with its
   Distinguished [39]Alumna Award, in recognition of her service to New
   York city as well as her advocacy for [40]immigrants and non-English
   speakers' rights.

[[41]edit] Same-sex marriage

   Judge Ling-Cohan made national news when she handed down a ruling in
   Hernandez v. Robles, a case in which 5 gay and lesbian couples had sued
   New York, arguing that denying them marriage rights violated the state
   constitution. Ling-Cohan sided with the plaintiffs, and as of
   [42]February 15, [43]2005, the ruling is on hold pending the outcome of
   an appeal filed by the state. See Judge Ling-Cohan's ruling in
   [44]Hernandez v. Robles ([45]PDF file) (The decision was subsequently
   reversed by two appellate courts).
