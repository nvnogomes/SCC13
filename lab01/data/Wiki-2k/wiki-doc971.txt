   Edwin Lewis

   Edwin Lewis (1881 1959) was an American [8]Methodist theologian
   primarily associated with [9]Drew University in [10]New Jersey.

   Born in [11]Great Britain, Lewis traveled to [12]Canada as a
   [13]missionary before continuing his education in the [14]United
   States. He eventually became a professor of theology at Drew.

   Lewis' early work demonstrates the influence of Boston personalism, a
   school of [15]Protestant liberal theology widespread among Methodists
   during the first half of the 20th century, and British [16]idealism.
   His book Jesus Christ and the Human Quest is an example of his early
   perspective. In the book, Lewis argues that the Christian faith has its
   foundation in the nature of persons and personhood.

   In 1929 he was named editor of the Abingdon Bible Commentary. While
   preparing the massive reference work, Lewis claimed to have
   "rediscovered the Bible" for himself. He reacted strongly to the 1931
   Laymen's Missionary Report, which he believed hampered the Christian
   missionary effort, in his article "The Re-thought Theology of the
   Re-thinking of Missions" which appeared in the [17]Christian Century.

   Growing more suspicious of the subjective theological liberalism of the
   day, he published A Christian Manifesto in 1934. In the book, Lewis
   railed against liberal theology (which he referred to as
   [18]modernism), reasserting classical Christian themes such as the
   transcendence of God, the [19]sinfulness of humankind, the [20]divinity
   of Christ, and the [21]objective work of the atonement.

   Lewis wrote: "No statement of Christian belief which does not include a
   supernatural reference...is a true statement."^[22]1

   He followed A Christian Manifesto with A Philosophy of Christian
   Revelation and The Creator and the Adversary, both of which continued
   his reclamation of Christian orthodoxy from an [23]Arminian
   perspective. Lewis argued that God triumphs over evil by outsuffering
   and outloving his adversary.^[24]2

   Lewis' work proved influential to an entire generation of Methodist
   theologians, notably Carl Michalson and [25]Albert C. Outler.
