[[55]edit] Types of re-editing

   Films edited for format, length, and content.
     * Format: [56]movie theaters typically show films in either a 1.85:1
       aspect ratio or 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Television currently has two
       screen formats. There is the more standard 1.33:1 (or 4:3) aspect
       ratio, and the growing standard of 1.78:1 (or 16:9) aspect ratio.

     * Length: Films may be shortened for [57]television [58]broadcasting
       or for use on [59]airlines. DVD releases of films may also contain
       longer cuts. In a growing trend, more and more films are being
       released in an Unrated cut of the film. Prior to when TV airings of
       the movie begins, a format screen appears reading, "The following
       film has been modified from its original version. It has been
       formatted to fit this screen and edited to run in the time allotted
       and for content(see below)". The end credits on TV airings of films
       are sometimes sped up to make time free for the next show or film
       to start.

     * Content: Some films have content deemed objectionable to "family
       audiences": sexual content, [60]obscene language, and [61]graphic
       violence. To make these films suitable for younger or more
       conservative audiences, or to appeal to [62]advertisers when a film
       is shown on [63]basic cable or [64]broadcast TV, alternative
       versions are created with such content removed. Often,
       [65]profanities are replaced with [66]minced oaths. For example, in
       the edited version of [67]Pulp Fiction, [68]Samuel L. Jackson uses
       the [69]minced oath "[70]screw" instead of "[71]fuck." The editing
       of these versions is performed by a censor and not the producer or
       director of the work. Two other examples would be in the edited
       version of [72]Mrs. Doubtfire, when [73]Daniel Hillard's mask is
       run over, he screams "Oh!", whereas in the original version, he
       screams, "Oh shit!" and in the [74]1987 [75]comedy film,
       [76]Planes, Trains & Automobiles, where [77]Neal Page is at the Car
       Rental Agency, and says the word "fuck" 18 times and the car rental
       agent says to him, "You're fucked!" which is edited out on TV
       airings. Also, on TV airings of [78]Disney's [79]Atlantis: The Lost
       Empire, all scenes of Packard smoking a cigarette are cut and on
       airings of [80]Disney's [81]The Parent Trap, the scene where
       [82]Hallie pierces [83]Annie's ears is short, whereas in the
       original theatrical version, the "[84]ear piercing" scene is
       longer. Annie's lines, "Marriage is supposed to be based on
       something more than just sex, right?" and "Oh my God! Oh my God!"
       are also cut. These films are typically preceded by the disclaimer,
       "This film has been modified from its original version. It has been
       formatted to fit this screen and edited for content."

[[85]edit] History

   The first theatrical film to be re-edited for television was the 1955
   film [86]The Seven Year Itch.^[[87]citation needed]

   Re-edited films have existed for several decades for broadcast
   television and on airlines. Since the advent of [88]VHS films being
   readily available in the mass consumer market, some consumer groups
   have asked films studios to make the airline version of films available
   for wide release.^[[89]citation needed]

[[90]edit] Re-editing techniques

   There are two main techniques for re-editing films:

[[91]edit] Manual re-editing

   Purchased film content is downloaded onto an editing work station hard
   drive and third-party editors manually re-edit the video and audio
   tracks, removing objectionable content. The re-edited version is then
   copied onto media (VHS or DVD) and made available for rental or
   purchase provided an original version has been purchased in correlation
   with the re-edited copy. Some manual re-edits are done by fans (see
   [92]The Phantom Edit) to cut a film to their own -or their peers-
   specifications.

   Although the recent court ruling prohibits business from manually
   re-editing commercial movies, the law still allows for individuals to
   self censor and edit their own movies for personal use.

[[93]edit] Programmed re-editing

   Programmed re-editing occurs when software (such as that employed in a
   DVD player) is used to skip portions of the video and/or audio content
   on-the-fly according to pre-programmed instruction sets which are
   knowingly used by the consumer.

[[94]edit] History of manual re-editing

   In response to consumer demand, families began to re-edit purchased VHS
   tapes literally by making cuts and splices to the tape. A hotbed for
   this activity has been Utah with its conservative yet entrepreneurial
   population. When [95]Titanic was released on VHS, a video store owner
   in Utah began offering to re-edit purchased copies of the movie for a
   $5 service fee. The service became very popular. Before long, several
   video rental businesses purchased VHS tapes and had them re-edited for
   their rental club/co-op members to watch.

   When DVD technology emerged, the re-editing industry began offering for
   sale or rental a disabled DVD accompanied by a re-edited version of the
   film on a coupled DVD-R. Several companies attempted this business.
   First, some tried to do it via physical brick and mortar stores, the
   most successful being the deal model and proprietary stores owned by
   [96]CleanFlicks, Inc. of Utah. [97]CleanFilms later became the largest
   and most successful company in the business by employing an online
   rental model (similar to [98]Netflix) and avoiding any physical stores.
   CleanFlicks and CleanFilms were sued with several others and a federal
   judge in Colorado ruled that the companies were violating copyright.
   Those named in the lawsuit ceased renting and selling edited movies.
   The legal argument was that the editing resulted in a derivation on a
   fixed media. At all times, for instance, CleanFilms sold edited movies
   with a legitimately purchased original copy. Furthermore, every rented
   unit in edited format had a corresponding original copy that was
   purchased at retail. The judge ruled that the fixed media caused the
   violation. ClearPlay was not affected by this ruling.

   The lawsuit started because a CleanFlicks franchisee in Colorado
   pre-emptively sued major directors. The franchisee feared the directors
   were going to sue because the DGA's website said as much. The
   [99]Directors Guild of America and the [100]Motion Picture Association
   of America counter-sued and also included several edited movie
   companies for copyright infringement and claims regarding derivative
   works. In 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch of the [101]United States
   District Court for the District of Colorado ruled that it was a
   copyright violation to distribute re-edited movies without the consent
   from the movie studios (key was the fixed media aspect of the
   businesses).

[[102]edit] History of programmed re-editing

   ClearPlay was sued by the DGA and MPAA, but the case was rendered moot
   by the [103]The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, which
   clarified that ClearPlay's filtering approach was legal and did not
   violate copyright law. As a result, ClearPlay has been able to offer
   its products to consumers in the U.S. while others have discontinued
   for legal reasons.

   Another aspect of re-editing comes with consumer made edits, which are
   called fan edits (or fanedits). It is when consumers load the movies
   into their computers and use video editing software to produce mostly a
   version with changed content for their own entertainment. Fan edits are
   becoming more popular since they are spread over the internet.

[[104]edit] Future of the industry

   It is unclear where this industry is headed. There is demand for the
   product. An ABC News poll of 1,002 adults from across the nation found
   that almost 40% of Americans said they might rent re-edited films,
   while 51% of respondents said that re-editing should not be allowed
   (with a 3-point error margin).^[105][1]

   Surprisingly, there are numerous companies continuing to sell edited
   movies on the Internet. A simple Google search for "edited movies" will
   list several purveyors. It seems the studio effort to stop this
   movement is not eliminating the availability of edited movies.
