   Drizzt Do'Urden (IPA: [22]/drst dordn/)^[23][1] is a fictional
   character in the [24]Forgotten Realms setting based on the [25]Dungeons
   & Dragons [26]fantasy [27]role-playing game. Drizzt was originally
   created by author [28]R. A. Salvatore as a supporting character in the
   [29]Icewind Dale Trilogy. Salavatore created him on a whim when his
   publisher needed to replace another character in Salvatore's first
   novel, The Crystal Shard. Drizzt has since become a popular heroic
   character of the Forgotten Realms setting, featured as the main
   character of a long series of books, starting chronologically with The
   Dark Elf Trilogy. As a non-archetypal [30]drow (dark elf), Drizzt has
   forsaken both the evil ways of his people and their home (in the
   [31]Underdark, in the drow city of [32]Menzoberranzan).

   Drizzt's story is told in Salvatore's fantasy novels: [33]The Icewind
   Dale Trilogy, [34]The Dark Elf Trilogy, the [35]Legacy of the Drow
   series, the [36]Paths of Darkness series, [37]The Hunter's Blades
   Trilogy, the latest [38]Transitions series, and the short stories "The
   Dowry" and "Dark Mirror." All of the novels featuring Drizzt have made
   the [39]New York Times Best Seller list. A number of the novels have
   been adapted as [40]graphic novels by [41]Devils Due Publishing. Drizzt
   has also been featured in D&D-based [42]computer role-playing games,
   including the [43]Baldur's Gate Series and [44]Forgotten Realms: Demon
   Stone.

[[52]edit] Concept and creation

   Drizzt Do'Urden's stories are set in the Forgotten Realms, the most
   popular setting in Dungeons & Dragons.^[53][2] The character has been a
   steady source of income for Salvatore, appearing in his novels for 20
   years. Drizzt is a [54]drow who plays against type, favoring friendship
   and peace over hatred and violence. His anti-stereotypical drow
   personality creates the conflict that allows Salvatore to create so
   many novels with stories about courage and friendship.^[55][3] Drizzt
   fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow.^[56][4]

   Salvatore uses Drizzt to represent issues of racial prejudice,
   particularly in "The Dark Elf" trilogy. For instance, Drizzt is
   concerned that if he and his love [57]Cattie-Brie (a human) have
   children, their offspring will face hostility from both races.^[58][5]
   Drizzt is also troubled by the lifespan discrepancy between himself
   (elves live hundreds of years) and Cattie-Brie.^[59][6]

   Drizzt was created by happenstance. In 1987 [60]R.A. Salvatore sent
   [61]Mary Kirchoff, then managing editor of [62]TSR's book department, a
   manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth
   Magic. She liked it, but asked if he could rewrite it to take place in
   the [63]Forgotten Realms. She sent him [64]Darkwalker on Moonshae by
   [65]Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten
   Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but
   Kichoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she
   wanted a new story set in a different part of the Realms. After two
   weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not
   already designated for another project, and he located [66]Icewind Dale
   there.^[67][1]

   Salvatore created Drizzt on a whim. He was under pressure to create a
   [68]sidekick for [69]Wulfgar in the [70]Icewind Dale series.^[71][1]
   Salvatore had sent an early version of [72]The Crystal Shard (his first
   published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on
   her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him
   that they could not use one of characters. He asked for time to think,
   but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head,
   Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore
   convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She
   asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could
   spell it, and he said "not a chance."^[73][1]^[74][7] Recalling the
   Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said "I don't know where
   it came from. I guess that [75]Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job
   in creating the [76]drow [77]elves that something about them got stuck
   in the back of my head. Thank God!"^[78][8] Although many readers have
   assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many [79]Dungeons & Dragons
   role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the
   case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works
   of [80]J. R. R. Tolkien. "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between
   Daryth from [Darkwalker on Moonshae] and [81]Aragorn from [82]The Lord
   of the Rings."^[83][1]

[[84]edit] Publication history

   R.A. Salvatore

   Drizzt's story begins in the novel Homeland, the start of [85]The Dark
   Elf Trilogy and published as a prequel in 1990 to The Icewind Dale
   Trilogy, which was published in 19881990. In the book, Drizzt is born
   in [86]Menzoberranzan as the third son to Matron Malice, the leader of
   [87]House Do'Urden (a type of family akin to a Scottish [88]clan). His
   father is [89]Zaknafein, a weapons master who secretly hates drow
   society and teaches Drizzt his [90]martial skills as he reinforces
   Drizzt's innate moral code. The 1996 short story "The Fires of
   Narbondel", in the Realms of the Underdark [91]anthology, describes
   unrelated events involving Zaknafein as the main character, and a young
   Drizzt plays a supporting role.

   During a raid against a group of surface elves, Drizzt finds himself
   unable to participate in the slaughter with his fellow drow. He
   pretends to kill an [92]elf child, but actually helps her to escape.
   When the deception is discovered, Zaknafein is sacrificed in Drizzt's
   stead to appease Lolth, the drow's god. Following a war against another
   House, Drizzt curses his family and the evil drow ways and escapes
   Menzoberranzan into the [93]Underdark. At this time he also acquires
   the statuette that allows him to summon the magical panther
   [94]Guenhwyvar. Guenhwyvar travels by Drizzt's side as he makes his way
   across the Realms.

   Drizzt fights off the resurrected spirit-wraith of his father in Exile,
   the second book in the Dark Elf Trilogy and also published in 1990.
   Sojourn^[95][9] picks up the story when Drizzt leaves the Underdark for
   the surface, where he meets a blind human [96]ranger named [97]Montolio
   Debrouchee. When Montolio begins teaching him the ways of the ranger,
   Drizzt realizes that, unknowingly, he had been following those very
   principles his entire life. From then on Drizzt's patron goddess is
   [98]Mielikki, the [99]Faernian goddess of the forest and of rangers.
   Montolio eventually dies, and Drizzt travels the Realms in search of a
   new home. He eventually finds himself in [100]Icewind Dale where he
   meets [101]dwarven king [102]Bruenor Battlehammer, and Bruenor's
   adopted human daughter, [103]Catti-brie.

   The fourth book chronologically in the series, although the first
   published, is The Crystal Shard (1988), the first in [104]The Icewind
   Dale Trilogy. It describes Drizzt's meeting with the barbarian
   [105]Wulfgar and the [106]halfling [107]Regis, and their adventures as
   they stop [108]Akar Kessel, a [109]mage possessed by the [110]sentient
   artifact [111]Crenshinibon (the book's [112]eponymous Crystal Shard),
   from gaining control of the region. Streams of Silver (1989), tells the
   story of the group as the journey for [113]Mithril Hall, Bruenor's
   boyhood home. [114]Artemis Entreri, a recurring character in the
   series, also makes his first appearance. In later books, Artemis is
   Drizzt's equal in combat, and they clash often due to their conflicting
   views and goals. In the 1990 book, The Halfling's Gem,^[115][10]
   Artemis kidnaps Regis while in the employ of a powerful crimelord.
   Drizzt and Wulfgar chase the assassin by sea, with the help of
   [116]Captain Deudermont, to recover Regis. He ends up in combat with
   Artemis Entreri, who leaves the battle wounded. At the end of the book,
   the group finds Regis and Guenhwyvar kills Artemis's employer.

   [117]Legacy of the Drow is a [118]tetralogy, unlike the previous two
   trilogies. The 1993 short story, Dark Mirror, in the Realms of Valor
   anthology, describes events just prior to the series. The first three
   books, The Legacy,^[119][11] Starless Night,^[120][12] and Siege of
   Darkness,^[121][13] describe a drow attack on Mithril Hall. Wulfgar is
   slain by a [122]yochlol, and Drizzt returns to Menzoberranzan to
   prevent his friends from being further attacked by dark elves. The drow
   launch a second attack against Mithril Hall during the [123]Time of
   Troubles. It is eventually repelled and Drizzt returns to his friends.

   Passage to Dawn,^[124][14] the final book in the Legacy of the Drow
   series and published two years after Siege of Darkness, picks up the
   story six years after the drow attack. Drizzt and Catti-Brie work with
   Captain Deudermont on his pirate-hunting ship, with the Companions of
   the Hall eventually fighting a powerful [125]demon who is aided by the
   Crystal Shard, which had been thought destroyed. Wulfgar, never truly
   dead, returns to life from the [126]Abyss as the demon who had held his
   soul was destroyed.

   He is the main character in only two books of the [127]Paths of
   Darkness series. The Silent Blade (1998) describes the group's journey
   to permanently destroy the Crystal Shard. Sea of Swords
   (2001)^[128][15] continues Drizzt's story after the events of The Spine
   of the World (1999), which focuses on Wulfgar, and Servant of the Shard
   (2000), which has Artemis Entreri and [129]Jarlaxle as the main
   characters. Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's
   lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the reunion of the group after
   an extended separation.

   Drizzt returns as the main character throughout [130]The Hunter's
   Blades Trilogy. In The Thousand Orcs (2002),^[131][16] Drizzt and his
   friends encounter the powerful [132]orc, [133]Obould Many-Arrows, who
   has employed [134]frost giants to aid him in gaining control of the
   region. After a battle at the town of Shallows, Drizzt believes the
   other Companions of the Hall to have fallen in battle, and he sets off
   into the wilderness to fight all orcs in vengeance. The Lone Drow
   (2003)^[135][17] continues this storyline as the still-living
   Companions protect Mithril Hall from orc attacks without the aid of
   Drizzt. He is reunited with his friends in The Two Swords
   (2003).^[136][18]

   R.A. Salvatore's next series of Forgotten Realms books, [137]The
   Sellswords Trilogy, focus on the further adventures of Artemis Entreri
   and Jarlaxle, with Drizzt only being mentioned in them. However, Drizzt
   is once again the main character in the [138]Transitions trilogy,
   consisting of The Orc King,^[139][19] The Pirate King,^[140][20] and
   The Ghost King (to be released in October 2009).

[[141]edit] Reception

   Salvatore mixes neatly choreographed battles with philosophical musings
   from self-styled "renegade soul" Drizzt, lending a little depth to an
   otherwise straightforward hack-and-slash adventure.
   [142]Publishers Weekly review of The Orc King

   The Drizzt Do'Urden books are popular with fantasy fans,^[143][21] and
   the Drizzt character is author R.A. Salvatore's best known creation.
   All 18 novels featuring Drizzt by Salvatore have made the [144]New York
   Times Best Seller list, starting with The Crystal
   Shard.^[145][22]^[146][20] The Orc King, which marked the 20th
   anniversary of the character made it to #7 on the list, as well as #9
   on the [147]Wall Street Journal list, #6 on the [148]Publishers Weekly
   bestseller list, and #36 on the [149]USA Today list of top sellers. The
   Two Swords peaked at #4 on the New York Times Best Seller list in
   2004.^[150][22]

   The Two Swords reached the top of the Wall Street Journal's hardcover
   bestseller list after only two weeks; a record for its publisher
   Wizards of the Coast. It also debuted at #4 on The New York Times's
   bestseller list and #2 on Publisher's Weekly bestseller list. The Lone
   Drow debuted at #7 on the New York Times Best Seller list in October
   2003.^[151][2] Publishers Weekly felt that The Lone Drow was clichd,
   but that some of the characters did achieve "some complexity". They
   singled out two characters for praise: Innovindel, an elf who talks
   "pensively" of her long life in contrast to the short lived humans, and
   Obould the orc king.^[152][6] A special Icewind Dale adventure was
   featured as the centerpiece at the November 3, 2007, [153]Worldwide
   Dungeons and Dragons Game Day event, in honor of the 20th anniversary
   of the creation of Drizzt.^[154][23]

   According to [155]PopMatters' Andrew Welsh, Drizzt is Salvatore's
   attempt to create a multifaceted character who faces internal
   struggles, in hopes of standing out from the drow, and fantasy fiction
   in general. Welsh feels that Salvatore fails in this regard, saying
   "any blood Drizzt finds on his hands is quickly justified and most
   internal conflict is superficial at best."^[156][3]

[[157]edit] Other media

   Drizzt Do'Urden has been featured in several accessories and one book
   for the [158]Advanced Dungeons & Dragons [159]fantasy [160]role-playing
   game. The [161]Hall of Heroes accessory for the [162]second edition of
   Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, published in 1989, features a four-page
   description and game statistics for Drizzt and Guenhwyvar, written by
   R. A. Salvatore.^[163][24] The [164]Heroes' Lorebook accessory,
   published in 1996 and written by Dale Donovan and Paul Culotta,
   features an update and revision of Drizzt's information from Hall of
   Heroes.^[165][25] The 1999 accessory, Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the
   Underdark by Eric L. Boyd, details the cities and civilizations of
   [166]Faern's [167]Underdark through the perspective of the title
   character.^[168][26] The [169]Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting
   hardcover for the game's [170]third edition features a brief
   description and game statistics for Drizzt for this edition, under the
   section on the [171]Sword Coast North.^[172][27]

   Drizzt has also appeared in a number of [173]graphic novels, video
   games, and as a [174]miniature figure. Beginning in 2005, [175]Devil's
   Due Publishing began releasing comic book adaptations of the Drizzt
   novels, covering each book in a three-issue mini-series along with a
   trade paperback collection. To date, Homeland, Exile, Sojourn, The
   Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, The Halfling's Gem, The Legacy, and
   Starless Night have been released.^[176][28] The character has appeared
   in several video games. In [177]Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone he is a
   playable character in the game's seventh stage, described by a writer
   for Imagine Games Network ([178]IGN) as "cool but utterly
   ineffective."^[179][29] He is also a playable character in
   [180]Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II.^[181][30] A friendly or hostile
   version of Drizzt can be created in [182]Baldur's Gate with a
   [183]cheat code.^[184][31] Drizzt is also included in the Dungeons and
   Dragons Miniatures game, in the Legend of Drizzt Scenario Pack that
   also includes Wulfgar and the dragon Icingdeath. An enclosed booklet
   lets players recreate the battle between Drizzt, Wulfgar, and the
   dragon.^[185][32] The boxed set was nominated for Best Miniature
   Product at the 2008 [186]ENnies.^[187][33]
