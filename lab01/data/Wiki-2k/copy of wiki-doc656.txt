   The overall goal of this Health informatics - Electronic Health Record
   Communication (EN 13606) European Standard is to define a rigorous and
   stable information architecture for communicating part or all of the
   Electronic Health Record (EHR) of a single subject of care (patient).
   This is to support the interoperability of systems and components that
   need to communicate (access, transfer, add or modify) EHR data via
   electronic messages or as distributed objects:

   preserving the original clinical meaning intended by the author;

   reflecting the confidentiality of that data as intended by the author
   and patient.

   The name of this European Standard suggests that it is not intended to
   specify the internal architecture or database design of EHR systems or
   components, but the scope includes the use of an 'object'. This implies
   that the 'objects' can be stored, retrieved and exchanged. It is
   explicitly not intended to prescribe the kinds of clinical applications
   that might request or contribute EHR data in particular settings,
   domains or specialities. For this reason, the information model
   proposed here is called the EHR Extract, and might be used to define a
   message, an XML document or schema, or an object interface. The
   information model in this European Standard is an ISO RM-ODP
   Information Viewpoint of the EHR Extract. This European Standard
   considers the EHR to be the persistent longitudinal and potentially
   multi-enterprise or multi-national record of health and care provision
   relating to a single subject of care (the patient), created and stored
   in one or more physical systems in order to inform the subjects future
   health care and to provide a medico-legal record of care that has been
   provided. Whilst an EHR service or system will need to interact with
   many other services or systems providing terminology, medical
   knowledge, guidelines, workflow, security, persons registries, billing
   etc. this European Standard has only touched on those areas if some
   persistent trace of such interactions is required in the EHR itself,
   and requires specific features in the reference model to allow their
   communication. This European Standard may offer a practical and useful
   contribution to the design of EHR systems but will primarily be
   realised as a common set of external interfaces or messages built on
   otherwise heterogeneous clinical systems.

   The [11]openEHR Framework is the basis of this new Electronic Health
   Record Communication Standard (EN 13606)

[[12]edit] Technical approach

   This European Standard has drawn on the practical experience that has
   been gained in implementing its European predecessor, ENV 13606, other
   EHR-related standards and specifications, commercial systems and
   demonstrator pilots in the communication of whole or part of patients
   EHRs, and on fifteen years of research findings in the field. This
   European Standard builds on ENV 13606, updating it in order to make it
   more rigorous and complete, to accommodate new requirements identified,
   to incorporate a robust means of applying the generic models to
   individual clinical domains, and to enable communication using HL7
   version 3 messages. A mapping from the existing prestandard is also
   provided to support implementers of existing conformant systems. The
   technical approach to producing this European Standard has taken into
   account several contemporary areas of requirement.

   a. In addition to a traditional message-based communication between
   isolated clinical systems, the Electronic Health Record will in some
   cases be implemented as a middleware component (a record server) using
   distributed object technology and/or web services.

   b. Customers of such record services will be not only other electronic
   health record systems but also other middleware services such as
   security components, workflow systems, alerting and decision support
   services and other medical knowledge agents.

   c. There is wide international interest in this work, and this European
   Standard has been drafted jointly through CEN and ISO with significant
   input from many member countries.

   d. Mapping to HL7 version 3 has been considered an important goal, to
   enable conformance to this European Standard within an HL7 version 3
   environment.

   e. The R&D inputs on which ENV 13606 was based have moved forward since
   1999 and important new contributions to the field have been taken into
   account. The [13]openEHR foundation, integrating threads of R&D in
   Europe and Australia, is one such example.

   Given the diversity of deployed EHR systems, this European Standard has
   made most features of EHR communication optional rather than mandatory.
   However, some degree of prescription is required to make EHR Extracts
   safely processable by an EHR recipient system. This European Standard
   will, in practice, usually be adopted alongside other health
   informatics standards that define particular aspects of health data
   representation. This European Standard can be used alongside key
   complementary standards, including the [14]Health Level 7 Version 3
   Reference Information Model (RIM), EN 14822-1, EN 14822-2, EN 14822-3,
   CEN/TS 14822-4 (GPIC), prEN 12967 ([15]HISA) and prEN13940
   ([16]CONTSYS).
