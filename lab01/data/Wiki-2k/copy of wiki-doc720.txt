   Earth 2150: The Moon Project is a sequel to the [31]real time strategy
   game [32]Earth 2150. While the game is in fact a stand-alone game, many
   consider it an [33]expansion pack because it does little more than
   provide new missions, and weapons. The story takes place alongside the
   original game's story. The Moon Project was released in [34]2001 by
   [35]Strategic Simulations, Inc.

[[41]edit] Story

   Earth's final war is in full swing. The United Civilized States,
   Eurasian Dynasty, and the Lunar Corporation fight over what is left of
   the worlds resources in order to escape the blue planet before it is
   destroyed. Meanwhile, on the Moon, the Lunar Corporation discovers the
   remnants of an alien tunnel system. In it, they find the plans for an
   orbital super weapon, with the power to attack the Earth from the Moon.
   While beginning the process of building the weapon, code named
   "Sunlight", a United Civilized States army appears ready to try and
   stop them. It's up to the player to decide how it will play out, and
   who will win.

[[42]edit] Gameplay

   The Moon Project is a war strategy game. What sets it apart from other
   games in the genre, is the full three dimensional play. You can rotate
   the camera to view the battlefield from just about any angle. It also
   includes an [43]experience system for your units, indicated by a green
   and black line under the unit's health bar. Higher levels means higher
   damage, health, and armor. You must mine resources in order to build
   units and structures, and must create power plants to keep your
   structures working. The game includes a 10 level campaign for each
   faction, and multiplayer support is provided.

[[44]edit] The Factions

   The game includes three playable factions. Each has its own unique
   style and army.

   United Civilized States: UCS for short, consists of the American
   continents. Their society relies heavily on machinery and [45]robotics,
   and is ruled by an [46]Artificial Intelligence. Machines do all tasks
   for the people and as a result the population is lazy and hedonistic.
   Their army consists of [47]Mecha without human pilots. When playing as
   the UCS, the player takes the role of a commander working for the
   President but more directly to GOLAN and another AI called Neo. The UCS
   has long been at war with the Eurasian Dynasty. The main weapon of the
   UCS is the [48]Plasma Cannon and the larger Heavy Plasma Cannons. While
   very powerful, shields can stop plasma before it can make it to the
   hull of target vehicles.

   Eurasion Dynasty: ED for short, controls Europe and Asia. They are
   ruled by a descendent of [49]Genghis Khan and seem to follow old Soviet
   ideology. They are somewhat primitive (by 22nd Century standards) at
   first, relying on 21st century vehicles and weapons, such as tanks and
   helicopters. They do however have some advanced technology in the form
   of the [50]Laser cannon and the [51]Ion cannon. The ED dual 120 cannons
   are very powerful and can also punch through shields, a very useful
   property in the end game.

   Lunar Corporation: LC for short, are descendants of lunar colonists.
   Since 2084, they severed contact with the Earth when it became apparent
   that a full-scale nuclear war was about to occur. Since then they have
   lived peacefully on the Moon. Because of their isolation from the wars
   of Earth, their society has evolved into a pacifist form. The
   technologies of the LC are far more advanced than that of the other two
   factions. The main weapon platform of the LC is the hovercraft. Not
   having been at war for many years; the LC military machine is almost
   non-existent. They catch on quickly however, and build some of the more
   exotic weapons of the game including the [52]Electro-cannon, which
   emits an electrical pulse to destroy targets, and the [53]Sonic cannon,
   which emits a moderately powerful radial effect that damages all
   enemies around it. Another thing to note is that the LC is comprised
   mostly of females.

[[54]edit] The game

   The game plays nearly the same as [55]Earth 2150 with a few key
   differences:

   1. Both LC and UCS campaigns take place on the Moon, with the exception
   of the first UCS level.

   2. Several new vehicles and weapons have been added to the game
   including mobile transports, Artillery, antimissile systems which fire
   automatically in order to take down incoming enemy missiles and
   "Anti-air" weapons (ED: AA Gun, UCS: AA Plasma Cannon, LC: AA Rocket
   Launcher), which do incredible amounts of damage to aircraft.

   3. The ED campaign introduces an "Advancement system" which allows you
   to gain rank (and a [56]cut-scene) upon earning a certain amount of
   points, which are received when objectives are met in missions.

   4. The shield system has been changed to even out the defense
   capabilities of the 3 factions. The power of the shields has been
   halved.

   5. The campaign no longer revolves around sending resources to your
   home base for the construction of an evacuation fleet. Instead, all the
   resources on the map are added to your home base funds when you
   successfully destroy all enemy units in the mission and return to your
   base. Unlike the first game, which required careful conservation of
   resources to complete a mission and the game, funds are nearly
   unlimited on each mission.
