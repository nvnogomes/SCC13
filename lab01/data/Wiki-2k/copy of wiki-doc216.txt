   id Tech 4, formerly known as the Doom 3 engine, is a computer [27]game
   engine developed by [28]id Software and first used in the [29]PC game
   [30]Doom 3. The engine was designed by [31]John Carmack, who also
   created previous engines such as those for [32]Doom and [33]Quake,
   which are also generally recognized as marking significant advances in
   the field.

[[44]edit] History

   id Tech 4 began as an enhancement to [45]id Tech 3. Originally it was
   planned to be a complete rewrite of the engine's [46]renderer, while
   still retaining other subsystems, such as file access, and memory
   management. After the new renderer was functional, however, the
   decision was made to switch from [47]C to the [48]C++ [49]programming
   language, necessitating a complete restructuring and rewrite of the
   rest of the engine; today, while id Tech 4 contains code from id Tech
   3, much of it has had to be rewritten.

   Like its predecessors, id Tech 4 will eventually be released as
   [50]open source. At the [51]QuakeCon 2007, [52]John Carmack the lead
   graphics engine developer at id, said to [53]LinuxGames: "I mean I
   won't commit to a date, but the Doom 3 stuff will be open source."
   ^[54][4]

[[55]edit] Hardware

   The requirement of id Tech 4 was that it needed a high-end graphics
   processing unit (GPU), which was at least DirectX 8.0 compliant with
   [56]fully programmable vertex and pixel shaders, such as the [57]Nvidia
   [58]GeForce 3 or [59]ATI [60]Radeon 8500, with at least 64 MB of VRAM.
   By E3 2002, the recommended GPU was the [61]Radeon 9700 with 128 VRAM;
   while its DirectX 9.0 features are not necessary to render the game,
   its advanced architecture, 256-bit memory bus, and efficiency were
   needed to run Doom 3 at high detail and playable speed.[62][1]

   id Tech 4 resulted in the obsolescence of DirectX 7.0 graphics chips
   such as the widespread [63]GeForce 2 and [64]Radeon 7200, as well as
   DirectX 6.0 chipsets such as [65]RIVA TNT2 and [66]Rage 128, and
   software rendering (with an integrated [67]Intel GMA). Until the advent
   of id Tech 4, a powerful CPU was able to somewhat compensate for an
   older video card. While [68]John Carmack initially warned gamers not to
   purchase the [69]GeForce 4 MX (which casual consumers often confused
   with the DirectX 8.0 GeForce 4 Ti, though it was at best an improved
   DirectX 7.0 [70]GeForce 2), its somewhat widespread adoption compelled
   id Software to enable Doom 3 to run on these cards, making it the only
   DirectX 7.0 chip capable of doing so. There have been cases of
   enthusiasts forcing [71]Doom 3 to run on unsupported graphics chips,
   such as the long obsolete [72]Voodoo 2, but these are unable to render
   the per-pixel lighting and bump mapping.[73][2]

[[74]edit] Features

   The shadowing effects of the Unified lighting and shadowing engine are
   shown on the face and body of the zombies in this screenshot of Doom 3

[[75]edit] Graphics

   The id Tech 4 added several new graphical features absent in its
   predecessor, [76]id Tech 3. These included [77]bump mapping, [78]normal
   mapping, and [79]specular highlighting. More features were added in the
   development of successive games, and in yet unreleased games using id
   Tech 4, new features have been added or are planned to be added soon.

   The primary innovation of id Tech 4 was its use of entirely dynamic
   [80]per-pixel lighting, whereas previously, 3D engines had relied
   primarily on pre-calculated per-vertex lighting or [81]lightmaps and
   [82]Gouraud shading. While dynamic effects had been available before
   (such as dynamic moving lights), this effect merely changed the
   brightness of the vertices of the polygon, with the pixel's colors
   simply being interpolated between the three vertex colors of its
   polygon. The approach used in Doom 3 permitted more realistic lighting
   and shadows^[83][5] that just had been introduced in video
   games^[84][6].

[[85]edit] Games using or licensing id Tech 4

   Unlike the preceding and widely-used [86]id Tech 3 (Quake III Engine)
   and [87]id Tech 2 (Quake II Engine), id Tech 4 has had somewhat less
   success in licensing to third parties. This is especially apparent in
   comparison to its closest competitor, the [88]Unreal 3 engine. The
   unexpected long development time going into id Tech 4 did not help, as
   between 2002-2004, id Software had no equivalent to the [89]Unreal 2
   engine. Many who licensed the Unreal 2 engine were thus able to make
   the switch to Unreal 3 more easily.

   While id Tech 4 had taken a new direction with its dynamic
   [90]per-pixel lighting, this unconventional feature had steeper
   hardware requirements and was initially only useful in "spooky games"
   (until the [91]MegaTexture addition), whereas an increasing number of
   developers preferred conventional engines that could render large
   outdoor areas. Also notable was id Tech 4's relative lack of
   scalability compared to competing FPS engines which would have limited
   its potential audience; the [92]Source Engine could still run on the
   older widespread DirectX 7 GPUs albeit without shaders being used.

[[105]edit] MegaTexture rendering technology

          Main article: [106]MegaTexture

   The original version of the id Tech 4 engine was criticized for its
   perceived inability to handle large outdoor areas. The MegaTexture
   technology addresses this issue by introducing a means to create
   expansive outdoor scenes. By painting a single massive texture
   (32,76832,768 [107]pixels, though it has been extended to larger
   dimensions in recent versions of the MegaTexture technology) covering
   the entire polygon map and highly detailed terrain, the desired effects
   can be achieved. The MegaTexture can also store physical information
   about the terrain such as the amount of traction in certain areas or
   indicate what sound effect should be played when walking over specific
   parts of the map. i.e. walking on rock will sound different from
   walking on grass.^[108][7] It is expected that this will result in a
   considerably more detailed scene than the majority of existing
   technologies, using tiled textures, allow. Currently, the only game
   that utilizes MegaTexture based on the Tech 4 engine is [109]Enemy
   Territory: Quake Wars.
