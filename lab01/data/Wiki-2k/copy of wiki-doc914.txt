   The Education of Henry Adams records the struggle of Bostonian
   [14]Henry Adams (1838-1918), in early old age, to come to terms with
   the dawning 20th century, so different from the world of his youth. It
   is also a sharp critique of 19th century [15]educational theory and
   practice. In 1907, Adams began privately circulating copies of a
   limited edition printed at his own expense. Commercial publication had
   to await its author's 1918 death, whereupon it won the [16]1919
   Pulitzer Prize.

[[23]edit] Subject

   The Education is much more a record of Adams's introspection than of
   his deeds. It is an extended meditation on the social, technological,
   political, and intellectual changes that occurred over Adams's
   lifetime. Adams concluded that his traditional education failed to help
   him come to terms with these rapid changes; hence his need for
   [24]self-education. The organizing thread of the book is how the
   "proper" schooling and other aspects of his youth, was time wasted;
   thus his search for self-education through experiences, friendships,
   and reading. Henry Adams had attended Harvard College.

   Many aspects of the contemporary world emerged during the half-century
   between the [25]Civil War and [26]World War I, a half-century
   coinciding with Adams's adult life. An important theme of The Education
   is its author's bewilderment and concern at the rapid advance in
   [27]science and [28]technology over the course of his lifetime,
   sometimes now called [29]Second Industrial Revolution but incarnated in
   his term "[30]dynamo." The Education mentions the recent discovery of
   [31]x-rays and [32]radioactivity, and shows a familiarity with
   [33]radio waves in his citation of Marconi and [34]Branly. Adams
   purchased an automobile as early as 1902, in order to make better use
   of a summer in France researching Mont Saint Michel and Chartres. He
   correctly predicted that the 20th century would see even more explosive
   changes. Adams repeatedly laments that his formal education, grounded
   in the classics, history, and literature, as was then the fashion, did
   not give him the scientific and mathematical knowledge needed to grasp
   the scientific breakthroughs of the 1890s and 1900s.

   Two aspects set The Education apart from the common run of
   autobiographies. First, it is narrated in the third person; second, it
   is frequently sarcastic and humorously self-critical.

   The Education repeatedly mentions two long-standing friends of Adams,
   the scientific explorer of the Far West, [35]Clarence King, and the
   American diplomat, [36]John Milton Hay.

   The Education does not discuss Adams's marriage, and the illness and
   1885 suicide of his wife, [37]Clover. Adams, splendidily reflective and
   self-critical in so many other ways, did not articulate what, if
   anything, he had learned from these sobering experiences. But he did,
   in fact, speak to his marriage in indirect ways. For example, he
   lamented how the memorial he had constructed for his wife had become
   something of a tourist attraction. More generally, it is clear that his
   outlook changed after her death.

[[38]edit] Context

   Henry Adams' life story is rooted in the American political aristocracy
   that emerged from the [39]American Revolution. He was the grandson of
   the [40]American President [41]John Quincy Adams and great-grandson of
   President and Founding Father [42]John Adams. His father, [43]Charles
   Francis Adams, had served as ambassador to the United Kingdom during
   the [44]American Civil War, and had been elected to the [45]United
   States House of Representatives. His brother [46]Brooks Adams was also
   a historian and social critic of note. Henry Adams had received the
   finest formal education available in America, enjoying many other
   advantages as well. It is this social context that makes The Education
   so important. But the trappings of success did not mean much to a
   restless individualist such as Adams. Rather than take advantage of his
   patrician name, he sized up this and other advantages and found them
   wanting.

[[47]edit] Assessment

   The Education is an important work of [48]American literary nonfiction,
   along with [49]Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, and the journals of
   [50]Lewis and Clark. It provides a penetrating glimpse into the
   intellectual and political life of the late 19th century [51]United
   States, without being mired in apologetics, like [52]Ulysses S. Grant's
   autobiography.

   The Education ranked first on the [53]Modern Library's 1998 [54]list of
   100 Best Nonfiction Books and also was nominated as the [55]best book
   of the twentieth century several years later by the [56]Intercollegiate
   Studies Institute.

   [57]Homeschoolers and [58]unschoolers value The Education because it
   makes a strong case against the regimented [59]Prussian-style schooling
   used by [60]American and [61]European school systems. He preferred a
   self-directed approach of a kind that had predominated before 1850 and
   that relied on reading, discussion, reflection, and experience.

[[80]edit] Quotations

   [81]Sister project [82]Wikiquote has a collection of quotations related
   to: [83]Henry Adams
     * Chaos often breeds life, when order breeds [84]habit.

     * The [85]Ego has ... become a manikin on which the toilet of
       education is to be draped in order to show the fit or misfit of the
       clothes. The object of study is the garment, not the figure.

     * Chaos was the law of nature; Order was the dream of man.

     * Practical politics consists of ignoring facts.

     * Politics, as a practice, whatever its professions, has always been
       the systematic organization of hatreds.

     * No mind is so well balanced as to bear the strain of seizing
       unlimited force without habit or knowledge of it; and finding it
       disputed with him by hungry packs of wolves and hounds whose lives
       depend on snatching the carrion.

     * Nothing in education is so astonishing as the amount of ignorance
       it accumulates in the form of inert facts.

     * From cradle to grave this problem of running order through chaos,
       direction through space, discipline through freedom, unity through
       multiplicity, has always been, and must always be, the task of
       education, as it is the moral of religion, philosophy, science,
       art, politics and economy; but a boy's will is his life, and he
       dies when it is broken, as the colt dies in harness, taking a new
       nature in becoming tame.
