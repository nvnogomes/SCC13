   East Claydon is a [44]village and is also a [45]civil parish within
   [46]Aylesbury Vale district in [47]Buckinghamshire, [48]England. It is
   about two and a half miles south west of [49]Winslow.

   The village name 'Claydon' is [50]Anglo Saxon in origin, and derives
   from the old English clgig + dun meaning 'clay hill'. The affix 'East'
   is used to differentiate the village from nearby [51]Steeple Claydon
   and [52]Middle Claydon, and from the [53]hamlet of [54]Botolph Claydon
   that lies within the [55]parish of East Claydon.

   The rural village of around 60 houses currently includes a primary
   school and a volunteer-run pub and also features a distinctive thatched
   tree known locally as 'The Mushroom Tree' with seating around the base.
   The village hall has a bell tower, the bell of which is known as 'the
   mushroom', in reference to its shape.^[[56]citation needed] This is
   also reflected in the name of the pub 'The Mushroom
   Club'.^[[57]citation needed]

   The parish church dedicated to [58]St Mary was demolished during the
   [59]English Civil War by [60]Cornelius Holland ^[61][2]^[62][3], one of
   [63]King Charles's judges, but was rebuilt after the [64]restoration.
   The current structure is largely of 18th century design, but comprises
   components from various centuries, the earliest of which is the 13th
   century.

   East Claydon School School is a mixed, [65]community, infant school,
   which takes children from the age of four through to the age of seven,
   when they generally move to a school in [66]Steeple Claydon or
   [67]Winslow. The school is quite small, with approximately thirty
   pupils.
