   Durham White Stevens ([17]February 1, [18]1851, [19]Washington, D.C.
   [20]March 25, [21]1908, [22]San Francisco, [23]California) was an
   [24]American diplomat and later an employee of [25]Japan's [26]Ministry
   of Foreign Affairs.^[27][2] His shooting death at the hands of
   [28]Korean American assassins [29]Jang In-hwan and [30]Jeon Myeong-un
   led to his being described as "the first victim of [31]Korean
   terrorism".^[32][3]

[[42]edit] Early life and career

   Stevens grew up in [43]Washington, D.C. He enrolled as an undergraduate
   at [44]Ohio's [45]Oberlin College, from which he graduated in 1871; he
   then returned to his hometown to study law at [46]Columbian University
   and [47]Howard University , and was admitted to the [48]bar association
   of the District of Columbia in 1873.^[49][4] His career with the
   [50]Department of State began in October of that same year, when
   [51]President [52]Ulysses S. Grant appointed him secretary of the
   United States Legation at [53]Tokyo, where he served under then-United
   States minister to Japan [54]John Bingham.^[55][5] He enthusiastically
   accepted his new position, in part due to his fondness for learning new
   languages; he had previously studied Latin, Greek, French, and German.
   He was initially one of only three staff members at the
   Legation.^[56][6] He served as secretary until July 1883, and also took
   up the post of Charge d'Affairs ad interim in 1878-79, while Bingham
   was on home leave. After resigning his post, he returned to the United
   States.^[57][5]^[58][7]

[[59]edit] Working for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs

   In November 1883, Stevens entered the service of the Japanese
   Government as English Secretary to the Imperial Legation at Washington,
   a position which he obtained thanks to the influence his former
   superior Bingham had with the Japanese government.^[60][8] In 1884 he
   was ordered to Tokyo for service in the Foreign Office. In the winter
   of 1884-85 he accompanied Count [61]Inoue Kaoru to Korea to assist in
   negotiations related to the murder of several Japanese citizens on
   Korean soil; for services rendered on that occasion, the [62]Emperor
   Meiji awarded him with the [63]Third Class of the Order of the Rising
   Sun.^[64][5] He was Bureau du Protocole of an 1885-87 Tokyo conference
   aimed at the renegotiation of [65]unequal treaties imposed on Japan by
   Western countries; following the conference, he returned to Washington,
   D.C. with the rank of Honorary Counsellor of Legation. He served under
   Count [66]Mutsu Munemitsu, then-Minister at Washington; during that
   time, he assisted in the negotiation of the treaty with Mexico, which
   was the first treaty made by Japan fully recognizing her right to
   exercise all the sovereign powers of an independent state.^[67][9]

   Soon after the start of hostilities in the [68]First Sino-Japanese War,
   Stevens published an article in the [69]North American Review, in which
   he sought to justify the war by asserting that the "dry rot of Chinese
   conservatism" blocked Korea's development, and that a reduction of
   Chinese influence in Korea and a corresponding increase in Japanese
   power would result in social and commercial reform.^[70][10] For
   services rendered during the war, he received the Second Class of the
   [71]Order of the Sacred Treasures. He travelled twice to [72]Hawaii to
   represent Japanese interests there, once in 1901 and again in 1902. He
   was also decorated two more times by the Japanese government, the third
   time receiving the Second Class of the Order of the Rising Sun, and
   then in October 1904, the fourth time, being awarded the Grand Cross of
   the Sacred Treasure.^[73][9]^[74][11]

[[75]edit] Adviser to the Korean government

   In November 1904, Stevens was appointed as adviser to the Korean
   Foreign Office.^[76][11] The Japanese government had urged the Korean
   government to appoint him to this position on the basis of the 1901
   recommendation of [77]Horace Allen. Stevens ignored several requests
   that a Korean consul be appointed in Hawaii; despite this, in 1905,
   Allen also commended Stevens to [78]F.M. Swanzy, president of the
   [79]Hawaii Sugar Planters' Association; Swanzy was interested in seeing
   [80]Korean emigration to [81]Hawaii restarted. The Japanese government
   expected that Stevens supported their efforts to block Korean
   emigration to Hawaii, but he was initially open to the idea. He had
   several meetings with Swanzy in Tokyo in mid-1905 on the subject, but
   in the end, Swanzy's efforts were unsuccessful.^[82][12] Later that
   year, he issued a statement that Japan would welcome legislation
   restricting the entry of Japanese immigrants into the United States,
   and that they were also in favor of stopping movement to Hawaii,
   "provided it can be done in a manner that would not be offensive to
   Japan or that would not affect her dignity"; he stated that the
   Japanese government hoped to induce potential emigrants to settle in
   Korea or [83]northeast China instead.^[84][13] While officially under
   the employ of the Joseon government, he continued to receive tens of
   thousands of dollars in payments from the Japanese in order to "advance
   Japanese propaganda" among the American people, according to South
   Korea's [85]Ministry of Patriots' and Veterans' Affairs.^[86][14]

   In early 1906, Stevens made a bet with [87]Kiuchi Jshir, a Japanese
   official resident in Korea, about the length of time before Japan would
   annex Korea. Kiuchi expected it would only take three years; Stevens'
   guess of five years would prove to be more nearly correct, as the
   [88]Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty was signed in mid-1910.^[89][15]
   However, Stevens would not survive to see his prediction come true.

[[90]edit] Assassination

   Stevens returned to the United States in March 1908 to visit his family
   in Washington, D.C. and vacation with his sisters at a cottage they
   owned in [91]Atlantic City, [92]New Jersey.^[93][16] Upon his arrival,
   he gave an interview with a San Francisco newspaper in which he stated
   that the common people of Korea welcomed the increasing Japanese
   presence in their country. These statements provoked the ire of two
   local associations of Koreans, the Daedong Bogukhoe and the Gongnip
   Hyeophoe, who held a joint meeting in which they agreed that something
   had to be done about Stevens.^[94][17] On [95]March 22, [96]1908, four
   Korean men chosen by the associations accosted Stevens at the
   [97]Fairmont Hotel, where he was staying. Their leader, a man by the
   name of Earl Lee who was described as fluent in English, asked him if
   he had indeed made the statements attributed to him in the newspaper,
   and whether "Japanese were not killing off the Koreans". When he
   answered yes to the first question and no to the second, the four men
   began to strike Stevens with chairs, knocking him down and causing him
   to strike his head against the marble flooring; Stevens backed up
   against the wall until help arrived. After the assault, Lee was quoted
   as saying, "We are all very sorry that we did not do more to
   him."^[98][16]

   The following day, [99]Jang In-hwan and [100]Jeon Myeong-un, both
   [101]Korean immigrants to the United States, approached Stevens at the
   [102]Port of San Francisco as he prepared catch a ferry to make a rail
   connection in [103]Oakland and attacked him. Jeon fired his
   [104]revolver at Stevens first, but missed, and instead rushed at him,
   using his weapon [105]as a club to hit Stevens in the face. Jang then
   fired into the melee, striking Stevens twice in the back; Jeon was also
   shot in the confusion. The crowd which had gathered urged that they be
   [106]lynched on the spot; Jang was arrested and held without bail on a
   charge of murder, while Jeon was first hospitalized, and later charged
   as an [107]accessory. In newspaper interviews after the attack, both
   Jeon and Jang offered no apology for the assassination, describing
   Stevens as a "traitor to Korea" and stating that "thousands of people
   have been killed through his plans". ^[108][18]

   One bullet had penetrated Stevens' lung, while another lodged in his
   groin; however, surgeons at the St. Francis Hospital initially expected
   that he would be able to make a recovery, and on the day of the attack
   he was apparently in good enough health to issue a statement to the
   press that the assault was "evidently the work of a small band of
   student agitators in and about San Francisco, who resent the fact that
   the Japanese have a protectorate over Korea and believe that I am to
   some extent responsible for this condition of affairs in their
   country".^[109][16] However, his condition began to deteriorate on the
   morning of [110]March 25. His doctors, seeing signs of inflammation in
   his wounds, placed him under anaesthesia and began to perform surgery
   at six that evening. He never regained consciousness after that, and
   died shortly after 11 PM, with Japanese Consul [111]Chozo Koike at his
   bedside.^[112][19] He was buried in his hometown of Washington, D.C.
   after a funeral service at [113]St. John's Episcopal Church;
   [114]Secretary of State [115]Elihu Root was among his
   [116]pallbearers.^[117][18]

[[118]edit] Reaction to death

   News of Stevens' assassination was greeted with sorrow in diplomatic
   circles in Japan and among American missionaries in Korea, to whom
   Stevens was well-known; United States Ambassador to Japan [119]Thomas
   O'Brien was quoted as saying that "the utmost grief is expressed by
   everyone", adding that he counted Stevens as a "true and useful
   friend".^[120][19] [121]Yale University professor [122]George Trumbull
   Ladd, in a [123]letter to the editor of [124]The New York Times,
   denounced the attacks as "cowardly and shockingly brutal", calling
   Koreans a "bloody race" and, comparing the Stevens case to a number of
   other assaults in Korea, such as that against American missionary
   [125]George Heber Jones, concluded that politically-motivated murders
   were not "an isolated or at all peculiar experience" in Korea, and
   stated that the events "furnish an instructive object lesson for the
   correct estimation of the Korean character and the Korean method of
   self-government".^[126][20]

   Jang and Jeon both stood trial for Stevens' murder separately, as there
   was insufficient evidence to prove they had conspired with each other;
   Jeon was quickly acquitted of charges.^[127][17] The Korean community
   hired three lawyers to defend Jang, among whom one, [128]Nathan
   Coughlan, eventually agreed to take on the case [129]pro bono. During
   the trial, he planned to use [130]Arthur Schopenhauer's theory of
   "patriotic insanity" to argue that Jang was [131]not guilty by reason
   of insanity.^[132][21]^[133][18] The jury found Jang guilty of
   [134]second-degree murder on [135]23 December of that same
   year.^[136][22] Later Korean accounts describe Stevens as a traitor to
   Korea and refer to Jeon and Jang as patriots and heroes.^[137][21]
