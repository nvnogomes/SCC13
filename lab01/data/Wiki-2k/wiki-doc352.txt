[[51]edit] Education

   Sant graduated from the [52]University of Malta as Bachelor of Science
   in Physics and Mathematics in 1967 and as Master of Science in Physics
   in the following year. He studied public administration in 1970 at
   Institut International d'Administration Publique at the [53]cole
   Nationale d'Administration (ENA) in [54]Paris and holds a Master of
   Business Management (with honors) from [55]Boston University Graduate
   School of Management (specialising in international business and
   business policy) and a Doctor of Business Administration from
   [56]Harvard University.

[[57]edit] Career

   Sant served as Second, and then First Secretary at the Malta Mission to
   the European Communities in Brussels between 1970 and 1975 when he
   resigned to undertake full-time studies in the USA. Between 1977 and
   1978 on his return to Malta Sant served as advisor on general and
   financial management at the Ministry of Parastatal and People's
   Industries and between 1978 and 1980 he served as the Managing Director
   of Medina Consulting Group. Sant returned to the public sector in 1980
   as Executive Deputy Chairman with the Malta Development Corporation.

[[58]edit] Politics

   Sant's first political post with the [59]Labour Party was as chairman
   of its Department of Information (1982-92). During this time he also
   served as President of the Party (1984-88). He served a stint as the
   editor of the Party weekly Il-elsien (1987-88).

   Sant first stood for election in 1987; although he was unsuccessful, he
   was co-opted to Parliament later that year. In 1992, following the
   resignation of [60]Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, he was elected as Party
   leader.

[[61]edit] 22-month government (1996-98)

   The [62]Labour Party (PL) won the October 1996 elections under Sant who
   successfully campaigned for the removal of the [63]Value Added Tax
   (VAT) that had been introduced in 1995. A year after taking office the
   PL under Sant replaced VAT by a similar [64]indirect tax, the Customs
   and Excise Tax (CET).

   Alfred Sant's tenure as Prime Minister lasted only 22 months. Enjoying
   only a one-seat majority the Government was vulnerable to threats from
   former Prime Minister and Labour leader [65]Dom Mintoff. Things came to
   a head in the summer of 1998 when a row with Mintoff over a coastal
   concession to a private company resulted in Government being defeated
   over the motion transferring the land. Sant felt that, in the
   circumstances, the government's parliamentary majority was compromised
   and asked the President to dissolve the House. In the subsequent
   elections held in September 1998 the [66]Labour Party was defeated and
   returned into opposition.

[[67]edit] 2003 Referendum and election

   Sant campaigned heavily against Malta's [68]European Union membership.
   During the run-up to the March 2003 referendum, Sant was also critical
   of what he called a "sham referendum" insisting that a general election
   alone would settle the EU membership issue. He called on Labour
   supporters to either vote No, abstain or invalidate their vote. He
   himself abstained.

   The Yes side won the referendum by a 54% to 46% margin but Sant claimed
   to have won the referendum as the Yes vote was less than half of
   registered voters. In view of the lack of consensus on the
   interpretation of the result, Prime Minister [69]Eddie Fenech Adami
   asked the President to dissolve Parliament and call fresh elections.
   These were held in April 2003 and the [70]Labour Party was again
   defeated at the polls.

   Sant tendered his resignation as party leader. He did, however, stand
   for election for Party leader again which was contested by two other
   candidates for the post, [71]John Attard Montalto and [72]Angelo
   Farrugia. Sant was re-elected party leader with 66% of votes cast by
   Labour Party delegates and returned to lead the Party.

[[73]edit] 2008 general election

   The [74]Labour Party, spearheaded by Sant, presented a new programme
   Pjan gal bidu did (Plan for a new beginning) and called for Bonn ta'
   Bidla (The need for a Change) after the 20 years (save for his brief
   stint from 1996 to 1998) of [75]Partit Nazzjonalista government. The
   electoral-programme contained references to overhauls in the
   educational system (which proved to be extremely controversial),
   reduction of an electricity [76]surcharge by half and tax holidays on
   overtime work.

   Sant was defeated for the third consecutive time, this time by [77]Dr.
   Lawrence Gonzi (Partit Nazzjonalista) in the [78]2008 general election.
   This election was lost by the PL on a slim margin of 1580 votes,
   effectively wiping out the previous Nationalist majority, even if the
   PL failed to seriously increase its voter backing. Following the loss
   of the election, Sant resigned as leader of the [79]Labour Party on 10
   March 2008, and as Leader of the Opposition on 5 June 2008; he was
   succeeded as PL leader by [80]Joseph Muscat and as Leader of the
   Opposition by Dr [81]Charles Mangion. Sant retained his Parliamentary
   seat.

[[82]edit] Literary and journalism

   Dr Sant is an established writer (of both novels and short stories) and
   playwright and has published several books. His published works include
   the collected plays Min Hu Evelyn Costa?, "Kwart ta' mija" -- a
   collection of short stories, the novels L-Ewwel Weraq tal-Bajtar, Sil
   fuq Kemmuna, Fid-dell tal-Katidral , Qabel tifta l-inkjesta and "La
   bidu la tmiem". His non-fiction works include Bejg u Xiri, L-Impenn
   gall-Bidla, (a collection of essays) and the political chronicle "28
   ta' April, 1958", "Malta's European Challenge" and the autobiographical
   "Confessions of a European Maltese".

   Sant was also the editor Tomorrow, a monthly English language magazine
   (1982-1985) and of Society, a quarterly opinions magazine, apart from
   authoring numerous articles. Sant also contributed regularly to the
   [83]General Workers' Union's Sunday, Maltese language newspaper It-Tora
   until his Party's defeat at the polls in March 2008.

[[84]edit] Illness

   In December 2007 Sant was admitted to hospital where, it was later
   announced, he was treated for colon cancer. In January 2008 it was
   announced in a Labour Party conference that Alfred Sant was recovering
   well from surgery and was fit to remain leader of the PL.
