Dragon's Gate

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Dragon's Gate was an interactive, real time, [8]text-based [9]multi
   user online [10]fantasy role-playing game, sometimes referred to as a
   [11]MUD. It was one of the longest running pay-for-play [12]online
   games in the world, it opened to the public in the spring of 1991 on
   [13]GEnie. In the summer of 1996 the game was moved to [14]AOL. Later
   the game was moved again to Mythic Realms, and most recently as an
   independent server.

[[19]edit] History

   At its creation, the core of Dragon's Gate was based on the
   AUSI-entitled game Aradath, which was designed in 1985 by [20]Mark
   Jacobs. Jacobs, along with partner Rob Denton, later formed a company
   in 1995 called [21]Interworld Productions, which in 1997 was re-named
   as [22]Mythic Entertainment. [23]Mythic Entertainment is currently best
   known for the [24]MMORPG [25]Warhammer Online.

   In June 20, 2006 [26]Mythic Entertainment was purchased by
   [27]Electronic Arts^[28][1].

   On January 31, 2006, [29]Mythic Entertainment dropped a number of games
   from its services and official sponsoring, including Dragon's Gate.
   Currently, the game server is offline entirely, and as such, Dragon's
   Gate is no longer accepting new members and can no longer be connected
   via telnet to play what was formally a [30]MUD. Recently, as said per
   the official [31]message boards, the game has been "closed... at least
   for now."^[32][2]

[[33]edit] Production overview

   Like other games of its kind, Dragon's Gate was based on ideas similar
   to popular fantasy stories (such as [34]The Lord of the Rings and
   [35]Dungeons & Dragons). Each player created a character and assumed
   the identity of that character while participating. [36]Role-playing
   allowed interaction between PCs ([37]player characters) and NPCs
   ([38]non-player characters in the form of computer controlled creatures
   including monsters and merchants among others) within a simulated
   environment, which runs in a real-time framework, allowing for an
   extremely immersive experience. Among the possible game events are
   numerous GM ([39]game master) or player-run scenarios which variously
   consist of adventuring, completing quests, fighting in gladiatoral
   sports, and making new friends with other players.

   A [40]player character could be comprised of any one of several classes
   and races and be individualized in many ways, similar to more modern
   [41]MMORPGs. Throughout the gaming process, players quickly learned
   about the way the world functions and how to adventure (usually in
   search of things like loot, glory, fame, and fortune) either alone or
   with other players. The game is specifically designed to emphasize its
   [42]role-playing aspects, and to this end the developers have
   de-emphasized the statistics; although they are still an integral part
   of the way the game works, and some statistics with numbers are still
   shown, but are kept to an absolute minimum. Life in the game continues
   24 hours a day, and events continue to occur without requiring the
   direct intervention of players, a concept commonly referred to as
   "persistence."

   According to the official website: "The world is rich with political
   and religious strife and has a detailed history. It is very easy to get
   involved and immersed in [43]role-play. Dragon's Gate allows you to
   experience an exciting world designed to be more than just a [44]text
   adventure. As a social gaming system, Dragon's Gate is intended to be
   fun.
