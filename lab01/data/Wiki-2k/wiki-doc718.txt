[[68]edit] Career

[[69]edit] Early years

   Band leader and founder [70]Maurice White was born in [71]Memphis,
   Tennessee, in 1941 to a father who was a doctor and an occasional
   saxophonist. He was a childhood friend of Booker T Jones. In his
   teenage years he moved to [72]Chicago and found work as a [73]session
   drummer for [74]Chess Records. In 1962, along with other studio
   musicians at Chess, he was a member of the Jazzmen, who later became
   the [75]Pharaohs. By [76]1966 he was the new [77]drummer in the
   [78]Ramsey Lewis Trio, replacing Isaac 'Red' Holt and bassist
   [79]Cleveland Eaton replacing Eldee Young.[80][7] Holt would go on to
   be a part of the [81]Young-Holt Unlimited. Maurice as part of the
   Ramsey Lewis Trio played on nine of the group's albums which included
   Wade In The Water,[82][8], from which the track Hold It Right There won
   a [83]Grammy Award for Best Rhythm & Blues Group Performance, Vocal Or
   Instrumental [84][9] , Goin' Latin,[85][10] and Dancing in the Street
   [86][11]. While in the Trio he was introduced to the [87]Kalimba by
   Ramsey Lewis[88][12] and the Trio's 1969 album Another Voyage featured
   the first recording of Maurice playing the Kalimba.[89][13] In 1969,
   Maurice left the Ramsey Lewis Trio, and joined two friends in Chicago,
   [90]Wade Flemons and Don Whitehead, as a songwriting team composing
   songs and commercials in the Chicago area. The three friends got a
   recording contract with [91]Capitol, and called themselves the "Salty
   Peppers," and had a marginal hit in the Midwestern area called "La La
   Time."

   The Salty Peppers' second single, "Uh Huh Yeah," didn't fare as well,
   and Maurice decided it was time for a change of location and a change
   in the band's name, which became Earth, Wind & Fire. This was based on
   the fact that White's [92]astrological sign being [93]Sagittarius, had
   a primary [94]elemental quality of [95]Fire but also had [96]seasonal
   qualities which are [97]Earth, and [98]Air, hence the omission of
   water. White recruited Chicago singer Sherry Scott, along with local
   percussionist Phillard Williams, and then asked his younger brother
   Verdine whether he'd like to head out west. [99]Verdine White then
   joined the band in 1970 as their new bassist.

   Maurice held auditions in [100]L.A., adding Michael Beale on
   [101]guitar, Chester Washington on [102]reeds, Leslie Drayton for
   [103]trumpet and initially the group's musical arranger, and trombonist
   Alex Thomas to the lineup. With Wade Flemons playing the electric piano
   and vocals and Verdine on bass, percussion and vocals,a ten member
   Earth, Wind & Fire was born [104][14].

   Their self-titled debut album, [105]Earth, Wind & Fire, was released in
   February 1971 to great critical acclaim, as was November 1971's
   [106]The Need of Love both released on Warner Brothers Records. A
   single, from this album "I Think About Lovin' You" provided EWF with
   their first Top 40 R&B hit. In 1971, the group also performed the
   [107]soundtrack to the [108]Melvin Van Peebles film [109]Sweet
   Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.^[110][1] which was recorded at the
   Paramount Recording Studios on [111]Santa Monica Boulevard.However,
   some members of EWF were restless and the band broke up after having
   been together for less than six months. Maurice White decided to
   re-form the group and he started holding auditions.

[[112]edit] The switch to Columbia/CBS Records

   In 1972, Maurice dissolved the line-up (minus himself and brother
   [113]Verdine White), and added Vocalist [114]Jessica Cleaves, former
   member of the [115]R&B group [116]The Friends of Distinction,
   [117]Ronnie Laws on the [118]flute and the [119]saxophone, [120]Rhythm
   Guitarist [121]Roland Bautista, [122]Keyboardist [123]Larry Dunn,
   [124]Percussionist [125]Ralph Johnson and [126]Vocalist [127]Philip
   Bailey. Warner Brothers did not know how to promote this new combo as
   the only other funk band on their label was [128]Charles Wright & the
   Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band. The band won an audition for managers
   Bob Cavallo and Joe Ruffalo which was successful, and Cavallo's
   management of [129]John Sebastian led to a series of gigs as opening
   act for the popular pop/[130]folk singer. A performance at New York's
   Rockefeller Center introduced EWF to [131]Clive Davis, then President
   of [132]Columbia Records. Davis loved what he saw and bought their
   contract from Warner Brothers.

   In the spring of 1972, EWF headed to the studio to record [133]Last
   Days and Time, their [134]CBS debut. The album featured mostly original
   material, but [135]Philip Bailey had suggested the [136]Pete Seeger
   song, "Where Have All The Flowers Gone," and the group threw in a cover
   of the [137]Bread hit "Make It With You" for good measure.

   The album [138]Head to the Sky, was released in 1973, and with this
   album some personnel changes took place. By this time, Ronnie Laws and
   Roland Bautista had left to pursue new musical opportunities. Philip
   Bailey recommended former [139]East High School classmate Andrew
   Woolfolk, who had been busy in New York studying sax with sax maestro
   [140]Joe Henderson and was on the verge of taking up a career in
   banking when Bailey called. Guitarists Al McKay, who had been
   performing with The Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band, and Johnny Graham,
   from R&B favorites New Birth, rounded out the lineup.

   [141]Head to the Sky yielded the group's first two legitimate hit
   singles: "Evil," co-written by Maurice and Philip, and the title track,
   "Keep Your Head To The Sky," both top 30 R&B and top 60 pop
   charts.^[142][1] It was also certified gold and eventually went
   platinum.[143][15] Jessica Cleaves left the band after the release of
   [144]Head to the Sky.

   In 1974 the album [145]Open Our Eyes was released. This was the group's
   first platinum album, and a major hit.^[146][1] In May 1974, "Mighty
   Mighty" became Earth Wind & Fire's first top 30 hit on the pop charts,
   peaking at #29.^[147][1] Their second hit single ("Devotion") was a
   song with a strong spiritual message.^[148][1] Charles Stepney began
   his work with EW&F as an associate producer of this album on the
   request of Maurice White.[149][16] Stepney had previously worked with
   [150]The Dells,[151]Minnie Riperton and the Ramsey Lewis Trio.[152][17]
   On April 6th 1974 Earth, Wind & Fire performed at the [153]California
   Jam a west coast rock festival which attracted an audience of 200,000.

[[155]edit] EWF Hits (1975-1981)

   Earth, Wind & Fire's true breakthrough came in the form of the 1975
   album [156]That's the Way of the World which was the [157]soundtrack to
   a movie of the same name. In 1974 Earth Wind & Fire worked with
   [158]Sig Shore, the creator of the motion picture [159]Super Fly, on a
   new film about the dark side of the recording industry. That's The Way
   Of The World starred Earth Wind & Fire as "The Group," a new recording
   act. In the film, Harvey Keitel hears "The Group" performing, and
   produces their first album. The film's title is repeated throughout the
   film as a shrug of the shoulders to the music world. Earth Wind & Fire
   performed the songs in the film, and Maurice had a small speaking part
   as leader of "The Group."^[160][1]

   Though the [161]film was not a success, the song "[162]Shining Star"
   became a huge mainstream hit and helped launched the band's career. It
   was the first time that the band could afford a full [163]horn section.
   This album also included the hit songs "Reasons","Happy Feeling," and
   "All About Love," which received constant radio airplay on R&B stations
   and with That's The Way Of The World EWF became the first black act to
   top both the Billboard album and singles charts.^[164][1] [165]link.
   [166]That's The Way Of The World has been inducted into the Grammy Hall
   Of Fame [167]link.

   Starting with That's the Way of the World, the Japenese Artist
   [168]Shusei Nagaoka began doing the artwork and the illustrations for
   several of Earth, Wind & Fire's album covers. [169]link [170]link.
   Maurice's younger brother [171]Fred White who had played in Chicago
   clubs as a drummer with [172]Donny Hathaway and later playing with
   [173]Little Feat joined the group and Ralph Johnson turned to vocals.
   After returning from their first European dates with Santana, CBS
   wanted another album. ^[174][1]

   The band's new album sessions in June of 1975 produced "Sing A Song"
   and "Can't Hide Love," the latter written by Clarence "Skip"
   Scarborough. These songs were included with other studio songs on
   [175]Gratitude, a double set LP comprised mostly of live concert
   material from the "That's the Way Of The World" tour which stayed at
   number one on the pop and R&B charts for three weeks. With the release
   of Gratitude the group's [176]horn section headed by Don Myrick and
   also including Louis Satterfield, both from Maurice's Chicago session
   dates, and Michael Harris, became an integral part of the EWF sound
   being credited on Gratitude.

   Aside from his EWF duties, Maurice created and developed Kalimba
   Productions and had signed two acts - vocalist [177]Deniece Williams,a
   former member of Stevie Wonder's Wonderlove backup group and the r&b
   group [178]The Emotions, who had a run of hits with Volt Records from
   1969 to 1974. Maurice also loaned Earth Wind & Fire's signature
   [179]Phenix HornsDon Myrick on saxophone, Louis Satterfield on
   trombone, Rahmlee Davis and Michael Harris on trumpetsto his other
   production projects, the Emotions, Ramsey Lewis and Deniece Williams.
   Also in 1975 Earth, Wind & Fire won [180]Down Beat magazine's Readers
   Poll for favourite Rock/Blues Group [181]link.

   Earth Wind & Fire released [182]Spirit in October 1976 and the album
   spawned the hit singles Getaway and Saturday Nite. "Getaway", came from
   outside the group as Verdine White heard "Getaway" for the first time
   from someone who was producing [183]Bobbi Humphrey. He thought the song
   would be a good for EWF, and took it into the studio and recorded the
   song.^[184][1] In 1976, after helping co-produce and arrange Earth Wind
   & Fire's [185]Spirit album, Deniece Williams' "This is Niecy" album,
   and The Emotions debut album "Flowers", [186]producer and
   [187]songwriter Charles Stepney died of a [188]heart attack on May
   17th, 1976, in Chicago,Illinois at the age of 43. Maurice then took
   over the production duties of Kalimba Productions for EWF. He was
   survived by his wife Rubie, his three daughters Eibur, Charlene and
   Chante and his parents and brother.[189][18]

   Their concerts during this time were loaded with pyrotechnics, magic,
   laser lights, flying pyramids and levitating guitarists and elaborate
   production tricks that included the entire group ascending in a pyramid
   and a disappearing act which saw EWF literally vanishing from sight.
   Magician [190]Doug Henning directed many of their tours throughout the
   1970s.^[191][1]

   In November 1977, the group released another album, [192]All 'N All
   which had a mystical cover and was contained songs with metaphysical
   themes such as Fantasy and Jupiter. All'n' All has achieved triple
   platinum status. Maurice White in the midst of this started to put on
   the tour some of the acts that he was also producing at the time, such
   as [193]The Emotions, [194]Deneice Williams and [195]Ramsey Lewis.1978
   marked the year wherein EWF picked up three Grammy Awards, the third
   for their version of The Beatles "Got To Get You Into My Life". "Got to
   Get You into My Life" was featured as were the band in the movie, Sgt.
   Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band. The film itself was a commercial
   bomb; however, "Got to Get You into My Life" was the biggest hit from
   the movie's soundtrack. It was also the year that Maurice and managers
   Cavallo and Ruffalo worked out a deal for the launch of ARC (The
   American Recording Company) to be distributed through CBS and the
   creation of two recording studios, George Massenburg/ARC in West Los
   Angeles, and The Complex in Los Angeles. The year ended with another
   hit single, "September" (sometimes called 'Dancing in September"), an
   additional track added to their first of two Greatest Hits albums,
   [196]The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1, released four days prior
   to Thanksgiving (November 23, 1978), and The Best of Earth, Wind &
   Fire, Vol. 1 has been certified as having reached [197]Quintuple
   [198]Platinum status.

   Also Bobby Harris of the [199]Dazz Band at this time requested and got
   Philip Bailey to produce the group's first album, Kinsman Dazz. Bailey
   would co-produce the second album, Dazz, and had a major input into the
   group's vocal arrangements.[200][19] In 1979, the band performed
   "September" and "That's The Way Of The World" at the [201]Music for
   UNICEF Concert, which was broadcast worldwide from the [202]United
   Nations General Assembly for [203]NBC [204]link. They donated their
   royalties from the song to [205]UNICEF.

   1979 saw the release of [206]I Am, the group's ninth album (the seventh
   for Columbia, and the second to be distributed by ARC). Songs from the
   album included "In the Stone", "Can't Let Go", and the much-anticipated
   sad ballad "[207]After the Love Has Gone", which has cracked the number
   2 spot on the [208]Billboard Pop and [209]R&B charts.

   A good portion of 1979 was spend overseas headlining shows in Europe
   and Japan. Mid-'79 saw EWF topping the dance music charts with
   "[210]Boogie Wonderland", produced by Maurice and Al McKay, and
   featuring The Emotions. Verdine White claims that "Boogie Wonderland"
   really was capturing the tail end of the disco era.

   The double-album [211]Faces, the group's tenth album (the eighth for
   Columbia, the third distributed ARC release, and the first double LP
   since late 1975's [212]Gratitude) was released in October 1980 and went
   gold. Maurice White has [213]said that [214]Faces is his [215]favorite
   Earth, Wind & Fire album.[216][20] After the release of this album
   longtime rhythm guitarist Al McKay left the band to pursue production
   interests and was replaced by returning electric guitarist Roland
   Bautista, giving the band a bit of a hard rock feel . [217]Phil Collins
   saw EWF while they were on one of their european tours and came in
   contact with EWF's horn section, where they later worked on
   [218]Genesis songs like "No Reply At All" and "Paperlate," and on his
   solo hits like "I Missed Again" and "Sussudio".

   The platinum [219]Raise!, EWF's eleventh album was released in the fall
   of 1981 and it featured their hit single "Let's Groove", and the Grammy
   Award winning "I Wanna Be With You". On the 30th of October 1981 Earth,
   Wind & Fire appeared at [220]American Bandstand's 30th Anniversary
   Special performing Let's Groove [221]link.

   Powerlight was released in early 1983 and included the hit singles
   "Fall In Love With Me" a number 17 pop hit, and "Side By Side."
   "Powerlight" went gold. Also In 1983, Earth, Wind & Fire contributed
   the song "Dance, Dance, Dance" to the soundtrack of the animated film
   Rock & Rule. White disbanded Earth, Wind & Fire in 1983 after the
   synthesized Electric Universe was released in late 1983 to poor sales
   and reviews. Maurice White attributes the album's lack of success to
   its release so quickly after Powerlight. It was their last release for
   four years.

   During their hiatus, Philip Bailey released his second and most
   successful solo project, the gold album [222]Chinese Wall.[223][21] The
   first single from that [224]Phil Collins produced album, a duet with
   Collins called "[225]Easy Lover", went Gold[226][22] and also number 2
   on the US Billboard Hot 100. The music video of Bailey and Collins
   rehearsing their collaboration hit #1 on MTV's video playlist, and won
   an MTV video music award [227]link. The album also featured the Phoenix
   Horns.[228][23] During this [229]period Bailey also released a number
   of secular and [230]Gospel albums, one of which won him a Grammy for
   Best Male Gospel Performance.[231][24]

   Also, during the hiatus, Verdine White worked behind the scenes,
   writing and directing videos. He produced a [232]Level 42
   album,[233][25] and promoted go-go bands like [234]Trouble Funk and
   [235]E.U.^[236][1] Maurice during this time produced for [237]Barbara
   Streisand and [238]Atlantic Starr and worked with [239]Neil Diamond and
   [240]Cher [241]link and relased a solo album entitled Maurice White in
   1986 that included a cover of [242]"Stand by Me" (song) which went to
   number 6 on the R&B charts and number 11 on the Adult Contemporary
   charts and the album also featured an appearance by [243]Gerald
   Albright [244]link [245]link. A compilation album entitled The
   Collection was released in may of 1986 and this album went to number 5
   on the UK pop charts for two weeks and was certified gold by the
   [246]British Phonographic Industry [247]link [248]link.

[[249]edit] Post-Columbia (1987-2004)

   Earth Wind & Fire star on the [250]Hollywood Walk of Fame

   In 1987, CBS Records convinced Philip Bailey and Maurice White that a
   reunion of Earth Wind & Fire would be beneficial for all parties.
   Verdine White, Ronald Johnson and Andrew Woofolk would also return and
   new to the group was guitarist/vocalist [251]Sheldon Reynolds, and a
   new horn section dubbed the Earth, Wind and Fire Horns made up of Gary
   Bias(saxophone) , Ray Brown (trumpet and flugelhorn) and Reggie Young
   (trombone). The band's reunion fostered the 1987 Gold album Touch the
   World, an album that brought forth the hit single penned by a unknown
   songwriter, Skylark "System Of Survival," which reached number one on
   the Billboard R&B charts and Dance charts,and a number one and number 3
   hit single on the R&B and Dance charts "Thinking Of
   You".[252][26]^[253][1] The album went onto number 3 on the Top
   R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 33 on the pop charts.[254][27]

   The band continued to release new albums, including 1988's Gold album
   [255]The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 2.[256][28] Their final

   with [258]Sly Stone.[259][29] 1993 saw the Warner Bros. release
   Millennium. The song "Sunday Morning" from Millennium was nominated for
   a Grammy Award.^[260][1] The album also featured the [261]Prince
   written track superhero.[262][30]

   On July 30, 1993, Phenix Horns saxophonist Don Myrick was fatally shot
   by the [263]Los Angeles Police Department in a case of mistaken
   identity and on October 13th 1993 former Earth, Wind & Fire member
   (1970-1972) [264]Wade Flemons died from cancer in [265]Battle Creek,
   [266]Michigan.

   In 1994 Earth, Wind and Fire were inducted into the NAACP Hall Of
   Fame.[267][31] On September 15th, 1995, Earth, Wind & Fire was honored
   with a star on [268]Hollywood's [269]Walk of Fame. All the original
   members of the group showed up. Maurice White attributed EWF's success
   to the support of their fans. During this time, Maurice White retired
   from touring with the band for health reasons where he pursued more
   production responsibilities concentrated on producing and developing
   new Earth, Wind & Fire recordings. Phillip Bailey was then given the
   mantle of onstage leader of the band. In The Name of Love was released
   in 1997 on Pyramid Records. Earth, Wind & Fire performed at the 1997
   [270]Montreux Jazz Festival and gave an encore performance the
   following year[271]link.In 1999 Earth, Wind & Fire performed on the
   [272]A&E Network show Live By Request [273]link.

   Earth, Wind & Fire was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on

   band's original members Maurice White, Phillip Bailey, Verdine White,
   Ralph Johnson, Al McKay, Larry Dunn, Andrew Woofolk,Fred White and
   Johnny Graham played together for the first time in 20 years at the
   induction performing Shining Star and That's The Way Of The
   World.[275][32] After their induction into the Hall of Fame an effort
   was made by the original band members to have a full reunion but it
   didn't work out.[276][33]On June 20, 2000 Earth, Wind & Fire were the
   special musical guests at a [277]White House [278]state dinner held in
   a tent on the White House lawn, in honor of His Majesty Mohammed VI,
   King of Morocco.[279][34]
