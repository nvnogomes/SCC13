   Power metal is a style of [32]heavy metal music combining
   characteristics of [33]traditional metal with [34]thrash metal or
   [35]speed metal, often within symphonic context. The term refers to two
   different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced
   in [36]North America with a harder sound similar to [37]speed metal,
   and a later more widespread and popular style based in [38]Europe
   (especially [39]Germany, [40]Italy, [41]Scandinavia) and [42]Japan
   (early [43]Visual Kei bands) with a lighter, more melodic sound and
   frequent use of [44]keyboards.

   Power metal is today associated with an epic sound tempered by
   characteristics of [61]speed metal, power metal's musical forerunner.
   Power metal's lyrical themes, though as varied as metal itself,
   typically focus on [62]fantasy and [63]mythology (eg. , [64]Rhapsody of
   Fire, [65]Blind Guardian, [66]Falconer (band) , [67]Domine),
   camaraderie and hope (eg. [68]DragonForce, [69]Stratovarius,
   [70]Helloween, [71]Gamma Ray, [72]Hammerfall, [73]Lost Horizon,
   [74]Highland Glory, [75]Sabaton), personal struggles and emotions (eg.
   [76]X Japan, [77]Primal Fear, [78]Sonata Arctica, [79]Evergrey) war and
   death (eg. [80]Manowar, [81]Sabaton, [82]Iced Earth) or combinations of
   the listed themes. The prevalence of these lyrical themes span across
   the many languages power metal is performed in (eg. [83]Angra
   (Portuguese), [84]DarkSun (Spanish)). Many typical metal themes such as
   anti-[85]religion and [86]politics are comparatively rare but not
   unheard of.

   Power metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with "clean" vocals
   being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated
   with [90]death metal and [91]black metal. Following in the tradition of
   [92]Ronnie James Dio, [93]Bruce Dickinson, [94]Rob Halford and other
   [95]heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high
   register. The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the [96]tenor
   range, capable of hitting very high notes, like Timo Kotipelto of
   [97]Stratovarius, Michael Kiske of [98]Helloween or Ralf Scheepers of
   [99]Primal Fear. There are however many exceptions such as
   [100]Pyramaze / Iced Earth frontman [101]Matt Barlow, [102]Falconer
   frontman [103]Mathias Blad, and Sabaton frontman Joakim Broden; they
   sing in either [104]baritone or [105]bass range, though in certain
   songs like Creator Failure, Barlow hits very high notes reminiscent of
   Rob Halford. Power metal vocalists [106]Timo Kotipelto of
   [107]Stratovarius, [108]Andi Deris of [109]Helloween, [110]Kai Hansen
   of [111]Gamma Ray, [112]Hansi Krsch of Blind Guardian, Jens Carlsson of
   [113]Persuader / [114]Savage Circus and Matt Smith of [115]Theocracy
   and record multi-layered vocals reminiscent of [116]Queen, creating a
   choral effect.^[117][1]^[118][2] Few power metal vocalists double as
   instrumentalists, but the setup is not unheard of. Some singers within
   other heavy metal genres have high registered voices as do those
   singers of power metal bands. For example [119]Joey Belladonna,
   formerly of American [120]thrash metal band [121]Anthrax, had a voice
   that was often high-pitched. As a result, high registered singing is
   not restricted to power metal bands even though the style is typical
   within the genre.

   Power metal [122]guitarists and [123]bassists generally play rapid
   streams of notes, but change [124]chords comparatively slowly, with a
   [125]harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower. Fast and demanding
   guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed. The slow changing of
   chords are significant in defining power metal just as the fast rapid
   chord changes often define traditional [126]thrash metal. Power metal
   often makes use of Major chord progressions as well as circle
   progressions. Some of the most influential and imitated power metal
   guitarists are [127]Kai Hansen of [128]Gamma Ray, [129]Michael Weikath
   of [130]Helloween and [131]Timo Tolkki of [132]Stratovarius.

   A number of power metal [133]drummers generally play with two [134]bass
   drums for added speed, utilizing them to play a constant stream of
   [135]sixteenth notes (semiquavers) with snare drum accents on the beat.
   This style is fairly common in power metal as in other [136]heavy metal
   subgenres, though it is by no means universal. Power metal though has
   become the most prevalent in the use of this technique. The style was
   perfected by drummer [137]Ingo Schwichtenberg of [138]Helloween along
   with [139]Yoshiki of [140]X Japan, setting a blueprint for many other
   drummers to follow. Some drummers however do not use this technique and
   use a more [141]thrash metal style of drumming with rapid bursts of
   double bass that involve three to six beats with the double kick. Iced
   Earth and Blind Guardian both have had drummers who have used this
   style of drumming as opposed to the more common style. Even more
   uncommon is the use of the [142]blast beat in the genre. The American
   band [143]Cellador and British band Dragonforce are two good examples
   of power metal bands that utilize blast beats in many of their songs.

   Power metal bands often incorporate keyboards into their musical
   arrangements, something popularized by [144]Jens Johansson of
   Stratovarius, though their usage varies from subtle accents to a
   full-blown melody line. Some symphonic power metal bands such as
   [145]Rhapsody of Fire, [146]Fairyland and [147]Nightwish have also been
   known to record with more symphonic elements, and as such, they utilize
   a full orchestra to fill the role a keyboard plays in other power metal
   bands.

   This style is very popular in [148]Europe, [149]Japan, and some
   countries of [150]South America (including [151]Brazil, [152]Venezuela,
   [153]Chile, [154]Peru, [155]Argentina and [156]Colombia), the province
   of [157]Quebec, [158]Canada, where it has a very strong fan base and in
   [159]North America where its popularity is slowly
   rising.^[[160]citation needed]

[[167]edit] American power metal

   "[168]American power metal" emerged in 1980s United States as an
   offshoot of [169]classic metal, [170]thrash metal and [171]speed metal.
   It is usually fast, straightforward and somewhat heavy and aggressive,
   with a distinct epic 'fighting' feel. Keyboards never take a major role
   in this style, with the focus on vocals and riffs. The music is very
   similar to its influences but coined the term 'power metal' and was
   vital in inspiring the later melodic power metal movement.

   Examples: [172]Manowar, [173]Jag Panzer, [174]Crimson Glory

[[175]edit] European/melodic power metal

   [176]Blind Guardian, one of the key acts in European Power metal

   Originating from [177]New Wave Of British Heavy Metal, "Melodic power
   metal" emerged in 1980s [178]Europe with [179]Germany's [180]Helloween
   and [181]Finland's [182]Stratovarius in the 1990s, with a strong focus
   on melody and uplifting, positive themes. [183]Helloween mixed fast
   [184]palm muted [185]speed metal riffs with high pitched clean vocals
   and guitar. The album [186]Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1 was an album
   that made a staple for the birth of power metal. [187]Stratovarius
   further developed this melodic direction by making heavy use of
   [188]keyboards and neo-classical guitar solo duels which are now
   prevalent in almost all power metal. This genre branched and spread
   over Europe and into most of power metal's subgenres, incorporating
   further influences from classical and folk music and reinforcing the
   [189]high fantasy imagery as well as sometimes developing a more
   emotional, romantic edge. The style has become one of the largest metal
   subgenres and its popularity is far from waning. The United States also
   has its share of European style power metal bands, an example of which
   is [190]Kamelot. It should be noted that some power metal bands put
   less emphasis on speed.

   Examples: [191]Stratovarius, [192]Blind Guardian, [193]HammerFall
