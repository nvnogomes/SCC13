[[15]edit] Official games

   Title Description Platform, Developer, Year Released
   [16]Hatris A variety of hats must be made to fall in to stacks of five
   identical hats. Designed by [17]Alexey Pazhitnov, the original Tetris
   author. [18]TurboGrafx-16/PC-Engine (Video System Co. Ltd., 1990),
   [19]Game Boy, [20]Arcade and [21]NES (Bullet Proof Software, 1991)
   [22]Welltris Pieces (including [23]tetrominoes and occasionally
   [24]pentominoes) slide down one of four wall surfaces in a well, the
   "well" being an 8x8 square. When a piece lands while fully or partially
   sticking outside of the well, the wall is temporarily blocked. The game
   ends when four walls are no longer accessible. Another [25]Alexey
   Pazhitnov design. [26]PC (Spectrum Holobyte, 1991), [27]ZX Spectrum,
   [28]CPC, [29]C64, [30]Amiga, [31]Mac OS Classic
   Super Tetris^[32][1] Added two-player co-operative and competitive and
   new block types. [33]MS-DOS, [34]Amiga (Sphere, Inc., 1991)
   Super Tetris 2 & Bombliss^[35][2] Differs from conventional Tetris in
   that one mode, "Bombliss", features bomb blocks that destroy
   surrounding blocks when a line is completed. Bombliss uses the gravity
   algorithm to re-arrange the stage after an explosion has destroyed some
   blocks. Also, there is a "Tetris C" mode in which the playfield
   automatically rises one level after a certain number of blocks are
   used.

   A Super Tetris 2 & Bombliss Limited version was released in 1994. A
   network version entitled All Japan Super Bombliss Cup'95 was broadcast
   in 1995. The Bombliss mode was remade into Tetris Blast in 1996.
   Super Famicom (Blue Planet Software, 1992), [36]Satellaview (1995)
   Tetris 2^[37][3] Uses disconnected colored tetrominoes instead of
   adjacent type tetrominoes. It is the first Tetris to make use of the
   gravity algorithm. Blocks of the same color stick together. The goal of
   Tetris 2 is to clear the bottom rows, which a similar type of play can
   be found in the later released The Next Tetris or Tetris II. Released
   as Tetris Flash in Japan. [38]NES, [39]Famicom Disk System and [40]Game
   Boy (Nintendo, 1993), [41]SNES (Nintendo, 1994)
   Tetris Battle Gaiden^[[42]citation needed] Similar to [43]Puyo Puyo in
   use of competitive mode, characters, and humorous storyline. Different
   characters can also unleash special moves that affect the opponent in
   some way (knock away the current piece, rearrange matrix,
   photocopy/fax, earthquake, orbital laser, mirror shield etc). Also
   includes a Rensa mode, in which gravity takes a bigger part. Came to
   the attention of European gamers by way of a review in Issue 18 (April
   1994) of [44]Super Play magazine. Super Famicom (Blue Planet Software,
   1993)
   [45]Tetris & Dr. Mario Compilation of Tetris and Dr. Mario with
   enhanced graphics and sound. Super Nintendo (Nintendo, 1994)
   Super Tetris 3 & Sparkliss, Magicaliss, Familiss^[46][4] Sparkliss uses
   the same concept as Bombliss (see above) but the bomb's explosions
   spread only as horizontal and vertical lines instead of being
   rectangular in shape. This makes for more complicated stages and
   puzzles where some blocks need to be hit more than once by explosions
   before they are destroyed.

   Magicaliss follows the same gameplay as Tetris. The differences lie in
   that all pieces can be of only 4 colors. Making a full line in one
   unique color destroys all the blocks of that color in the stage. The
   remaining blocks fall in place using the gravity algorithm.

   Familiss is a traditional Tetris where 4 players play simultaneously.
   Beneath the stage of each player is a panel that changes randomly.
   Lines destroyed by a player will be sent to whatever his/her bottom
   panel shows. For example "+1" sends the lines destroyed to player one;
   "-3" will clear for player 3 as many lines as were destroyed; "+ALL"
   and "-ALL" affect all players.
   Super Famicom (Blue Planet Software, 1994)
   Tetris Blast The same as the Bombliss mode in Super Tetris 2 &
   Bombliss. In an added "Fight" mode, there are creatures that traverse
   the constantly changing 'terrain' of the play field and try to hinder
   the player from clearing the screen of blocks. Game Boy (Nintendo /
   Bulletproof, 1996)^[47][5]
   [48]Tetris Attack A version of the Japanese game [49]Panel de Pon with
   redone art made to resemble [50]Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island.
   Has no relation to Tetris other than name and genre. Also spawned
   [51]Pokmon Puzzle League for the [52]N64, [53]Pokmon Puzzle Challenge
   for the [54]Game Boy Color, [55]Puzzle League for the [56]Game Boy
   Advance, and [57]Planet Puzzle League for the [58]Nintendo DS. [59]SNES
   and [60]Game Boy (Nintendo/Intelligent Systems, 1996)
   [61]3D Tetris [62]Virtual Boy (Nintendo, 1996)
   [63]Tetris Plus Added to the classic Tetris is the new Puzzle Mode.
   Each level begins with a character (the professor) standing on a
   different pattern of blocks. This is somewhat is similar to Welltris
   The goal is to clear the blocks out from under him to get him to the
   bottom. He climbs to the top of the blocks you're stacking up and the
   game ends when the professor and the descending spiked ceiling collide.
   Arcade (Jaleco Ltd., 1995), PlayStation (Jaleco Ltd., 1996), Saturn
   (Jaleco Ltd., 1996), Game Boy (Nintendo, 1997)
   [64]Tetris plus 2 This version is an improved version of Tetris Plus.
   Arcade (Jaleco Ltd., 1997)
   [65]Tetrisphere Uses some of the tetrominoes (as well as two 3-block
   piece) with different gameplay than standard Tetris. The object of the
   game is to reveal the core in the center of the sphere (which is
   actually a [66]torus as seen through a [67]fisheye perspective). To
   achieve this, you need to stack similarly-shaped pieces on top of each
   other. Once three are stacked, the pieces disappear and reveal the
   layer below. If the player doesn't clear blocks fast enough they lose
   one life, and if they lose three, the game is over. Wild card pieces,
   power-ups and a limited ability to slide pieces over the surface of the
   sphere all help with this task. Nintendo 64 (H2O Entertainment
   Corporation, 1997)
   [68]Tetris DX The Game Boy version of Tetris updated for the Game Boy
   Color Game Boy Color (Nintendo, 1998)
   Tetris 4D^[69][6] Dreamcast (Blue Planet Software, 1998)
   [70]Tetris 64 Includes Normal Tetris, Giga Tetris that has tetriminoes
   of different sizes, and Bio Tetris that adjusts itself based on
   feedback from a heartbeat measuring clip that attaches to the user's
   ear. Nintendo 64 (Amtex Software, 1998)
   [71]Tetris: The Grand Master Released in Japan, designed for seasoned
   and skilled Tetris players. At higher levels, tetriminoes begin to drop
   so fast that they appear immediately at the bottom, with no airborne
   phase at all; Players only have a split-second to slide the block into
   designated locations before they lock down. This distinctive style is
   called "20G". Subsequent entries in the Grand Master series continued
   the high-speed trend. Arcade (Arika/Capcom, 1998)
   Kids Tetris^[72][7] Tetrominoes start out with two blocks and increase
   with further lines. Circus, Firehouse, Haunted House and Laboratory
   stages have different graphical effects with each cleared level.
   Includes printing option. PC (Blue Planet Software/Hasbro, 1999)
   [73]The New Tetris Tetris with a new feature: when a 16-block (4 by 4)
   square is made, the tetrominos used to form the square are merged as
   16-block squares. A square formed using different types of tetrominos
   is called a combo square or multisquare, and it appears silver. A
   square formed using four of the same piece is called a pure square or
   monosquare, and it appears gold. All pieces but the S and Z can form
   monosquares. Nintendo 64 (H2O Entertainment Corporation, 1999)
   The Next Tetris The Next Tetris was a version of the game with an
   emphasis on the cascade mode. Playstation (Hasbro, 1999), PC (Hasbro,
   1999), Dreamcast (Crave, 2000), Nuon (Toshiba, 2001),
   [74]Magical Tetris Challenge Choose Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy
   and Minnie Mouse in Story mode. The game implements a new Tetris
   deviation of combos, where consecutive cleared lines give those clears
   greater value. Non-story variations include magical, updown, and
   endless mode with other mdes which can be unlocked in the story mode.
   Nintendo 64 (Capcom, 1999), Game Boy Color (Capcom, 2000), PlayStation
