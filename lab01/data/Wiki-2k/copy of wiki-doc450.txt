   Dubai Internet City (DIC; [15]Arabic: ) is an information
   [16]technology park created by the Government of [17]Dubai as a
   [18]free economic zone and a strategic base for companies targeting
   regional emerging markets. The economic rules of DIC allow companies to
   avail themselves of a number of ownership, taxation and custom related
   benefits which are guaranteed by law for a period of 50
   years^[[19]citation needed]. One model of operation includes 100%
   [20]foreign ownership, similar to those prevailing in other designated
   economic zones in the [21]United Arab Emirates^[[22]citation needed].
   These freedoms have led many global [23]information technology firms,
   such as [24]Microsoft, [25]IBM, [26]Oracle Corporation, [27]Sun
   Microsystems, [28]Cisco, [29]HP, [30]Nokia and [31]Siemens, [32]Nera
   Telecom, as well as UAE based companies such as [33]i-mate, [34]Acette,
   to move their regional base to the DIC. DIC is located adjacent to
   other industrial clusters such as [35]Dubai Media City and [36]Dubai
   Knowledge Village.

   DIC presently has over one and half million square feet of prime
   commercial office space, in which over 850 companies with over 10,000
   workers are based^[[37]citation needed]. In March 2008, DIC announced a
   rent hike of 25% for leases signed after June 2008. The government
   imposes a rent cap of 5% on private landlords, but exempts its own
   projects from the law. It is claimed that the rent is still below the
   market rate, but this is in a city that proudly boasts that it will
   soon have the most expensive office rents in the world^[[38]citation
   needed].

[[46]edit] Connectivity

   On 13 April 2008, [47]du (EITC) announced that all of its traffic would
   be routed via the UAE's censorship proxy which blocks access to any
   content deemed 'inappropriate'. du had been previously blocking VOIP
   services.^[48][1]

   While Dubai Internet City sells itself as a business-friendly
   environment with excellent connectivity, the reality is one of a
   heavily censored internet known to block content believed to be in
   disagreement with moral, social and cultural ideals of the UAE. In
   addition to webpage censorship, it is speculated that a variety of
   popular social networking services are blocked.

   The UAE proxy can be bypassed by various methods including by setting
   up a [49]VPN to connect securely to a server in another country to
   reduce the amount of [50]Internet censorship, with the advantage that
   UAE authorities cannot 'snoop' on the traffic.^[[51]citation needed]
   While the UAE may block access to the web sites companies providing VPN
   services, it is possible^[[52]citation needed] to arrange overseas
   accounts. Such options may^[[53]weasel words] be a necessity for many
   companies in the free zones to stay in business.

   Around 11.15 AM on January 30, 2008, a ship's anchor apparently severed
   fibre optic cables between Palermo, Italy, and Alexandria, Egypt.
   Providers across the Middle East and as far as India and Pakistan were
   heavily affected with a significant slowdown of communications
   reported. The UAE telecommunications company and Dubai Internet City's
   internet service provider [54]du was one of the worst hit, having been
   completely inoperational for several hours. Since du has a monopoly in
   the Free Zones, customers had no alternative connectivity during the
   outage^[[55]citation needed].

[[56]edit] History

   Dubai Internet City, a member of Dubai Holding subsidiary TECOM
   Investments, opened its doors in October 2000.

   Dubai Internet City (DIC) provides a knowledge economy ecosystem
   designed to facilitate the business development of Internet and
   Communications Technology (ICT) companies. It is the Middle East's
   biggest ICT infrastructure, built inside a free trade zone.

   DIC is a strategic base for companies targeting emerging markets in a
   vast region extending from the Middle East to the Indian subcontinent,
   and from Africa to the CIS countries, covering 2 billion people with a
   GDP of $6.7 trillion. Within a short span of time, a dynamic
   international community of ICT companies has established itself in
   Dubai Internet City.

   The global ICT giants like [57]Microsoft, [58]Oracle Corporation,
   [59]HP, [60]IBM, [61]Dell, [62]Siemens, [63]Canon, [64]Logica, [65]Sony
   Ericsson, [66]Schlumberger^[[67]citation needed] and [68]Cisco, as well
   as many small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurial ventures are
   based in DIC. The ICT cluster in Dubai Internet City comprises
   companies from sectors like software development, business services,
   e-commerce, consultancy and sales and marketing.

   The cluster environment of DIC provides most elements of the value
   chain for an ICT business. In addition, it has developed programmes
   that can be leveraged by the ICT community to explore and expand
   channel and business development opportunities.

[[69]edit] Economics

   Dubai Internet City, like the whole of Dubai, has seen rapid growth,
   with the Emirate's GDP rising at double digit rates. However, since
   2003 inflation has climbed rapidly too, making real GDP growth
   significantly lower. The latest official government figures (2006)
   state inflation of 9.6%. By spring 2008, the level is somewhere over
   10%, and approaching 20% according to the estimates of some
   international banks.^[[70]citation needed]

   The government has implemented price controls on rent rises as well as
   fuel and basic commodities such as rice, but these cannot be viewed as
   effective long term anti-inflation measures in a market economy. The
   UAE has continued to reiterate the commitment to pegging its currency
   to a continually weakening dollar, which rules out significant interest
   rate rises - the accepted inflation-fighting tool in developed
   countries. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts of 1.25% in January 2008
   have been mirrored by the UAE Central Bank, which is certain to fuel
   inflation further and weaken the currency.

   In March 2008, DIC announced a rental increase to 180 [71]AED per
   square foot - a 25% rise (the government's rent cap on private
   landlords is 5% for 2008). The DIC statement accompanying the release
   said "operating costs have shot up recently due to economic growth in
   the region". It made no mention of the decision by the UAE government
   in November 2007 to hike federal government employees salaries by a
   whopping 70%. With the increase, the rent at DIC is still a little
   below the prevailing market rate, although this is in a city that it is
   claimed will soon dislodge London as having the most expensive office
   rents in the world.

   With the government continuing to resist de-pegging the currency from
   the US [72]Dollar while excluding itself from the rent cap laws in
   order to fund the (largely Emirati) government workers' large salary
   increases, there seems now to be no prospect that the UAE will address
   inflation and restore the long-term competitiveness of its economy.
   With only 1 year leases available, investors must take a significant
   leap of faith that their business plans adequately factor in the
   relentlessly spiralling costs as well as the reduced incomes with the
   weakening Dollar-pegged Dirham.

[[73]edit] Location

   Dubai Internet City is about 25 kilometers south of downtown Dubai
   city, on Sheikh Zayed Road between [74]Dubai and [75]Abu Dhabi. It is
   located adjacent to [76]Dubai Marina, [77]Jumeirah Beach Residence and
   the well-known [78]Palm Jumeirah, areas which are rapidly becoming
   three of the most exclusive (and expensive) residential areas of Dubai.
   DIC is less than 1 km from the sea coast and is near several five star
   hotels.
