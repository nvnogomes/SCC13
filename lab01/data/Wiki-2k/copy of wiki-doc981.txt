[[31]edit] Scroll Inscriptions

   The fixed suspender bar was decorated with an inscribed scroll the
   inscription of which had a number of variations.
     * TERRITORIAL: This was the inscription for those serving in the
       [32]Territorial Army of [33]UK. It lasted from 1930 to 2000, with a
       [34]hiatus of approximately 12 years when the T&AVR inscription was
       used (see below). During this period there were 4 Obverse types for
       the main body of the medal being the two effigies of [35]George VI
       and the two of [36]Elizabeth II).

     * MILITIA: This was granted to members of the [37]Supplementary
       Reserve until the formation of the [38]Army Emergency Reserve in
       1951 which had its own medal. It lasted from 1930 to 1951. During
       this period there were 3 Obverse types for the main body of the
       medal being the one effigy of [39]George V and the two effigies of
       [40]George VI.

   [41]T&AVR scroll bar

   *T&AVR: This was introduced when the [42]Territorial and Army Volunteer
   Reserve was created and lasted from 1969 to 1982 after which the
   TERRITORIAL inscription was resumed. During this period there was one
   Obverse type for the main body of the medal being the second effigy
   type of [43]Elizabeth II.
   [44]India scroll bar

   *(NAME OF COMMONWEALTH COUNTRY): For medals awarded to a member of a
   force outside of the [45]United Kingdom the scroll had the name of the
   country of that force inscribed upon it. During this period all 5
   Obverse types were used across the various medals for the main body of
   the medal, although not all countries had all five types.

[[118]edit] Ribbon Variations

     * [119]Honourable Artillery Company: For members of the
       [120]Honourable Artillery Company the ribbon differed, being a half
       blue, half scarlet ribbon, with yellow edges. This distinction was
       bestowed by King [121]Edward VII for the [122]Volunteer Long
       Service And Good Conduct Medal and the honour extended to the same
       medals under the Territorial designations. The HAC ribbon colours
       were the household colours of King [123]Edward VII. ^[124][2]

[[125]edit] Note regarding South Africa

   The [126]Efficiency Decoration (South Africa) is a very similar medal
   but is not included in the above Commonwealth Country types because it
   is a separate medal. The scroll inscription read UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA,
   but the inscription also had the [127]Afrikaans equivalent below as
   well as the reverse of the medal bearing a [128]bilingual
   inscription.^[129][3]
