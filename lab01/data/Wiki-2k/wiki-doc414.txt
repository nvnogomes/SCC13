   Droopy
   A standard Droopy opening title card from the early 1950s.
   Directed by [9]Tex Avery
   [10]Dick Lundy
   [11]Michael Lah
   Produced by [12]Fred Quimby
   [13]William Hanna and [14]Joseph Barbera
   Release date(s) [15]1943 - [16]1958
   Country [17]U.S.A.
   Language [18]English

   Droopy is an [19]animated [20]cartoon character, an [21]anthropomorphic
   [22]dog (supposedly a [23]basset hound) with a droopy face, hence the
   name Droopy. He was created by [24]Tex Avery, for theatrical cartoon
   shorts produced by the [25]Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, in 1943.
   Essentially the polar opposite of Avery's other famous MGM character,
   the loud and wacky [26]Screwy Squirrel, Droopy moved slowly and
   lethargically, spoke in a jowly monotone, and, though he didn't look
   like much, was shrewd enough to outwit his enemies.

   The character first appeared, nameless, in Avery's 1943 cartoon
   Dumb-hounded. Though he would not be called "Droopy" onscreen until his
   fifth cartoon, Seor Droopy (1949), the character was officially first
   labeled Happy Hound, a name used in the character's appearances in
   [27]Our Gang Comics. After the demise of the Droopy series in 1958, the
   character has been revived several times for new productions, often
   [28]television shows also featuring MGM's other famous cartoon stars,
   [29]Tom and Jerry.

[[39]edit] History

[[40]edit] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer

   Droopy first appeared in the [41]MGM [42]cartoon [43]Dumb-Hounded,
   released by MGM on [44]March 20, [45]1943 which is considered one of
   Avery's best works by animation scholars^[[46]citation needed].
   Droopy's first scene is when he saunters into view, looks at the
   audience, and declares, "Hello all you happy people...you know what?
   I'm the hero." In the cartoon, Droopy is tracking an escaped convict
   and is always waiting for the crook wherever he turns up. Avery had
   used a similar gag in his 1941 [47]Merrie Melodies short [48]Tortoise
   Beats Hare [49]short, which in turn was an expansion/exaggeration of
   the premise of his [50]The Blow Out (1936). In fact, this cartoon shows
   that early ideas about Droopy's personality were already germinating,
   as that film's [51]Cecil Turtle is very similar in character to Droopy.

   Droopy's [52]meek, [53]deadpan [54]voice and personality were modeled
   after the character Wallace Wimple on the [55]radio comedy [56]Fibber
   McGee and Molly; actor [57]Bill Thompson, who played Wimple, was the
   original voice of Droopy. During his time in the [58]US Navy during
   [59]World War II, the role was played by other [60]voice actors,
   including [61]Don Messick, who reprised the role in the 1990s. Avery's
   preferred gag man [62]Heck Allen said that Tex himself provided the
   voice on several occasions, and "You couldn't tell the
   difference."^[63][1] Droopy himself was a versatile actor: he could
   play a [64]Mountie, a [65]cowboy, a [66]deputy, an [67]heir, or a
   [68]Dixieland-loving everyday Joe with equal ease. The same voice was
   used for Big Heel-Watha in the [69]Screwy Squirrel cartoon of the same
   name.

   One of Droopy's traits is his incredible strength, given his dimunitive
   stature and unassuming looks and personality, but only when he was
   upset, and then he would monotone, "You know what? That makes me mad,"
   prior to tossing the hapless villain of the piece over his head many
   times. One such occasion was in [70]Seor Droopy, where he did this to a
   bull. It happened again in [71]One Droopy Knight, where a dragon was
   Droopy's victim. This was also once done by a baby version of Droopy,
   in the Western-themed short, [72]Homesteader Droopy.

   In most of his cartoons, Droopy matches wits with either a slick
   anthropomorphic Wolf (the Wolf character "portrays" the crooks in both
   Dumb-hounded and its semi-remake, [73]Northwest Hounded Police (1946))
   or a bulldog named "Spike", sometimes silent, sometimes sporting a
   [74]Gaelic accent. Two Droopy cartoons - [75]The Shooting of Dan McGoo
   and [76]Wild and Woolfy - also feature appearances from the curvy
   heroine of Avery's [77]Red Hot Riding Hood (1943) as a damsel in
   distress being pursued by the Wolf. Three later Droopy cartoons -
   [78]Three Little Pups (1953), [79]Blackboard Jumble (1957), and
   [80]Sheep Wrecked (1958) - feature a slow-moving southern wolf
   character. Voiced by [81]Daws Butler in a dialect he later used for
   [82]Hanna-Barbera's [83]Huckleberry Hound, this wolf was a more deadpan
   character with a tendency to whistle "[84]Kingdom Coming" (aka
   "Jubalio") to himself (much like Huckleberry would sing "[85]Oh My
   Darling Clementine" to himself).

   Avery took a year-long break from MGM from 1950 to 1951, during which
   time [86]Dick Lundy took over his unit to do one Droopy cartoon,
   [87]Caballero Droopy, and several [88]Barney Bear cartoons. Avery
   returned in late 1951 and continued with Droopy and his one-shots until
   the Avery unit was dissolved by MGM in 1953. Michael Lah, an Avery
   animator, stayed on long enough to help [89]William Hanna and
   [90]Joseph Barbera complete [91]Deputy Droopy after Avery had left the
   studio. Lah himself then left MGM, but returned in 1955 to direct
   [92]CinemaScope Droopy cartoons costarring either Spike, now called
   Butch because of the same-named bulldog in Hanna and Barbera's [93]Tom
   and Jerry cartoons, or the "Kingdom Coming"-whistling wolf. One of
   these, One Droopy Knight (1957), was nominated for the 1957 [94]Academy
   Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons). However, by the time of One
   Droopy Knight's release in December 1957, the MGM cartoon studio had
   been closed for six months, a casualty of corporate downsizing.

[[95]edit] Later appearances

   In 1980, [96]Filmation produced a series of lower-budget Droopy shorts
   for television as part of a new Tom and Jerry show, with [97]Frank
   Welker and producer [98]Lou Scheimer alternating as the voice of the
   hound.

   In the 1990s, [99]Hanna-Barbera offering [100]Tom & Jerry Kids, Droopy
   had a young son named Dripplepossibly an older version of the infant we
   see in Homesteader Droopy. The mild success of the show provided
   perhaps the most Droopy merchandise: plush toys, gummy snacks,
   figurines, etc. Tom & Jerry Kids had a spin-off series, [101]Droopy,
   Master Detective. He also had cameos in two theatrical features: as an
   elevator operator in [102]Who Framed Roger Rabbit (where he was voiced
   by the film's [103]animation director [104]Richard Williams), and in
   [105]Tom and Jerry: The Movie (voiced by Messick). Droopy also had
   cameos in all three subsequently-produced [106]Roger Rabbit shorts,
   [107]Tummy Trouble, [108]Roller Coaster Rabbit, and [109]Trail Mix-Up
   (played by Williams in the first short and by [110]Corey Burton in the
   latter two). Droopy also appears in the 2006 cartoon series [111]Tom
   and Jerry Tales, voiced by [112]Don Brown. He even makes an appearance
   in the direct-to-video special [113]Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring,
   voiced by [114]Jeff Bennett.

   A three-issue Droopy comic book miniseries was released in the
   mid-1990s by [115]Dark Horse Comics.

   [116]Matt Groening has stated that he based [117]The Simpsons-character
   [118]Hans Moleman on Droopy.

   [119]Jon Stewart, host of [120]Comedy Central's news parody [121]The
   Daily Show, has taken to imitating [122]Connecticut senator and 2000
   Democratic vice-presidential candidate [123]Joe Lieberman with Droopy
   Dog's voice and mannerisms.

   In the early 2000s, Droopy appeared in a [124]Cartoon Network short
   entitled Thanks a Latt, in which he works at a coffee shop and tricks a
   greedy wolf into giving him a tip. The short now airs on Cartoon
   Network's sister channel [125]Boomerang.

   During the same period, Droopy was also featured in [126]Adult Swim's
   [127]Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law in the episode "Droopy Botox"
   voiced by [128]Maurice LaMarche. He is seen seeking a settlement after
   a cosmetic surgeon injected him with too much [129]botox (A
   [130]running gag in this episode was the fact that Droopy was often
   seen crying despite having a huge grin frozen on his face, whereas in
   the classic cartoons a sad-faced Droopy would often say, "You know
   what? I'm happy").

   In a 2004 episode of the [131]Comedy Central animated series [132]Drawn
   Together, "[133]Clara's Dirty Little Secret", the character [134]Foxxy
   Love listens to a book on tape entitled: Clara's Story: How I Kissed a
   Black Girl, as read by Droopy Dog on headphones. The character
   [135]Toot Braunstein listens for a moment as well, hearing the voice of
   Droopy reading a sentence that begins, "As her buttery maple pelvis
   gyrated..."

   In the [136]Family Guy episode "[137]Ocean's Three and a Half," a
   parody of [138]Fox News Channel's former show [139]Hannity & Colmes
   featured co-host [140]Alan Colmes portrayed by Droopy Dog.
