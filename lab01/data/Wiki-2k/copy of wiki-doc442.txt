   DuBois (pronounced [31]/dubz/ doo-BOYS or [32]/dubz/ DOO-boys, not
   /dubw/ doo-BWAH) is a [33]city in [34]Clearfield County,
   [35]Pennsylvania, 91 miles (146 km) northeast of [36]Pittsburgh.
   Settled in 1812, laid out in 1872, DuBois was incorporated as a borough
   in 1881 and as a city in 1914. While DuBois was founded as a lumber
   town, the mining of [37]bituminous coal quickly became the chief
   industry in DuBois, supporting a population of 9,375 in 1900; 12,623 in
   1910; 13,681 in 1920; and 12,080 in 1940. The population was 8,123 at
   the 2000 census.

   The town was founded by John Rumbarger, for whom the town was
   originally named. The town was later renamed for local lumber magnate
   John DuBois, who came from a longstanding American family of French
   [38]Huguenot descent.

[[70]edit] Culture and the Arts

   The DuBois tri-county area is building a strong reputation in local
   entertainment and the arts. DuBois is the hometown of Educational
   Entertainment Specialist Gene Allen, known for his character education
   programs for schools and libraries. More traditional arts can be found
   at the Winkler Gallery as well as the annual arts festival. The theatre
   group "Cultural Resources Inc." also performs a selection of theatre
   productions each year at the Paul G. Reitz Theatre in downtown DuBois.

[[71]edit] The Brewery

   There seems to be some debate as to exactly when Frank Hahne came to
   DuBois and broke ground on his own facility. One source claims 1898,
   another 1897. It seems most likely that this occurred between April and
   the end of 1896. It was on April 16, 1896, that the DuBois Weekly
   Courier reported: "Some new developments in connection with the brewery
   may be looked for in the near future."

   There were a number of reasons Hahne chose the DuBois site for his
   facility, but the most frequently cited was the excellence of the water
   supply. He purchased 2,300 acres (9.3 km^2) surrounding the local
   reservoir to protect the watershed from pollution.

   By 1906, the brewery had four products on the market: DuBois
   Wurzburger, Hahne's Export Pilsener, DuBois Porter and DuBois
   Budweiser. The Budweiser name would be at the center of controversy for
   60 years between DuBois Brewing and Anheuser-Busch.

   The DuBois brands soon traveled far and wide for a brewery of its size;
   ranging up to 150 miles (240 km) away and selling well in Buffalo, Erie
   and Pittsburgh. The brewery's 300 barrel kettle was kept busy churning
   out brands, while the left-over grain materials were pressed and sold
   for cattle feed and grist mills in the rural areas surrounding DuBois.

   As with many other American breweries, DuBois Brewing moved right along
   until 1918 and the advent of Prohibition. The brewery shifted
   production to "near beer", soft drinks and opened H&G Ice Company.
   According to the April 7, 1933 DuBois Courier the brewery won the honor
   of being one of only two breweries in the entire nation that had never
   violated or been suspected of violating the Prohibition laws since the
   18th amendment became effective. As a result, DuBois Brewing Company
   was issued license number G-2 allowing them to resume brewing
   immediately on Repeal. Other breweries had to wait varying periods as a
   form of punishment. On the first day of beer production, DuBois
   products sold at between 10 and 15 cents per pint bottle. A glass at
   local taverns was 10 cents.

   Frank Hahne died in 1932 and the brewery was passed to his son Frank
   Jr. Frank Jr. was the only son. He had a son who died in infancy
   denying the family an heir. The tragedy of this was not realized until
   1967. Frank Hahne Jr. sold the brewery to Pittsburgh Brewing in 1967.

   The new owners of the Budweiser name reportedly "settled" with
   Anheuser-Busch to the tune of a $1 million dollar profit for Pittsburgh
   Brewing. Five years later, in May 1972, the brewery was closed forever,
   leaving 100 workers out of a job.

   The Brewery was torn down in late 2008 to make way for business
   development. One group rumored to be interested in the site is Dr.
   Frank Ott and the DuBois Regional Medical Center (DRMC). Dr. Ott
   intends on opening a women's health center on the lot.

[[72]edit] Transportation

   DuBois is served by DuBois Regional Airport (IATA: DUJ). Gulfstream
   Airlines, as a codeshare partner with [73]Continental Airlines,
   operates three to four daily flights to and from [74]Cleveland Hopkins
   International Airport.
