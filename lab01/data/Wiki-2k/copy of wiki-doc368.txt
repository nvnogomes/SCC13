   The battle card games are a hybrid of role playing games, board games,
   and trading cards. The players move around a game board, and encounter
   characters on the way. Some characters offer information and others
   need to be battled. The outcome of each fight is determined by the
   randomly generated hand of cards players and the opponent are dealt.
   The player flips over cards in a certain order, and their actions are
   shown in an animated battle that lasts until one of the characters is
   defeated.

   AI-controlled fight one another. In Tournament, the player can fight to
   earn the title of the ultimate fighter. Up to eight fighters can enter
   a tournament, though cannot fight simultaneously. Practice mode,
   present only in Super Butden 3 and Shin Butden, allows players to
   freely select their fighter and opponent to pracice their fighting
   techniques. Health does not deplete, so the player can practice for as
   long as they desire.

   Shin Butden also features two other exclusive modes: Group Battle and
   [356]Mr. Satan mode. In Group Battle, players gets to create a team of
   five characters and fight against either another player or an
   AI-controlled character. In Mr. Satan mode, Mr. Satan is trying to
   raise enough money to pay off his debt to [357]Artificial Human 18, and
   the player places bets on matches and cheats by using several items,
   such as banana peels, guns, and dynamite.

[[358]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden

   Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden (Z ,Doragon Bru Zetto Ch Butden^[359]?,
   Dragon Ball Z: Super Fighting Story) is the first installment in the
   Super Butden series. The game was released in Japan on March 20, 1993
   and in France and Spain on November 30, 1993. Super Butden features 10
   playable characters and its story mode spans from the [360]final saga
   of [361]Dragon Ball to the conclusion of the [362]Cell Games.

[[363]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden 2

   Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden 2 (Z 2 ,Doragon Bru Zetto Ch Butden
   Tz^[364]?, Dragon Ball Z: Super Fighting Story 2), called Dragon Ball Z
   2: la Lgende Saien in France, is the second installment in the Super
   Butden series. The game was released in Japan on December 17, 1993 and
   in France and Spain in 1994. Super Butden 2 features 10 playable
   characters (8 normal, 2 unlockable with a code) and its story mode
   covers the [365]Cell Games, as well as several stories involving
   [366]Bojack, [367]Zangya, and [368]Broli completely unrelated to the
   movies they hail from. For unknown reasons, these three characters were
   renamed Kujila, Aki, and Tara in the French version, respectively.

   The story mode became very popular at the time because of its many
   different variations. Depending on if the player wins or loses a
   battle, the story will take a different turn, which leads to a lot of
   possibilities to experience. The official French translation was clumsy
   and most of the time hardly comprehensible for anyone unfamiliar with
   the Dragon Ball story. A significant number of sentences were
   grammatically incorrect, sometimes to the point of complete
   incoherence.

   This is the only Dragon Ball Z fighting game in which Goku is not
   readily playable. A code is required to unlock him and Broly, the other
   hidden character.

[[369]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden 3

   Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden (Z 3 ,Doragon Bru Zetto Ch Butden
   Sur^[370]?, Dragon Ball Z: Super Fighting Story 3), called Dragon Ball
   Z 3: Ultime Menace in France, is the third installment in the Super
   Butden series. The game was released in Japan on September 29, 1994 and
   in France and Spain in 1994. Super Butden 3 features ten playable
   characters. Strangely enough, it is the only game in the series that
   lacks a story mode.

   The game has 10 characters, 9 normal and 1 hidden. The hidden
   character, Future Trunks, can be unlocked with a code.

[[371]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Shin Butden

   Dragon Ball Z: Shin Super Butden (Z ,Doragon Bru Zetto Shin
   Butden^[372]?, Dragon Ball Z: True Fighting Story) is the fourth
   installment in the Super Butden series. The game was released only in
   Japan on November 17, 1995. The game features 26 playable characters,
   their sprites being those used in an earlier [373]Dragon Ball Z game,
   [374]Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 22. Its story mode ranges from the
   [375]Android Saga to the [376]Cell Games.

   fight with [385]Piccolo at the [386]23rd World Tournament to his final
   battle with [387]Freeza after the latter had reached the [388]Super
   Saiyan state.

   stage, which allows opponents to hit each other to other stages. The
   playable characters are Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Perfect Cell, Piccolo,
   Vegetto, Freiza, Majin Buu, Kid Buu, and Gotenks.

[[425]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Son Goku Densetsu

   Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Son Goku Densetsu (Z ,Doragon Bru Zetto
   Idainaru Son Gok Densetsu^[426]?, Dragon Ball Z: The Greatest [427]Son
   Goku Legend) was released for the [428]TurboGrafx-16 in Japan on
   November 11, 1994 (1994-11-11). It features Gohan telling Goten of the
   battles of their deceased father, Goku, along with other characters.
   The game illustrates Goku's seven greatest battles: Fighting Tao Pai
   Pai, challenging Tenshinhan at the Tenkaichi Budokai, destroying
   Piccolo Daimao, fighting Piccolo at the Tenkaichi Budokai, protecting
   Earth from Vegeta, saving Namek from Freiza, and sacrificing his life

   for any scenario.

   overwhelming negative reviews, with the general complaint being that
   the game was rushed to get it out in time for the holidays.

[[445]edit] Dragon Ball Z: The Legend

   Dragon Ball Z: The Legend, known as Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Dragon Ball
   Densetsu (Z ,Doragon Bru Zetto Idainaru Doragon Bru Densetsu^[446]?,
   Dragon Ball Z: The Greatest Dragon Ball Legend) in Japan, is a fighting
   game produced and released by [447]Bandai on March 31, 1996 in Japan
   and the same year in Europe for the [448]Sega Saturn and
   [449]PlayStation. Greatest Hits versions were released on June 20, 1997
   for the Saturn and June 27, 1997 for the PlayStation.

   The game utilizes a unique system of play that is different from most
   other fighters. The graphics feature 2-D sprites in a three dimensional
   world. Although each battle begins on the ground, the majority of the
   action is featured skyward. The characters fly around each and utilize
   rapid punches and kicks, and [450]ki blasts, either singularly or
   rapidly by holding the assigned button for a short period. The
   characters have a limited amount of ki that can be charged over time.
   If the player uses all of their available ki their character will stop
   fighting out of exhaustion, leaving them wide open for an attack. The
   life meter is a scale made up of energy from both sides that shifts
   depending on damage taken, and after one side is depleted, the
   character performs a special "Meteo Attack", which takes place in a cut
   scene and finishes of the opponent. Each match is made up of two teams
   that can include one fighter or multiple fighters that can be switched
   out at various times.

[[451]edit] Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 22

   Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 22 (Z 22 ,Doragon Bru Zetto Arutimeito
   Batoru Towintetz^[452]?) is a fighting game released July 28,
   1995 (1995-07-28) in Japan, rereleased as a Greatest Hit game on
   December 6, 1995 (1995-12-06), released in Europe on July
   1996 (1996-07), and released in North America years later on March 25,
   2003 (2003-03-25). The game features cel drawings from the animators as
   character sprites and three dimensional backgrounds. The playable
   characters are Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Cell, Android 16,
   Android 18, Frieza, Zarbon, Recoome, Captain Ginyu, Dabura, Goten, Kid
   Trunks, Supreme Kai, Majin Buu (Good), Super Buu, Super Saiyan Gotenks,
   Great Saiyaman, Krillin, Tien, and Piccolo. Unlockable characters

   Goku.

   negative American reviews. [453]GameSpot give it a 1.2/10, calling it a
   "really, really terrible game." [454]X-Play said it was "a waste of
   time and money." [455]Official PlayStation Magazine gave it a 1/5, the
   second lowest score possible. [456]Electronic Gaming Monthly said that
   "someone crapped in a jewel case and passed it off as a game." Overall,
   it has a 32% on [457]Game Rankings.

[[458]edit] Dragon Power

   Dragon Power, known in Japan as Dragon Ball: Shinryuu no Nazo (
   ,Doragon Bru: Shinryuu no Nazo^[459]?), was developed by [460]TOSE
   Software Company and released by [461]Bandai in 1986. The game stars
   [462]Son Goku and very roughly follows the first two volumes of the
   Dragon Ball [463]manga, culminating in the first wish from Shenlong.
   The game consists of 2D overhead areas where Goku must fight many
   enemies and [464]side scrolling sequences for the boss fights.

   Although the Japanese and European editions of the game used the
   familiar art and music from the Dragon Ball [465]anime, the US edition
   is stated to be based on [466]Journey to the West with no mention of
   Dragon Ball.^[467][7] Goku was changed to more closely resemble an
   Americanized [468]Kung Fu stereotype, being pictured on the box with a
   white [469]gi and blue headband. Master Roshi, similarly has been
   changed to look more like a traditional martial arts master. Bulma is
   called "Nora", [470]Yamcha is called "Lancer", [471]Oolong is called
   "Pudgy", the Kamehameha is the "Wind Wave", and the Dragon Balls are
   referred to as "Crystalballs".

[[472]edit] Dragonradar Mobile

   Dragonradar Mobile ( ,Doragon Rd Mobairu^[473]?) is a handheld [474]LCD
   game that is produced by [475]Bandai exclusively in Japan on January
   2007 (2007-01). The game is featured in the shape of the dragon radar
   from the series and comes in either the standard white or orange colors
   which are listed as "Dragonradar Mobile: White" and "Dragonradar
   Mobile: Orange". The game features two distinct modes of play, a battle
   game and a search game. The game controls are determined by the
   player's hand movement by a motion device, and features a
   "accelerometer" that determines the strength of the players attacks by
   how hard the player shakes the device. Players can also compete with
   other players courtesy of an infrared sensor which can detect other
   radars for two player mode.
