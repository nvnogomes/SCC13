   [11]Elizabeth I and [12]James I. He was the son of [13]Thomas Hoby and
   Elizabeth Cooke, the nephew of [14]William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and
   the son-in-law of Queen Elizabeth's cousin [15]Henry Carey, 1st Baron
   Hunsdon.

   A [16]favourite of King James, Hoby published several works supporting
   the [17]Protestant cause as well as translations from the [18]French
   and [19]Spanish. His heir was his illegitimate son, [20]Peregrine Hoby.

[[27]edit] Biography

   Born at [28]Bisham Abbey, [29]Berkshire, in 1560, Edward Hoby was the
   eldest son of Sir Thomas Hoby and his wife Elizabeth, third daughter of
   Sir [30]Anthony Cooke or Coke of [31]Gidea Hall, [32]Essex. He was
   educated at [33]Eton, where he formed a lasting friendship with [34]Sir
   John Harington, and at [35]Trinity College, Oxford. At college
   [36]Thomas Lodge, the dramatist, was "servitour or scholar" under
   him.^[37][1]

   Under the auspices of his uncle, Lord Burghley,^[38][3] he rose into
   high favour at the [39]Elizabethan court, and was frequently employed
   on confidential missions.^[40][1] He married Elizabeth, daughter of
   [41]William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester in 1580; she died in
   1581^[42][4] and Hoby's fortunes were further advanced by his second
   marriage, on 21 May 1582, to Margaret, daughter of Henry Carey, 1st
   Baron Hunsdon, cousin of Queen Elizabeth. The day after the wedding he
   was knighted by the Queen.^[43][1]

   In August 1584 he accompanied his father-in-law Hunsdon on a special
   mission to [44]Scotland. His affability and learning greatly impressed
   King James VI (later James of England), and after attending the
   Scottish ambassador, [45]Patrick, Master of Gray, as far as [46]Durham,
   Hoby received from the Scottish king a flattering letter, dated 24
   October 1584, in which James intimated his longing for his company, and
   how he had "commanded his ambassador to sue for it." [47]James Stewart,
   Earl of Arran also wrote to the same effect, and enclosed a "small
   token," which he begged Hoby to wear in "testimony of their
   brotherhood". These amenities proved displeasing to Elizabeth, and Hoby
   found it convenient for a time to plead the ague as an excuse for not
   attending the court.^[48][1]

   On 24 September 1586 he was returned M.P. for [49]Queenborough, Kent,
   and gained distinction as a speaker in [50]Parliament. That October he
   complained that he had been "not only bitten but overpassed by the hard
   hand of" [51]Francis Walsingham, and appealed to Secretary [52]William
   Davison to use his influence with the queen in his behalf. Restored to
   favour, in July 1588 Hoby was chosen to report to the queen on the
   progress of the preparations against the [53]Spanish Armada. That
   October he was elected M.P. for Berkshire. He was made [54]justice of
   the peace for [55]Middlesex by a special renewal of the commission on
   17 December 1591. In 1592 he was chosen M.P. for Kent, and in 1594 was
   granted letters patent for buying and providing [56]wool for sale in
   England for ten years, and the grant was ratified in the succeeding
   reign.^[57][1]

   Hoby accompanied the [58]Earl of Essex on the expedition to [59]Cdiz in
   1596, and was made constable of Queenborough Castle, [60]Isle of
   Sheppey, Kent, on 9 July 1597. On the following 28 October Hoby
   received a commission to search out and prosecute all offences against
   the statute prohibiting the exportation of iron from England, his
   reward being half the forfeitures arising therefrom. He represented
   [61]Rochester in the parliaments of 1597, 1601, February 1604, and
   1614. James I made him a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, forgave his
   arrears of rent of the Royal Manor of [62]Shirland in [63]Derbyshire
   (amounting to over 500), and on 21 August 1607 granted him an exclusive
   license to buy wool in [64]Warwickshire and [65]Staffordshire He
   frequently entertained the king at Bisham.^[66][1]

   Hoby died in [67]Queenborough Castle, [68]Kent on 1 March 1617. Hoby
   and his wife had no children. He brought up his illegitimate son by
   Katherine Pinkney, Peregrine Hoby, and made the boy his heir.^[69][1]

[[70]edit] Works

   An excellent scholar himself, Hoby cultivated the friendship of learned
   men, especially that of [71]William Camden, who eulogises his bounty
   and accomplishments in his Britannia. Camden also dedicated his
   Hibernia (1587) to him.^[72][1]

   In 1612 Hoby presented Sir Henry Savile's sumptuous edition of St.
   Chrysostom to the library of Trinity College. Hoby was also a keen
   [73]Protestant [74]theologian, sparring in print with the [75]Roman
   Catholic convert [76]Theophilus Higgons and the [77]Jesuit [78]John
   Fludd or Floyd. ^[79][1]

   Hoby's theological writings include:
     * A Letter to Mr. T[heophilus] H[iggons], late Minister: now Fugitive
       ... in answere of his first Motive, (1609), which was answered by
       Higgons during the same year.^[80][1]
     * A Counter-snarle for Ishmael Rabshakeh a Cycropedian Lycaonite
       (1613), being a reply to The Overthrow of the Protestants Pulpet
       Babels, by "J. R." (John Floyd). Floyd forthwith rejoined with his
       Purgatories triumph over Hell, maugre the barking of Cerberus in
       Syr Edward Hobyes "Counter-snarle" (1613).^[81][1]
     * A Curry-combe for a -combe . . . In answer to a lewd Libell lately
       foricated by Jabal Rachil against Sir Edward Hobies
       "Counter-Snarle," entitled "Purgatories triumph over Hell," (1615),
       written under the ponderous pseudonym of "Nick-Groome of the
       Hobie-Stable Reginoburgi," in the form of a dialogue.^[82][1]

   Hoby also translated [83]Mathieu Coignet's Politique discourses on
   trueth and lying from French (1586), and [84]Bernardino de Mendoza's
   Theorique and Practise of Warre from Spanish (1597).^[85][1]
