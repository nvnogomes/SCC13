   The soybean (U.S.) or soya bean (UK) (Glycine max) is a species of
   [10]legume native to [11]East Asia. It is an annual plant that has been
   used in China for 5,000 years as a food and a component of drugs. Soy
   contains significant amounts of all the essential amino acids for
   humans, and so is a good source of protein. Soybeans are the primary
   ingredient in many processed foods, including dairy product
   substitutes.

[[58]edit] Overview

   Like some other crops of long domestication, the relationship of the
   modern soy bean to wild-growing species can no longer be traced with
   any degree of certainty. It is a cultural variety (a cultigen) with a
   very large number of cultivars.

   The genus [59]Glycine Wild. is divided into two subgenera (species),
   [60]Glycine and Soja. The subgenus Soja (Moench) includes the
   cultivated soybean, G. max (L.) Merrill, and the wild soybean, G. soja
   Sieb.& Zucc. Both species are [61]annual. The soybean grows only under
   cultivation while G. soja grows wild in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and
   Russia. Glycine soja is the wild ancestor of the soybean: the wild
   progenitor. At present, the subgenus Glycine consists of at least 16
   wild perennial species: for example, Glycine canescens, and G.
   tomentella Hayata found in Australia, and Papua New Guinea.^[62][1]

   Beans are classed as pulses whereas soybeans are classed as oilseeds.
   It is a versatile bean, having a diverse range of uses.

   The English word soy is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of (,
   shyu), the Japanese word for Soya sauce; soya comes from the Dutch
   adaptation of the same word.

[[63]edit] Description and physical characteristics

   Soy varies in growth, habit, and height. It may grow prostrate, not
   higher than 20 cm (7.8 inches), or grow up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) high.

   The pods, stems, and leaves are covered with fine brown or gray hairs.
   The [64]leaves are trifoliolate, having 3 to 4 leaflets per leaf, and
   the leaflets are 615 cm (26 inches) long and 27 cm (13 inches) broad.
   The leaves fall before the seeds are mature. The big, inconspicuous,
   self-fertile flowers are borne in the axil of the leaf and are white,
   pink or purple.

   The [65]fruit is a hairy [66]pod that grows in clusters of 35, each pod
   is 38 cm long(13 inches) and usually contains 24 (rarely more)
   [67]seeds 511 mm in diameter.

   Soybeans occur in various sizes, and in many [68]hull or seed coat
   colors, including black, brown, blue, yellow, green and mottled. The
   hull of the mature bean is hard, water resistant, and protects the
   [69]cotyledon and [70]hypocotyl (or "germ") from damage. If the seed
   coat is cracked, the seed will not [71]germinate. The scar, visible on
   the seed coat, is called the hilum (colors include black, brown, buff,
   gray and yellow) and at one end of the hilum is the micropyle, or small
   opening in the seed coat which can allow the absorption of water for
   sprouting.

   Remarkably, seeds such as soybeans containing very high levels of
   [72]protein can undergo [73]desiccation yet survive and revive after
   water absorption. A. Carl Leopold, son of [74]Aldo Leopold, began
   studying this capability at the [75]Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant
   Research at [76]Cornell University in the mid 1980s. He found soybeans
   and corn to have a range of soluble [77]carbohydrates protecting the
   seed's cell viability.^[78][2] Patents were awarded to him in the early
   1990s on techniques for protecting "biological membranes" and proteins
   in the dry state. Compare to [79]tardigrades.

[[80]edit] Chemical composition of the seed

   The oil and protein content together account for about 60% of dry
   soybeans by weight; protein at 40% and oil at 20%. The remainder
   consists of 35% carbohydrate and about 5% [81]ash. Soybean cultivars
   comprise approximately 8% seed coat or hull, 90% [82]cotyledons and 2%
   [83]hypocotyl axis or germ.

   The majority of [84]soy protein is a relatively heat-stable storage
   protein. This heat stability enables soya food products requiring high
   temperature cooking, such as [85]tofu, soymilk and textured vegetable
   protein (soya flour) to be made.

   The principal soluble [86]carbohydrates, [87]saccharides, of mature
   soybeans are the disaccharide [88]sucrose (range 2.58.2%), the
   trisaccharide [89]raffinose (0.11.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule
   connected to one molecule of [90]galactose, and the tetrasaccharide
   [91]stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two
   molecules of galactose. While the [92]oligosaccharides raffinose and
   stachyose protect the viability of the soy bean seed from desiccation
   (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible
   sugars and therefore contribute to [93]flatulence and abdominal
   discomfort in humans and other [94]monogastric animals; compare to the
   disaccharide [95]trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down
   in the intestine by native microbes producing gases such as carbon
   dioxide, hydrogen, methane, etc.

   Since soluble soy carbohydrates are found in the whey and are broken
   down during fermentation, soy concentrate, soy protein isolates, tofu,
   soy sauce, and sprouted soya beans are without flatus activity. On the
   other hand, there may be some beneficial effects to ingesting
   oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose, namely, encouraging
   indigenous [96]bifidobacteria in the colon against putrefactive
   bacteria.

   The insoluble carbohydrates in Soybeans consist of the complex
   polysaccharides [97]cellulose, [98]hemicellulose, and [99]pectin. The
   majority of Soybean carbohydrates can be classed as belonging to
   [100]dietary fiber.

[[101]edit] Cultivation

   Varieties of soybeans are used for many purposes.

   Soybeans are an important global crop, providing oil and protein. The
   bulk of the crop is solvent-extracted for vegetable oil and then
   defatted Soymeal is used for animal feed. A small proportion of the
   crop is consumed directly by humans. Soybean products do appear in a
   large variety of processed foods.

   Soybeans were a crucial crop in eastern [102]Asia long before written
   records, and they remain a major crop in [103]China, [104]Japan, and
   [105]Korea. Prior to fermented products such as [106]Soy sauce,
   [107]tempeh, [108]natto, and [109]miso, soy was considered sacred for
   its use in crop rotation as a method of fixing nitrogen. The plants
   would be plowed under to clear the field for food crops.^[[110]citation
   needed] Soy was first introduced to [111]Europe in the early 1700s and
   what is now the [112]United States in 1765, where it was first grown
   for hay. [113]Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter in 1770 mentioning
   sending soybeans home from England. Soybeans did not become an
   important crop outside of Asia until about 1910. In America, soy was
   considered an industrial product only and not used as a food prior to
   the 1920s. Soy was introduced in Africa from China in the late 19th
   Century and is now widespread across the continent.

   Cultivation is successful in climates with hot summers, with optimum
   growing conditions in mean temperatures of 20 C to 30 C (68F to 86F);
   temperatures of below 20 C and over 40 C (68 F, 104 F) retard growth
   significantly. They can grow in a wide range of soils, with optimum
   growth in moist alluvial soils with a good organic content. Soybeans,
   like most legumes, perform [114]nitrogen fixation by establishing a
   [115]symbiotic relationship with the bacterium [116]Bradyrhizobium
   japonicum ([117]syn. Rhizobium japonicum; Jordan 1982). However, for
   best results an inoculum of the correct strain of bacteria should be
   mixed with the Soy bean (or any legume) seed before planting. Modern
   crop [118]cultivars generally reach a height of around 1 m (3 ft), and
   take 80120 days from sowing to harvesting.

   Soybeans are native to east Asia but only 45 percent of soybean
   production is located there. The other 55 percent of production is in
   the Americas. The U.S. produced 75 million tons of soybeans in 2000, of
   which more than one-third was exported. Other leading producers are
   [129]Brazil, [130]Argentina, [131]Paraguay, [132]China, and [133]India.

   Environmental groups, such as [134]Greenpeace and the [135]WWF, have
   reported that both soybean cultivation and the probability of increased
   soybean cultivation in Brazil, has destroyed huge areas of [136]Amazon
   rainforest and is encouraging further [137]deforestation.^[138][3]
   Growing soy also requires the use of harmful [139]pesticides and
   [140]herbicides, while alternative sources of plant protein such as
   [141]hemp do not.

   American soil scientist Dr. Andrew McClung, who first showed that the
   ecologically biodiverse savannah of the [142]Cerrado region of Brazil
   could grow profitable soybeans, was awarded the 2006 [143]World Food
   Prize on October 19, 2006.^[144][4]

   The first research on soybeans in the United States was conducted by
   [145]George Washington Carver at [146]Tuskegee, Alabama, but he decided
   it was too exotic a crop for the poor black farmers of the South so he
   turned his attention to [147]peanuts.^[[148]citation needed]

[[149]edit] History

   Soybean output in 2005

   The origins of the soybean plant are obscure, but many botanists
   believe it to have derived from [150]Glycine ussuriensis, a legume
   native to central [151]China.^[152][5] The soybean has been used in
   China for 5,000 years as a food and a component of drugs. According to
   the ancient Chinese, in 2853 BC the legendary [153]Emperor Shennong of
   China named five sacred plants soybeans, rice, wheat, barley, and
   [154]millet.^[155][6] Cultivation of soybeans, long confined chiefly to
   China, gradually spread to other countries.^[156][7]

   According to other sources, the earliest preserved soybeans were
   unearthed from [157]archaeological sites in
   [158]Korea.^[159][8]^[160][9] [161]Radiocarbon dating of soybean
   recovered through [162]flotation during excavations at the Early
   [163]Mumun Period Okbang site in Korea indicates that soybean was
   cultivated as a food crop in ca. 1000900 BC.^[164][10] The best current
   evidence on the Japanese Archipelago suggests that soybean cultivation
   occurred in the early [165]Yayoi period.

   From about the first century AD to the [166]Age of Discovery (15-16th
   century), soybeans were introduced into several countries such as
   [167]Japan, [168]Indonesia, the [169]Philippines, [170]Vietnam,
   [171]Thailand, [172]Malaysia, [173]Burma, [174]Taiwan, [175]Nepal and
   [176]India. This spread was due to the establishment of sea and land
   trade routes. The earliest Japanese textual reference to the soybean is
   in the classic [177]Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters) which was
   completed in 712 AD.

   Soy took on a very important role in the [178]United States after
   [179]World War I. During the [180]Great Depression, the drought
   stricken ([181]Dust Bowl) regions of the [182]United States were able
   to use soy to regenerate their soil because of its nitrogen-fixing
   properties. Farms were increasing production in order to meet with
   government demands, and [183]Henry Ford was a great leader of the
   soybean industry.

   In 1932-33 the Ford Motor Company spent approximately $1,250,000 on
   soybean research. By 1935 every Ford car had soy involved in its
   manufacture. For example, the soybean oil was used to paint the
   automobiles as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford scientists had
   developed a fiber{see below} from [184]soy protein which was wool-like,
   very soft, and chosen to be used for the making of suits, felt hats,
   and overcoats. Ford himself wore a suit made entirely from soybeans, he
   was even said to have had dinner parties with nothing but soybean based
   foods on the menu. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many
   doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than it
   ever had before.

   [185]Henry Ford promoted the soybean, helping to develop uses for it
   both in food and in industrial products, even demonstrating auto body
   panels made of soy-based plastics. Ford's interest led to two bushels
   of soybeans being used in each Ford car as well as products like the
   first commercial [186]soy milk, ice cream and all-vegetable non-dairy
   whipped topping. The Ford development of so-called soy-based plastics
   was based on the addition of soybean flour and wood flour to
   [187]phenolformaldehyde plastics.

   In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert to produce
   artificial silk. They succeeded in making a textile fiber of spun soy
   protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a [188]formaldehyde bath which
   was given the name [189]Azlon by the Federal Trade Commission. Pilot
   production of Azlon reached 5000 pounds per day in 1940, but never
   reached the commercial market.

   During [190]World War II, soybeans became important in both [191]North
   America and [192]Europe chiefly as substitutes for other protein foods
   and as a source of edible oil. It was during [193]World War II that the
   soybean was discovered as fertilizer by the [194]Department of
   Agriculture. In the 1960-1 Dillion round of the [195]GATT the United
   States secured tariff-free access for it's soybeans in the European
   market. In the 1960s the United States exported over 90% of the worlds
   soybeans. .^[196][11]. ^[197][12]. In the United States they are now a
   leading crop, and [198]Brazil, [199]Argentina, and [200]Paraguay also
   are significant soybean-exporting nations.

   Many people have claimed that soybeans in Asia, prior to modern times,
   were only used after a fermentation process, which alters the high
   increase in phytoestrogens found in the raw plant. However, this
   appears to be incorrect: Terms similar to "[201]soy milk" have been in
   use since 82 AD [202][3], and there is evidence of [203]tofu
   consumption that dates to 220. [204][4]

   The genus name Glycine was originally introduced by [205]Linnaeus
   (1737) in his first edition of [206]Genera Plantarum. The word
   [207]glycine is derived from the Greek-glykys (sweet) and very likely
   refers to the sweetness of the [208]pear-shaped (apios in Greek) edible
   tubers produced by the native North American twining or climbing
   herbaceous [209]legume, Glycine apios, now known as [210]Apios
   americana. Alternative names include: [211]ground nut, American potato
   bean, wild bean, Indian potato, ground bean, hopniss, and sea vines.
   The seeds are also edible. The cultivated soybean first appeared in the
   [212]Species Plantarum, Linnaeus, under the name [213]Phaseolus max L.
   The combination, Glycine max(L.) Merr., as proposed by Merrill in 1917,
   has become the valid name for this useful plant.

[[214]edit] Soybean diseases

          Main article: [215]List of soybean diseases

[[216]edit] Genetic modification

   Soybeans are one of the "[217]biotech food" crops that have been
   [218]genetically modified, and genetically modified soybeans are being
   used in an increasing number of products. In 1995 [219]Monsanto
   introduced [220]Roundup Ready (RR) soybeans that have been genetically
   modified to be resistant to the herbicide [221]Roundup through
   substitution of the [222]Agrobacterium sp. (strain CP4) [223]gene EPSP
   (5-enolpyruvyl shikimic acid-3-phosphate) synthase. The substituted
   version is not sensitive to [224]glyphosate.^[225][13]

   In 1997, about 8% of all soybeans cultivated for the commercial market
   in the United States were genetically modified. In 2006, the figure was
   89%. As with other "Roundup Ready" crops, concern is expressed over
   damage to [226]biodiversity.^[227][14] However, the RR gene has been
   bred into so many different soybean cultivars that the genetic
   modification itself has not resulted in any decline of genetic
   diversity, as demonstrated by a 2003 study on genetic
   diversity.^[228][15]

   The widespread use of such types of GM soybeans in the Americas has
   caused problems with exports to some regions. GM crops require
   extensive certification before they can be legally imported into the
   [229]European Union, where there is considerable supplier and consumer
   reluctance to use GM products for consumer or animal use. Difficulties
   with [230]coexistence and subsequent traces of cross-contamination of
   non-GM stocks have caused shipments to be rejected and have put a
   premium on non-GM soy.^[231][16]

[[232]edit] Uses

   Soybeans can be broadly classified as "vegetable" (garden) or field
   (oil) types. Vegetable types cook more easily, have a mild nutty
   flavor, better texture, are larger in size, higher in protein, and
   lower in oil than field types. [233]Tofu and [234]soymilk producers
   prefer the higher protein cultivars bred from vegetable soybeans
   originally brought to the United States in the late 1930s. The "garden"
   cultivars are generally not suitable for mechanical combine harvesting
   because they have a tendency for the pods to shatter on reaching
   maturity.

   Among the legumes, the soybean, also classed as an oilseed, is
   pre-eminent for its high (3845%) [235]protein content as well as its
   high (20%) oil content. Soybeans are the leading agricultural export in
   the United States. The bulk of the soybean crop is grown for oil
   production, with the high-protein defatted and "toasted" soy meal used
   as livestock feed. A smaller percentage of soybeans are used directly
   for human consumption.

   Immature soybeans may be boiled whole in their green pod and served
   with [236]salt, under the Japanese name [237]edamame edamame (
   ^[238]?). Because of the proclaimed health benefits of soy,
   [239]edamame has been featured as an ideal snack alternative in fitness
   and healthy living magazines such as [240]Real Simple. Edamame is sold
   in the frozen vegetable section at some larger grocery stores, and as
   ready-to-eat snackfood in many Asian delis.

   In [241]China, [242]Japan, and [243]Korea the bean and products made
   from the bean are a popular part of the diet. The Chinese invented
   [244]tofu (), and also made use of several varieties of [245]soybean
   paste as seasonings. Japanese foods made from soya include [246]miso
   (), [247]natto (), [248]kinako () and [249]edamame (). In [250]Korean
   cuisine, soybean sprouts, called [251]kongnamul () are also used in a
   variety of dishes such as [252]doenjang, [253]cheonggukjang and
   [254]ganjang.

   The beans can be processed in a variety of ways. Common forms of soy
   (or soya) include soy meal, [255]soy flour, [256]soy milk, [257]tofu,
   [258]textured vegetable protein (TVP, which is made into a wide variety
   of [259]vegetarian foods, some of them intended to imitate [260]meat),
   [261]tempeh, soy [262]lecithin and [263]soybean oil. Soybeans are also
   the primary ingredient involved in the production of [264]soy sauce (or
   shoyu).
   Soybeans grow throughout Asia and North and South America.
   Soybean fields in the United States

   [265]Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is among the largest processors of
   soybeans and soy products. ADM along with [266]Dow Chemical Company,
   [267]DuPont and [268]Monsanto support the industry trade associations
   [269]United Soybean Board (USB) and [270]Soyfoods Association of North
   America (SANA). These trade associations have increased the consumption
   of soy products dramatically in recent years.

[[271]edit] Oil

   In processing soybeans for [272]oil extraction and subsequent soy flour
   production, selection of high quality, sound, clean, dehulled yellow
   soybeans are very important. Soybeans having a dark colored seed coat,
   or even beans with a dark hilum will inadvertently leave dark specks in
   the flour, and are undesirable for use in commercial food products. All
   commercial soybeans in the United States are yellow or yellow brown.

   To produce soybean oil, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture
   content, rolled into flakes and solvent-extracted with commercial
   [273]hexane. The oil is then refined, blended for different
   applications, and sometimes [274]hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both
   liquid and partially hydrogenated, are exported abroad, sold as
   "vegetable oil," or end up in a wide variety of processed foods. The
   remaining soybean husks are used mainly as animal feed.

   The major [275]unsaturated fatty acids in soybean oil
   [276]triglycerides are 7% [277]linolenic acid (C18:3); 51%
   [278]linoleic acid (C-18:2); and 23% [279]oleic acid(C-18:1). It also
   contains the saturated fatty acids 4% [280]stearic acid and 10%
   [281]palmitic acid.

   Soybean oil has a relatively high proportion, 710%, of oxidation prone
   linolenic acid, which is an undesirable property for continuous
   service, such as in a restaurant. In the early nineties, Iowa State
   University developed soybean oil with 1% linolenic acid in the oil.
   Three companies, [282]Monsanto, [283]DuPont/[284]Bunge, and [285]Asoyia
   in 2004 introduced low linolenic, (C18:3; cis-9, cis-12, cis-15
   octadecatrienoic acid) [286]Roundup Ready soybeans. In the past,
   [287]hydrogenation was used to reduce the unsaturation in linolenic
   acid, but this produced the unnatural [288]trans-fatty acid
   configuration, whereas in nature the configuration is [289]cis (see
   [290]trans fat). This external [291]picture from North Dakota State
   University compares soybean oil fatty acid content with other oils.

   In the 20022003 growing season, 30.6 million [292]tons of soybean oil
   were produced worldwide, constituting about half of worldwide edible
   vegetable oil production, and thirty percent of all fats and oils
   produced, including animal fats and oils derived from tropical
   plants.^[293][17]

   While soybean oil has no direct [294]insect repellent activity, it is
   used as a [295]fixative to extend the short duration of action of
   [296]essential oils such as [297]geranium oil in several commercial

          Main article: [301]Soybean meal

   Soybean meal, the material remaining after solvent extraction of
   soybean flakes, with a 50% [302]soy protein content, toasted (a
   [303]misnomer because the heat treatment is with moist steam) and
   ground in a [304]hammer mill, provided the energy for the American
   production method, beginning in the 1930s, of growing farm animals such
   as [305]poultry and [306]swine on an industrial scale; and more
   recently the [307]aquaculture of [308]catfish.

[[309]edit] Flour

   Soy flour refers to defatted soybeans where special care was taken
   during desolventizing (not toasted) in order to minimize
   [310]denaturation of the protein to retain a high Nitrogen Solubility
   Index (NSI), for uses such as extruder texturizing (TVP). It is the
   starting material for production of soy concentrate and soy protein
   isolate.
     * Defatted soy flour is obtained from solvent extracted flakes, and
       contains less than 1% oil.
     * Full-fat soy flour is made from unextracted, dehulled beans, and
       contains about 18% to 20% oil. Due to its high oil content a
       specialized Alpine Fine Impact Mill must be used for grinding
       rather than the more common hammer mill.
     * Low-fat soy flour is made by adding back some oil to defatted soy
       flour. The lipid content varies according to specifications,
       usually between 4.5% and 9%.
     * High-fat soy flour can also be produced by adding back soybean oil
       to defatted flour at the level of 15%.
     * Lecithinated soy flour is made by adding soybean [311]lecithin to
       defatted, low-fat or high-fat soy flours to increase their
       dispersibility and impart emulsifying properties. The lecithin
       content varies up to 15%.

[[312]edit] Infant formula

   [313]Infant formulas based on soy (SBIF) are used by lactose-intolerant
   babies and for babies that are allergic to cow milk proteins. The
   formulas are sold in powdered, ready-to-feed, or concentrated liquid
   forms.

   Some reviews express the opinion that more research is needed to answer
   the question of what effect the phytoestrogens contained in soy formula
   may have on infants,^[314][20] but did not find any adverse effects.
   Diverse studies conclude there are no adverse effects in human growth,
   development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of
   soy-based infant formula.^[315][21]^[316][22]^[317][23] One of these
   studies, published at the Journal of Nutrition,^[318][23] concludes
   that:

     ...there is no clinical concerns with respect to nutritional
     adequacy, sexual development, neurobehavioral development, immune
     development, or thyroid disease. SBIFs provide complete nutrition
     that adequately supports normal infant growth and development. FDA
     has accepted SBIFs as safe for use as the sole source of nutrition.

[[319]edit] Substitute for existing products

   Open package of a soy-based cream cheese alternative with chives

   Soybeans are the primary ingredient in many processed foods, including
   [320]dairy product substitutes (e.g., [321]margarine, [322]soy ice
   cream, [323]soy milk, [324]soy yogurt, [325]soy cheese and [326]soy
   cream cheese), as well as [327]Crisco, [328]soybean oil, [329]tofu,
   [330]veggie burgers, soynut butter, soy crisps, among others. Soybeans
   are processed to produce a texture and appearance similar to other
   foods (e.g., [331]butter, [332]ice cream, [333]milk, [334]yogurt,
   [335]cheese, [336]lard, [337]olive oil, [338]ground beef, [339]peanut
   butter, [340]potato chips, etc.) and are readily available in most
   [341]supermarkets. Soy milk does not contain significant amounts of
   [342]calcium, since the high calcium content of soybeans is bound to
   the insoluble constituents and remains in the [343]pulp. Many
   manufacturers of soy milk now sell calcium-enriched products as well.

   Soy products also are used to extend meat and poultry products in food
   service, retail and institutional (primarily school lunch and
   correctional) channels. Extension can result in diminished or off
   flavors, but fat and cholesterol, as well as cost, are reduced. Vitamin
   and mineral fortification can be used to make soy equivalent to the
   animal protein source; the protein quality is already roughly
   equivalent.

[[344]edit] Other products

   Soybeans are the bean used in Chinese fermented black beans,
   [345]douchi, not the sometimes confused [346]black turtle beans.

   Soybeans are also used in industrial products including oils,
   [347]soap, [348]cosmetics, [349]resins, [350]plastics, [351]inks,
   [352]crayons, [353]solvents, and [354]clothing. Soybean oil is the
   primary source of [355]biodiesel in the United States, accounting for
   80% of domestic biodiesel production.^[356][24] Soybeans have also been
   used since 2001 as fermenting stock in the manufacture of a brand of
   [357]vodka.^[358][25]

   Today, very high quality textile fibers are made commercially from
   "okara" ([359]soy pulp), a by-product of [360]tofu production.

[[384]edit] Protein, vitamins, and minerals

          Main article: [385]soy protein

   Soybeans are considered by many agencies, including the US Food and
   Drug Administration, to be a source of [386]complete protein.^[387][26]
   A complete protein is one that contains significant amounts of all the
   [388]essential amino acids that must be provided to the [389]human body
   because of the body's inability to [390]synthesize them. For this
   reason, soy is a good source of protein, amongst many others, for many
   [391]vegetarians and [392]vegans or for people who cannot afford meat.

   According to the FDA, "[393]Soy protein products can be good
   substitutes for animal products because, unlike some other beans, soy
   offers a "complete" protein profile. Soybeans contain all the amino
   acids essential to human nutrition, which must be supplied in the diet
   because they cannot be synthesized by the human body. Soy protein
   products can replace animal-based foods--which also have complete
   proteins but tend to contain more fat, especially saturated
   fat--without requiring major adjustments elsewhere in the diet."

   However, as with any dietary health claim, there are opposing
   viewpoints on the health benefits of
   soybeans.^[394][27]^[395][28]^[396][29]

   The gold standard for measuring protein quality, since 1990, is the
   [397]Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) and by
   this criterion [398]soy protein is the nutritional equivalent of meat
   and eggs for [399]human growth and health. Soybean protein isolate has
   a [400]Biological Value of 74, whole soybeans 96, soybean milk 91, and
   eggs 97.^[401][30]

   [402]Soy protein is essentially identical to that of other legume
   [403]pulses seeds.^[404][31] Moreover, it has the highest yield per
   square meter of growing area, and is the least expensive source of
   dietary protein.^[[405]citation needed]

   Consumption of soy may also reduce the risk of [406]colon cancer,
   possibly due to the presence of [407]sphingolipids.^[408][32]

[[409]edit] Role of soyfoods in disease prevention

[[410]edit] Omega-3 fatty acids

   Roasted soybeans

   [411]Omega-3 fatty acids, for example, [412]alpha-linolenic acid C18-3,
   all cis, 9,12,15 octadecatrienoic acid (where the omega-3 refers to
   carbon number 3 counting from the hydrocarbon tail whereas C-15 refers
   to carbon number 15 counting from the carboxyl acid head) are special
   fat components that benefit many body functions. However, the effects
   which are beneficial to health are associated mainly with the
   longer-chain, more unsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3,
   EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) found in fish oil and oily
   fish. For instance, EPA and DHA, inhibit blood clotting, while there is
   no evidence that alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) can do this. Soybean oil
   is one of the few common vegetable oils that contains a significant
   amount of aLNA; others include [413]canola, [414]walnut, [415]hemp, and
   [416]flax. However, soybean oil does not contain EPA or DHA. Soybean
   oil does contain significantly greater amount of [417]omega-6 fatty
   acids in the oil: 100g of soybean oil contains 7g of omega-3 fatty
   acids to 51g of omega-6: a ratio of 1:7. Flaxseed, in comparison, has
   an omega-3:omega-6 ratio of 3:1.

[[418]edit] Isoflavones

          Main article: [419]Isoflavone

   Soybeans also contain the [420]isoflavones [421]genistein and
   [422]daidzein, types of [423]phytoestrogen, that are considered by some
   nutritionists and physicians to be useful in the prevention of cancer
   and by others to be carcinogenic^[[424]citation needed] and endocrine
   disruptive^[[425]citation needed]. Soy's content of isoflavones are as
   much as 3 mg/g dry weight.^[[426]citation needed] [427]Isoflavones are
   [428]polyphenol compounds, produced primarily by beans and other
   legumes, including [429]peanuts and [430]chickpeas. Isoflavones are
   closely related to the antioxidant [431]flavonoids found in other
   plants, vegetables and flowers. Isoflavones such as genistein and
   daidzein are found in only some plant families, because most plants do
   not have an enzyme, chalcone isomerase which converts a flavone
   precursor into an isoflavone. In contradiction to well known benefits
   of isoflavones, Genistein acts as an oxidant (stimulating nitrate
   synthesis),^[432][33] as well as it blocks formation of new blood
   vessels (antiangiogenic effects).^[433][34] Some studies show Genistein
   to act as inhibitor of the activity of substances in the body that
   regulate cell division and cell survival (growth factors).

[[434]edit] Claims of cholesterol reduction

   The dramatic increase in soyfood sales is largely credited to the
   [435]Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of soy as an
   official cholesterol-lowering food, along with other heart and health
   benefits.^[436][35] A 2001 [437]literature review argued that these
   health benefits were poorly supported by the available evidence, and
   noted that disturbing data on soy's effect on the cognitive function of
   the elderly existed.^[438][36] In 2008, an epidemiological study of 719
   Japanese men found that tofu intake was associated with worse memory,
   but [439]tempeh (a fermented soy product) intake was associated with
   better memory.^[440][37] This study replicated other studies.

   From 1992 to 2003, sales have experienced a 15% [441]compound annual
   growth rate, increasing from $300 million to $3.9 billion over 11
   years, as new soyfood categories have been introduced, soyfoods have
   been repositioned in the market place, thanks to a better emphasis on
   marketing nutrition.

   In 1995, the New England Journal of Medicine (Vol. 333, No. 5)
   published a meta-analysis financed by DuPont Protein Technologies
   International (PIT), which produces and markets soy through [442]The
   Solae Company. The meta-analysis concluded that soy protein is
   correlated with significant decreases in serum cholesterol, [443]LDL
   (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. However, [444]HDL(good
   cholesterol) did not increase by a significant amount. Soy
   [445]phytoestrogens ([446]isoflavones: genistein and daidzein)
   [447]adsorbed onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing
   serum cholesterol levels. On the basis of this research PTI filed a
   petition with FDA in 1998 for a health claim that soy protein may
   reduce cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.

   The FDA granted the following health claim for soy: "25 grams of soy
   protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol,
   may reduce the risk of heart disease."^[448][38] One serving, (1 cup or
   240 mL) of soy milk, for instance, contains 6 or 7 grams of soy
   protein. Solae resubmitted their original petition, asking for a more
   vague health claim, after their original was challenged and highly
   criticized. Solae also submitted a petition for a health claim that soy
   can help prevent cancer. They quickly withdrew the petition for lack of
   evidence and after more than 1,000 letters of protest were received. In
   February 18, 2008 Weston A. Price Foundation submitted a petition for
   removal of this health claim.^[449][39]

   In January 2006 an American Heart Association review (in the journal
   "Circulation") of a decade long study of soy protein benefits casts
   doubt on the FDA allowed "Heart Healthy" claim for soy protein and did
   not recommend isoflavone supplementation. The review panel also found
   that soy isoflavones have not been shown to reduce post menopause "hot
   flashes" in women and the efficacy and safety of isoflavones to help
   prevent cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate is in
   question.^[450][40]

[[451]edit] Health risks

[[452]edit] Phytoestrogen

          Main article: [453]Phytoestrogens

   Soybeans contain [454]isoflavones called [455]genistein and
   [456]daidzein, which are one source of [457]phytoestrogens in the human
   diet. Because most naturally occurring estrogenic substances show weak
   activity, normal consumption of foods that contain these phytoestrogens
   should not provide sufficient amounts to elicit a physiological
   response in humans.^[[458]citation needed]

   Plant [459]lignans associated with high fiber foods such as cereal
   brans and beans are the principal precursor to mammalian lignans which
   have an ability to bind to human estrogen sites. Soybeans are a
   significant source of mammalian lignan precursor
   [460]secoisolariciresinol containing 13273 g/100 g dry
   weight.^[461][41] Another phytoestrogen in the human diet with estrogen
   activity is [462]coumestans, which are found in beans, split-peas, with
   the best sources being alfalfa, clover, and soybean sprouts.
   [463]Coumestrol, an isoflavone [464]coumarin derivative is the only
   coumestan in foods.^[465][42]^[466][43]

   Soybeans and processed soy foods do not contain the highest "total
   phytoestrogen" content of foods. A study in which data were presented
   on an as-is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving found that food
   groups from highest to lowest levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g
   are nuts and oilseeds, soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat
   products, various processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, and
   fruits.^[467][44]

[[468]edit] Women

   A 2001 literature review suggested that women with current or past
   breast cancer should be aware of the risks of potential tumor growth
   when taking soy products, based on the effect of phytoestrogens to
   promote [469]breast cancer cell growth in animals.^[470][45]

   A 2006 commentary reviewed the relationship with soy and breast cancer.
   They stated that soy may prevent breast cancer, but cautioned that the
   impact of isoflavones on breast tissue needs to be evaluated at the
   cellular level in women at high risk for breast cancer.^[471][46]

   A high consumption of [472]omega-6 [473]polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   which are found in most types of [474]vegetable oil including soybean
   oil, may increase the likelihood that postmenopausal women will develop
   breast cancer^[475][47]. Other analysis suggested an inverse
   association between total polyunsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer
   risk^[476][48].

[[477]edit] Men

   Because of the phytoestrogen content, some studies, but not all, have
   suggested that there is an inverse correlation between soybean
   ingestion and [478]testosterone in men.^[479][49] For this reason, they
   may protect against the development of prostate cancer.^[480][50] A
   theoretical decrease in the risk of prostate cancer should, however, be
   weighed against the possible side-effects of decreased testosterone,
   which are still unclear. The popular fear that soybeans might cause
   reduced libido and even feminine characteristics in men has not been
   indicated by any study; the popularity of the notion seems to be based
   on the simplistic misapprehension that estrogen and testosterone have a
   simple, inverse relationship in sexual hormone systems and sex-related
   behaviour.^[[481]citation needed] Their interplay is very complicated
   and largely still unknown.^[482][51]

   A study published in April 2008 concluded that soy food intake has an
   inverse association with sperm concentration in fertility-deficient
   men. The same study found that soy intake does not affect sperm
   motility, morphology or ejaculate volume.^[483][52]

[[484]edit] Infant formula

   There are some studies that state that phytoestrogen in soy can lead to
   alterations in the proliferation and migration of [485]intestinal
   cells. The effects of these alterations are unknown.^[486][53] However,
   some studies conclude there are no adverse effects in human growth,
   development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of
   soy-based infant formula.^[487][54] Other reviews agree, but state that
   more research is needed to answer the question of what effect
   phytoestrogens have on infants.^[488][55]^[489][56] Soy formula has
   also been linked to [490]autoimmune disorders of the [491]thyroid
   gland.^[492][57]

[[493]edit] Allergy

          Main article: [494]Soy allergy

   Allergy to soy is often said to be rather common, and the food is
   listed with other foods that commonly cause allergy, such as milk,
   eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish. However, a critical review of
   medical literature reveals surprisingly little solid information on the
   topic. The problem has been reported amongst younger children and the
   diagnosis of soy allergy is often based on symptoms reported by parents
   and/or results of skin tests or blood tests for allergy. Only a few
   reported studies have attempted to confirm allergy to soy by direct
   challenge with the food under controlled conditions. In these
   circumstances it is clear that skin/blood tests considerably
   overestimate the problem, as do parental reports.^[495][58] It is very
   difficult to give a reliable estimate of the true prevalence of soy
   allergy in the general population. To the extent that it does exist,
   soy allergy may cause cases of urticaria (hives) and angioedema
   (swelling), usually within minutes to two hours of ingestion of the
   food. In rare, severe cases true anaphylaxis may occur, a condition
   that is much more common with allergy to foods such as peanut and
   shellfish. The reason for the discrepancy is likely that soy proteins,
   the causative factor in allergy, are far less potent at triggering
   allergy symptoms than the proteins of peanut and shellfish.^[496][59]
   An allergy test that is positive demonstrates that the immune system
   has formed IgE antibodies to soy proteins. However, when soy is
   ingested proteins must evade digestion and be absorbed in a form
   capable of triggering allergy and also in sufficient quantities to
   reach a threshold to provoke actual symptoms. The low potency of soy
   proteins as allergens may help explain why allergy skin/blood tests
   suggest that soy allergy is common, yet few cases are confirmed when
   the food is eaten under observation.

   Soy can also trigger symptoms via [497]food intolerance, a situation
   where no immunologic (allergic) mechanism can be proven. One scenario
   is seen in very young infants who have vomiting and diarrhoea when fed
   soy-based formula. The symptoms resolve when the formula is withdrawn
   and recur when it is re-administered. Older infants can suffer a more
   severe disorder with vomiting, diarrhoea that may be bloody, anemia,
   weight loss and failure to thrive. The commonest cause of this unusual
   disorder is a sensitivity to cow's milk, but there is no doubt that soy
   formulas can also be the trigger. The precise mechanism is unclear and
   it could be immunologic, although not through the IgE-type antibodies
   that have the leading role in urticaria and anaphylaxis. Fortunately it
   is also self-limiting and will often disappear in the toddler
   years.^[498][60]

[[499]edit] Promotion as health food

   Soy consumption has been promoted by natural food companies and the soy
   industry's aggressive marketing campaign in various magazines,
   television ads and in health food markets. Research has been conducted
   examining the validity of the beneficial health claims with regard to
   the increase in consumption of soybeans which mimic hormonal activity.

   A practice guideline published in the journal Circulation questions the
   efficacy and safety of soy isoflavones for preventing or treating
   cancer of the breast, endometrium, and prostate (although the same
   study also concludes that soy in some foods should be beneficial to
   cardiovascular and overall health) and does not recommend usage of
   isoflavone supplements in food or pills.^[500][61] A review of the
   available studies by the United States' [501]Health and Human Services'
   [502]Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found little
   evidence of substantial health improvements and no adverse effects, but
   also noted that there was no long-term safety data on estrogenic
   effects from soy consumption.^[503][62]

[[504]edit] Brain

   Estrogen helps protect and repair the brain during and after
   injury.^[505][63] The mimicry of estrogen by the phytoestrogens in soy
   has introduced a controversy over whether such a replacement is harmful
   or helpful to the brain. Several studies have found soy to be harmful
   for rats.^[506][64] Nevertheless the cited study was based on rats fed
   with concentrated phytoestrogens and not common soybeans. The common
   amounts of phytoestrogens in soy beans are not to be compared to
   concentrated estrogen. One study followed over 3000 [507]Japanese men
   between 1965 and 1999, and that showed a positive correlation between
   brain atrophy and consumption of tofu.^[508][65]. This study by L.R.
   White, et al., from the National Institute of Aging, [509]NIH, was
   rejected as not credible by the [510]Food and Drug
   Administration.^[511][66] A study on elderly Indonesian men and women
   found that tempeh consumption was independently related to better
   memory.^[512][67]

[[513]edit] Carcinogen

   Raw [514]soy flour is known to cause [515]pancreatic cancer in
   rats.^[516][68] Whether this is also true in humans is unknown because
   no studies comparing cases of pancreatic cancer and soy intake in
   humans have yet been conducted, and the doses used to induce pancreatic
   cancer in rats are said to be larger than humans would normally
   consume. Heated soy flour may not be [517]carcinogenic in
   rats.^[518][69]^[519][70] Existing cancer patients are being warned to
   avoid foods rich in soy because they can accelerate the growth of
   tumours.^[520][71]

[[521]edit] Soybean futures

   Soybean [522]futures are traded on the [523]Chicago Board of Trade and
   have delivery dates in January (F), March (H), May (K), July (N),
   August (Q), September (U), November (X).^[524][72]
   It is also traded on other commodity futures exchanges under different
   contract specifications:
   - SAFEX: [525]The South African Futures Exchange [526][5]
   - DC: [527]Dalian Commodity Exchange [528][6]
