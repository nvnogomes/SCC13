   Donald in Mathmagic Land is a 27 minute Donald Duck [33]featurette
   released on June 26, 1959. It was directed by [34]Hamilton Luske.
   Contributors included [35]Disney artists John Hench and Art Riley,
   voice talent Paul Frees, and scientific expert [36]Heinz Haber, who had
   worked on the Disney space shows. It was released on a bill with
   [37]Darby O'Gill and the Little People. In 1959, it was nominated for
   an Academy Award ([38]Best Documentary - Short Subjects). ^[39][1] In
   1961, two years after its release, it had the honor of being introduced
   by [40]Ludwig Von Drake and shown on the first program of Walt Disney's
   [41]Wonderful World of Color. The film was made available to schools
   and became one of the most popular [42]educational films ever made by
   Disney. As Walt Disney explained, "The cartoon is a good medium to
   stimulate interest. We have recently explained mathematics in a film
   and in that way excited public interest in this very important
   subject."^[43][2]

[[58]edit] Story

[[59]edit] Entrance

   Donald Duck, holding a hunting rifle, passes through a doorway to find
   that he has entered Mathmagic Land. This fantasy land contains trees
   with [60]"square roots", a stream flowing with numbers, and a walking
   pencil that plays [61]tic-tac-toe. Interestingly, a geometric bird
   recites (incorrectly) the first 15 digits of [62]pi. Donald soon hears
   the voice of the "True Spirit of Adventure" who will guide Donald on
   his journey through Mathmagic Land.

[[63]edit] Pythagoras and music

   Donald is initially not interested in Mathmagic Land, believing that
   math is for "eggheads". When "Mr. Spirit" suggests a connection between
   math and music, though, Donald is intrigued. First, Donald discovers
   the relationships between [64]octaves and string length. Next, Donald
   finds himself in ancient Greece, where Pythagoras and his
   contemporaries are discovering these same relationships. Pythagoras (on
   the harp), a flute player, and a [65]double bass player hold a "jam
   session" which Donald joins after a few moments using a [66]vase as a
   [67]bongo drum. Pythagoras' music is, as the Spirit explains, the basis
   of today's music, and that music would not exist without "eggheads".

[[68]edit] The pentagram, the golden section, and the golden rectangle

   After shaking hands with Pythagoras, Donald finds on his hand a
   pentagram, the symbol of the secret [69]Pythagorean society. The Spirit
   then shows Donald how the mysterious golden section appears in the
   pentagram. Next, the pentagram is shown to contain the pattern for
   constructing golden rectangles many times over. According to the
   Spirit, the golden rectangle has influenced both ancient and modern
   cultures in many ways.

[[70]edit] Architecture and art

   Donald learns how the golden rectangle appears in many ancient
   buildings, such as the [71]Parthenon and the [72]Notre Dame cathedral.
   Paintings such as the Mona Lisa and various sculptures contain several
   golden rectangles. The use of the golden rectangle is found in modern
   architecture, such as the [73]United Nations building in New York City.

[[74]edit] The human body and nature

   The Spirit shows Donald how the golden rectangle and pentagram are
   related to the human body and nature, respectively. The human body
   contains the "ideal proportions" of the golden section; Donald tries to
   make his own body fit such a proportion, but his efforts are to no
   avail. The pentagram (more accurately, the [75]pentagon) is then shown
   to be found in many flowers and animals, such as the [76]petunia, the
   [77]star jasmine, the starfish, the [78]wax flower, and sea shells.

[[79]edit] Games

   Donald learns that mathematics applies not only to nature,
   architecture, and music, but also to games, including chess, baseball,
   football, basketball, hopscotch, and three-cushion billiards. Donald
   even volunteers the game Tiddlywinks, but the Spirit does not pursue
   this option. Themes of [80]Lewis Carroll's [81]Through the Looking
   Glass are scattered throughout the chess scene; Carroll himself was
   both a writer and a [82]mathematician. The extended billiards scene
   describes the calculations involved in the game's "diamond system," but
   Donald never fully grasps how to do the calculations himself.

[[83]edit] Mental exercises

   The Spirit then asks Donald to play a mental game, but he finds
   Donald's mind to be too cluttered. After some mental house-cleaning,
   Donald plays with a circle and a triangle in his mind, and he discovers
   useful inventions such as the wheel, train, magnifying glass, drill,
   propeller, and telescope.

[[84]edit] [85]Infinity and the future

   Donald discovers that pentagrams can be drawn inside each other
   indefinitely. Therefore, mathematics provides an avenue to consider the
   infinite. The Spirit states that scientific knowledge and technological
   advances are unlimited, and the key to unlocking the doors of the
   future is mathematics. By the end of the film, Donald understands and
   appreciates the value of mathematics. The film closes with a quote from
   [86]Galileo: "Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written
   the universe."

[[87]edit] Cast

   [88]Paul Frees - The True Spirit of Adventure / Narrator (voice)
   [89]Clarence Nash - Donald Duck (voice)

[[90]edit] Goofs

   Despite this being a mathematics educational film, a character
   incorrectly recites the value of the [91]mathematical constant [92]pi.
   The character states, "Pi is equal to 3.141592653589747, et cetera, et
   cetera, et cetera." The correct value of pi (to the same amount of
   digits) is actually 3.141592653589793.

[[93]edit] DVD release

   On July 30, 2007, the region 1 DVD of Donald in Mathmagic Land was
   released as an exclusive to the [94]Disney Movie Club.

   Donald in Mathmagic Land is available (but not digitally remastered) on
   DVD in Region 2 as the first insert of Vol. 3 of the "Walt Disney's
   Fables" series. The disk also includes [95]Ben and Me and [96]Modern
   Inventions.

   "Donald in Mathmagic Land" is available on the DVD "The Chronological
   Donald, vol. 4" in the [97]Walt Disney Treasures series of DVDs.
