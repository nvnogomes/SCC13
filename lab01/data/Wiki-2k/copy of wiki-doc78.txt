   [9]J. R. "Bob" Dobbs

   The Church of the SubGenius is a religious group satirizing
   [10]religion, [11]conspiracy theories, [12]UFOs, and [13]popular
   culture. Originally based in [14]Dallas, [15]Texas, the Church of the
   SubGenius gained prominence in the 1980s and 1990s [16]subculture and
   maintains an active presence on the Internet. Publicly accessible cited
   figures from 1988 indicated a membership of 3500^[17][1] at that time
   and "more than 5000"^[18][2] by 1990.

[[37]edit] History

   The Church of the SubGenius claims to have been founded in the 1950s by
   the world's greatest salesman [38]J. R. "Bob" Dobbs. "Bob" Dobbs is
   depicted as a cartoon of a [39]Ward Cleaver-like man smoking a pipe.
   The church really started with the publication of SubGenius Pamphlet #1
   in 1979. It found acceptance in underground pop-culture circles and has
   been embraced on college campuses, in the [40]underground music scene,
   and on the [41]Internet.

   Because of its similarities to the tenets of [42]Discordianism, The
   Church of the SubGenius is often described as a [43]syncretic offshoot
   of that belief. However, its members state that the organization
   developed on its own with the publication of SubGenius Pamphlet #1
   (also known as The World Ends Tomorrow And You May Die!) by Reverend
   [44]Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond, the original SubGenius
   Foundation. The original group, using such pseudonyms as "Puzzling
   Evidence", "Susie the Floozie", "Palmer Vreedeez", and "Pope
   Sternodox", forwarded their literature to a number of underground
   pop-culture figures such as [45]R. Crumb, [46]Paul Mavrides, the
   [47]New Wave rock group [48]Devo, and Erik Lindgren (producer and
   president of indie label Arf! Arf! Records in Boston), who embraced it
   and incorporated it into their work. Crumb's promotion of the Church
   through his [49]comic book series Weirdo brought many new members into
   the fold, including artists, musicians, and writers. Their efforts
   resulted in the publication of the [50]Book of the SubGenius in 1983,
   followed by [51]Three-Fisted Tales of "Bob" in 1990, [52]Revelation X:
   The "Bob" Apocryphon in 1994 and [53]The SubGenius Psychlopaedia of
   Slack: The Bobliographon in 2006. The popularization of the Internet in
   the mid-1990s brought a new surge of interest in the Church, resulting
   in dozens of home-made, elaborately decorated web sites and two
   [54]Usenet [55]newsgroups, alt.slack and [56]alt.binaries.slack. (A
   third newsgroup, alt.binaries.multimedia.slack, was created on March
   12, 2005.) Ivan Stang maintains the official SubGenius home page at
   [57]http://www.subgenius.com today. The Church's weekly radio program,
   the [58]Hour of Slack, is a staple of many [59]college radio stations.

   In 1996, Rev. Stang and Steve Bevilacqua worked together to manage the
   corporate entity of the Church, the SubGenius Foundation Inc. Their
   efforts helped to bolster the Church's revival through the late 1990s
   and early 2000s, until Bevilacqua had to retire from Church management
   in order to support his wife, Rachel Bevilacqua (see [60]Legal
   matters). The first [61]X-Day gathering also took place at
   [62]Brushwood Folklore Center in [63]Sherman, NY in 1996, and the
   annual Church festival has continued there through the present day.

   Such high-profile names as [64]Paul Reubens ("Pee-wee Herman", who
   placed a picture of "Bob" in every episode of [65]Pee-wee's Playhouse),
   Magic Mose & his Royal Rockers, featuring 'Blind Sam' (who actually
   gave a free advertisement to the Church on the back of one of their
   EP's), [66]David Byrne, [67]Mark Mothersbaugh, [68]Penn Jillette,
   [69]Robert Anton Wilson, science fiction authors [70]Rudy Rucker and
   [71]John Shirley, and actor [72]Bruce Campbell have become SubGenius
   ministers.^[[73]citation needed] Composer [74]Frank Zappa says in his
   autobiography [75]The Real Frank Zappa Book that he agrees with many of
   the beliefs of the church but refrained from joining as a full member.
   Comic book author [76]Warren Ellis has stated the influence of the
   Church on his writings, though as of 2007 he has not yet admitted if he
   actually sent the $30 membership fee. [77]Patrick Volkerding, the
   founder and maintainer of [78]Slackware [79]Linux, is also a SubGenius
   affiliate, and he has confirmed the Church and "Bob" inspired the name
   for Slackware.^[80][3]

   It is claimed waggishly in church doctrine that Dobbs inspired [81]L.
   Ron Hubbard to create his own cult when he remarked to him that the
   general public may be pink, "but their money is green"^[82][4] Ivan
   Stang also claims that in 1986, an official SubGenius ordainment for
   Hubbard was paid for and mailed to his addressonly two weeks before the
   Scientology founder's death.^[83][5]

[[84]edit] Basics of "Bob"

   The Church describes its philosophy in the following manner:

   The Church Of The SubGenius is an order of Scoffers and Blasphemers,
   dedicated to Total Slack, delving into Mockery Science,
   Sadofuturistics, Megaphysics, Scatalography, Schizophreniatrics,
   Morealism, Sarcastrophy, Cynisacreligion, Apocolyptionomy,
   ESPectorationalism, Hypno-Pediatrics, Subliminalism, Satyriology,
   Disto-Utopianity, Sardonicology, Fascetiouism, Ridiculophagy, and
   Miscellatheistic Theology.

   [85]The Book of the SubGenius, page 5

   These terms, used in a manner that deliberately parodies
   [86]Scientology and [87]New Age terms, reflect the Church's appeal. It
   portrays itself as an organization for "mutants, blasphemers,
   disbelievers, rebels, outcasts, hackers, freethinkers,"^[[88]citation
   needed] and people who generally consider themselves outside the
   "mainstream" of society. The organization is widely seen as a
   [89]satire that mocks organized religion, or as the church describes
   itself, "a cynisacreligion."
   JHVH-1.
   Image St. Kenneth Huey, used with permission.

   In a manner that mocks the nature of many [90]non-profit religious
   organizations, the Church is known for blatant appeals for money from
   believers and non-believers alike. The Church is incorporated as a
   profit-making enterprise, and declares itself to be "the only religion
   that is proud to pay its taxes." Anyone can become an ordained
   SubGenius minister by paying a fee of $30 US for a lifetime membership.
   No other requirement is laid upon prospective members, though the cost
   of ordination separates the Church from the [91]Universal Life Church
   and other [92]paper churches that offer [93]ordination to all comers.
   The Church of the SubGenius is known for a standing offer that stems
   from the ordainment fee: "Eternal Salvation or TRIPLE Your Money Back!"
   The organization claims that if an ordained SubGenius minister dies and
   finds himself standing at the gates of "Normal" or "Boring" Hell, he
   will be personally greeted by Church founder [94]J. R. "Bob" Dobbs
   Himself and receive a refund check for $90.00, along with a booklet
   titled, "How to Enjoy Hell for Five Cents an Eternity," which costs
   $89.95.^[95][6]

   The Church claims that true SubGeniuses are not actually human, but
   rather are descendants of the [96]Yeti. According to Revelation X: The
   'Bob' Apocryphon (published in 1994), SubGenii are actually the
   [97]mutant offspring of a forbidden sexual union that took place
   millions of years ago between a resident of [98]Atlantis and a
   [99]human; at that time, humans were little more than a slave race. The
   resulting offspring was the catalyst that led to the fall of Atlantis.
   SubGenii often refer to one another as "Yeti" (or yetinsyny), though
   this origin story is generally not well known outside of the Church
   itself. (The term yetinsyny was appropriated from the artist
   [100]Stanisaw Szukalski, whose Behold! the Protong posited that
   Communists and other people Szukalski disliked were descendant from
   such unions.)

   The Church has said that the name "SubGenius" has nothing to do with
   [101]intelligence, of a level below [102]genius or otherwise. It
   appears to be an effort to repudiate pretentiousness. (However, in a
   purposely contradictory fashion, they have also claimed that they are
   "SubGenius" because being a [103]genius is not very
   fun.)^[[104]citation needed] The term may have something to do with the
   general unhappiness and absolute slacklessness of the self-proclaimed
   super-genius, [105]Wile E. Coyote.

[[106]edit] "Bob"

          Main article: [107]J. R. "Bob" Dobbs

   The central figurehead and symbol of the Church is the smiling,
   pipe-smoking face of [108]J. R. "Bob" Dobbs, an image based on 1950s
   styled [109]clip art, and bearing a striking resemblance to 50s comic
   strip character [110]Mark Trail. (In the SubGenius film 'Arise', "Bob"
   is described at one point, quite aptly, as "A comicbook character who
   communicates with [111]space aliens and worships money".) "Bob" was
   considered to be the best salesman of all time. The Church claims that
   "Bob" (the quotes are included when spelling his name, supposedly as a
   symbolic halo around his name) founded the Church after he saw a vision
   of [112]JHVH-1 (or "Jehovah-1") on his homemade TV.

   "Bob" was killed in San Francisco in 1984 (though former Church members
   state this was just a publicity stunt). Since that time, he has been
   killed and subsequently returned from the dead many times, though the
   Church denies any similarity between this claim and the Biblical
   account of [113]Jesus's resurrection. The Church guards the
   [114]trademark and copyright on "Bob's" image, though his face has been
   used by many artistic figures, showing up on such places as albums by
   the rock band [115]Sublime and [116]George Clinton; the movie [117]The
   Wizard of Speed and Time by [118]Mike Jittlov; in the graphical
   character set of the [119]Atari ST computers; printed on CDs for
   [120]Slackware [121]Linux (prior to Version 3); on the set of
   [122]Pee-wee's Playhouse, in British comic [123]2000AD, inside the
   strip [124]Robo-Hunter, and in [125]Devo's video for the song "Love
   Without Anger". "Bob" made an appearance in the comic [126]The Badger,
   his form having been taken by a demon who commented at one point "Do?
   I'm going to beat you to death with this pipe." He also made a brief
   appearance in [127]Marvel Comics' [128]Slapstick as a coffee store
   clerk.

   The Church has recently adopted a new symbol called the "Dobbs Icon"
   (Also known as the sacred ikon), which is a stylized cross with three
   bars and a pipe, placed in a pattern that matches the eyes, nose,
   mouth, and pipe of "Bob"'s image. This symbol resembles the
   [129]patriarchal cross as it is possibly a parody.

   Nothing is more central to "Bob" than his pipe, which is said to be
   filled with the mysterious substance known as habafropzipulops or
   "frop," (not a common drug) which may contain either mystical,
   hallucinogenic, or Divine powers. The pipe may also allude to
   [130]surrealist painter [131]Rene Magritte's famous work, [132]The
   Treachery of Images, which features an image of a pipe and the words
   "[133]Ceci n'est pas une pipe" (This is not a pipe). According to the
   church, the image of "Bob" and his pipe are often seen on random
   objects, possibly to herald things to come or as an omen, or possibly
   for no reason at all.

   The number 13,013 (usually seen as "13013") is the Number of "Bob", or
   the Mark of Dobbs.

   In its January 1, 2000 issue, a [134]Time magazine internet-based poll
   named J.R. "Bob" Dobbs the #1 "Phoney Or Fraud" of the 20th
   century.^[135][7]^[136][8]

   The central belief in the Church is the pursuit of Slack, which
   generally stands for the sense of freedom, independence, and original
   thinking that comes when you achieve your personal goals. The Church
   states that we are all born with Original Slack, but that Slack has
   been stolen from us by a worldwide [143]conspiracy of normal people, or
   "pinks". The Church encourages originality and frowns on actions seen
   as pinkness, which happens when one bows down to authority and the
   accepted limits of society. Slack is also about doing nothing and
   getting what you want anyway. "Bob" being the center of the Slack plane
   cannot fail, even his failures are startling successes as a result of
   his absurdly high Slack. Popular Church phrases supporting these goals
   are "Give Me Slack or KILL ME!", "The SubGenius Must Have Slack" and
   "Fuck 'Em If They Can't Take A Joke."

   The Linux distribution [144]Slackware is named for Slack.^[145][9] The
   card game [146]Chez Geek uses Slack to keep score; the object of the
   game is to accumulate Slack counters until one player wins by reaching
   his or her Slack Goal. One of the cards that a player can use within
   the game to gain Slack is the Book of the Subgenius.

[[147]edit] Sense of humor

   The Church encourages humor, [148]comedy, [149]parody, and [150]satire
   far more than most religious faiths. This belief is probably why the
   Church is seen on one level as an elaborate joke (the Church argues
   that if it is a joke, then it is "a very serious joke," "a joke that
   you can believe in," or "the greatest joke ever told"), an arguably
   [151]postmodern mockery of organized religion, and a parody of
   controversial religious groups and [152]cults, especially
   [153]Scientology and [154]Evangelicalism (evangelical, or
   [155]fundamentalist, [156]Protestantism, and "[157]televangelism"), to
   those unfamiliar with the church. Some refer to it as a "joke" or
   "[158]parody religion"; for instance, in their book Religion Online:
   Finding Faith on the Internet, Lorne L. Dawson and [159]Douglas E.
   Cowan characterize it as a "sophisticated joke
   [160]religion".^[161][10] Almost nothing is considered off-limits to
   comedy in SubGenius circles, and the group's jokes often veer into the
   realm of bad taste. The [162]Book of the SubGenius says: "If you don't
   laugh, you didn't get it, but if you ONLY laugh, you didn't get it."
   Church members frequently pull [163]practical jokes on each other, even
   as they are using their comedic talents to other ends.

[[164]edit] Clenches

   This section does not [165]cite any [166]references or sources.

   Church members living in the same geographic area are encouraged
   (though it is not mandatory) to form a group: a local club or "clench".
   These clenches are typically the ones who bind together in order to put
   on a Devival. Some of these clenches position themselves as their own
   religion; this is encouraged by the Church, and is officially known as
   a schism. Ivan Stang himself has been quoted as saying, "Quit the
   church and start your own damn religion!" Paradoxically, one of the
   ways one can most fully embrace the philosophy of the Church of the
   SubGenius is to ultimately declare oneself to no longer be a faithful
   member of the Church, but to instead have schismed and formed one's own
   heretical sect or denomination. This dynamic embodies the nature of the
   Church as fundamentally individualistic, and antithetical to the
   adherence and obedience-based ways of most religions.

[[170]edit] Devivals

   SubGenius gatherings, or [171]Devivals, can be seen as a combination of
   religious preaching, stand-up comedy, and [172]rock concerts. When the
   local members of the Church hold a Devival in their area, it typically
   occurs at a popular [173]nightclub, and it features SubGenius preachers
   backed by rock bands with such names as the [174]Swingin' Love Corpses,
   [175]Doktors 4 "Bob", Saint N and Hellena Handbasket, Jehovah Hates
   Phred, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, The Mondo Retardo Band, The Amino
   Acids, and the Kings of Feedback. Devivals have been held each year as
   part of both the [176]Starwood Festival and WinterStar Symposium since
   1991. Attendees at Devivals are encouraged to bring money and spend it
   at the ever-present sales table. Some Devivals have been known to veer
   out of control. In 1999, overly cautious officials of the city of
   [177]Cambridge, Massachusetts pressured owners of [178]The Middle East
   nightclub to cancel the booked devival because of a mistaken belief
   that the organizers were affiliated with the [179]Trenchcoat Mafia (an
   organization which was mistakenly accused of being responsible for the
   [180]Columbine High School massacre).^[181][11]

[[182]edit] X-Day

          Main article: [183]X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)

   An important SubGenius event occurred on July 5, 1998: [184]X-Day. The
   Church had been predicting that on this day the [185]world would be
   destroyed by invading [186]alien armies known as the X-ists (which is
   short for "Men from Planet X"). Only the members of the Church of the
   SubGenius were expected to be saved from this SubGenius version of the
   [187]apocalypse, by being carried away in the spaceships of the
   Sex-Goddesses. When the promised cataclysm failed to manifest, Rev.
   Stang was tarred and feathered by his fellow SubGenii. Nevertheless,
   Stang was permitted to retain his position as Church administrator, and
   although that day and each subsequent July 5 has passed without
   evidence of an [188]alien invasion, the faithful membership still
   gather for the "Rupture" at a [189]campground called [190]Brushwood
   Folklore Center in western New York state to herald this SubGenius
   [191]holiday. ^[192][12] Reverend [193]Ivan Stang has given many
   excuses for the failure of the Rupture to happen, such as claiming that
   "Bob" betrayed all SubGenii, that the scriptures were accidentally read
   upside down (hence the real year of the Rupture will be 8661), or that
   due to calendrical error or sabotage it is not yet really
   1998.^[194][13] Some would argue that it did happen, albeit in a
   [195]metaphysical and/or [196]allegorical manner requiring greater
   shift of [197]paradigm to truly understand. Others have suggested that
   the X-ists did visit Earth as predicted, but that the planet we know as
   Earth was either secretly switched with [198]Mars sometime during or
   shortly after [199]World War II, or that the X-ists left with the
   persuasion that mankind will do the job just as well, if not
   better.^[200][14]

   Reverend Stang has argued that X-Day is a religious holiday for the
   Church, and members of the Church should take the day of July 5 as
   vacation or holiday: "...if you can't get off the planet, at least get
   off from work."^[201][15]

[[202]edit] Other Holy Days

   Besides X-Day, the Church of the SubGenius has six seasons as
   identified in The Book (Advert, Epicacophony, Emaculation, Turnover,
   Passaround, and M'Moreal Day) and has also published a "Sacred Calendar
   of SubGenius Saints" at the end of their most recent major publication,
   [203]The SubGenius Psychlopaedia of Slack: The Bobliographon (a partial
   version of it can also be found buried in the archives of their
   website.^[204][16]) It assigns a feast day or holy day (sometimes
   several) to every day of the year. Many of these feast days are rather
   unusual:

          Lucifer)

   Additionally, in the e-mails sent out by the SubGenius foundation to
   confirm orders made at their online store, mention is made of a holiday
   called "Xistlessnessmess", which falls on December 25. Furthermore, it
   has been asserted that "Bob" has died and been reincarnated at least
   366 times throughout history & prehistory, thus every day is "Bob"'s
   birthday (and cause for celebration).

[[222]edit] Legal matters

   [223]Sister project [224]Wikinews has related news: [225]Georgia mother
   loses child custody over humorous religion

   In 2006, Rachel Bevilacqua, known as Rev. Magdalen in the SubGenius
   hierarchy, lost custody and contact with her son after a district court
   judge took offense at her participation in the Church's X-Day festival.
   Judge James Punch asked Bevilacqua to explain the humor of pictures
   from the event, and required that she produce a picture that would
   "absolutely knock my socks off with the humor of it." Without
   identifying anything in her testimony as specifically false, Punch
   pronounced her description of the church's activities as "clearly
   prevaricating" and "obviously so not true from anybody who's looking at
   it from any normal perspective" and Bevilacqua herself as "mentally
   ill" and a "pervert." (Ironically, the Official X-Day Video comes with
   a humorous instruction pamphlet that, among other things, warns people
   not to show the film to normals because "they will think you are
   insane.") Punch subsequently [226]recused himself, and Bevilacqua
   retained Lipsitz Green Scime Cambria LLP, the law firm of [227]Paul
   Cambria.^[228][17]^[229][18] On January 5, 2007, district Judge Eric
   Adams issued a ruling in Bevilacqua's favor requiring her son to be
   returned to her, but a temporary stay order was issued preventing this
   ruling from taking effect.^[230][19] The case was apparently ended on
   July 6, 2007, when a New York appellate court awarded custody of
   Bevilacqua's son to her ex-boyfriend, the boy's father.^[231][20]
   However, further incidents have resulted in an additional custody
   hearing taking place in August 2007, with Judge Punch returning to the
   case. As of August 14, 2007, custody of Bevilacqua's son has been
   awarded to her, pending the outcome of an upcoming felony hearing
   (drunk driving) for the boy's father.^[232][21]
