   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Sergeant Major Edgar Foshee, a devout [8]anti-communist, served as a
   [9]combat medic in the [10]U.S. Army Special Forces. His former wife
   [11]Thong Nguyen Cuc Foshee was held without formal charge by the
   government of Vietnam starting in September 2005. She was eventually
   convicted of terrorism and returned to the United States in November
   2006 after her early release for medical problems.

[[12]edit] Biography

   In 1974, he retired from the [13]United States Army, and later retired
   as an agent from the [14]Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He had
   served in Vietnam with both organizations, assisting the [15]South
   Vietnamese government against the Communist [16]North Vietnamese Army
   and their [17]Viet Cong agents.

   He owned a construction company until 1980, and retired with his wife
   to [18]Florida.

   On April 30, 1995, he was appointed Chairman of the International
   Committee of an exiled [19]anti-communist organization known as The
   [20]Government of Free Vietnam.
