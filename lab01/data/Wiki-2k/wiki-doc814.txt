[[19]edit] Agriculture

   Cattle farming in the county

   Cheshire is a mainly rural county with a high concentration of
   villages. Agriculture is generally based around the dairy trade and
   cattle are the predominant livestock. The number of holdings and
   hectares of agricultural land can be seen in the following table
   ^[20][1]:
                                 2002    2003    2004    2005
   Agricultural land (hectares) 148,442 153,653 158,143 155,795
   Number of holdings           5,135   4,390   4,409   4,609

   Based on holdings by EC farm type in 2005, 851 hectares were allocated
   to diary farming, with another 1,178 hectares allocated to cattle and
   sheep.

[[21]edit] Petrochemical and chemical industry

          See also: [22]Salt in Cheshire

   The chemical industry in Cheshire was founded in the [23]Roman times
   with the mining of [24]salt in Middlewich and Northwich. Salt is still
   mined in this area by [25]British Salt. The salt mining has led to a
   continued chemical industry around Northwich, with [26]Brunner Mond
   based in the town. More chemical companies, including [27]Ineos
   (formerly [28]ICI) have plants at [29]Runcorn.

   The [30]Shell [31]Stanlow Refinery is at Ellesmere Port. The oil
   refinery has operated since 1924 and has a capacity of 12 million
   tonnes per year.

[[32]edit] Transport industry

   Crewe was once the centre of the [33]British railway industry. The
   [34]Crewe railway works is a British railway engineering facility built
   in 1840 by the [35]Grand Junction Railway. At is peak the works
   employed 20000 people, though this is now less than 1000. The town's
   station remains a major railway junction.

   Crewe is also the home of [36]Bentley cars. Also within Cheshire are
   manufacturing plants for [37]Jaguar and [38]Vauxhall Motors in
   Ellesmere Port.

   The county also has an aircraft industry. The [39]BAE Systems facility
   at [40]Woodford Aerodrome was home to the production of [41]Avro
   Lancaster and [42]Avro Vulcan bombers and the [43]Hawker-Siddeley
   Nimrod. It is still part of BAE System's Military Air Solutions
   division. On the Cheshire border with [44]Flintshire, Wales is the
   [45]Broughton aircraft factory, more recently associated with
   [46]Airbus.

[[47]edit] Tourism

   Tourism in Cheshire from both within the UK and overseas continues to
   perform strongly. Over 8 million nights of accommodation (both UK &
   Overseas) and over 2.8 million visits to Cheshire were recorded during
   2003^[48][2].

[[49]edit] Trends

   At the start of 2003, there were 22,020 VAT registered enterprises in
   Cheshire, increased by 7% since 1998. Most registered businesses in
   Cheshire were in two broad sectors, namely Business Services (31.9%)
   and Wholesale/ Retail (21.7%).

   Between 2002 and 2003 the number businesses grew in four sectors:
   Public Administration and Other Services (6.0%), Hotels & Restaurants
   (5.1%), Construction (1.7%) and Business Services (1.0%)^[50][3].

   The county saw the largest proportional reduction between 2001 and 2002
   in employment in the 'Energy and Water' sector and there was also a
   significant reduction in the Manufacturing sector. The largest growth
   during this period was in the 'Other Services' and 'Distribution,
   Hotels and Retail' sector^[51][4].

   The following table is a chart of trend of regional [52]gross value
   added of the non-metropolitan county of Cheshire at 2004 basic
   prices^[53][5].
   Year Regional Gross
   Value Added Agriculture Industry Services
   1995 11,828 272 4,673 6,883
   2000 14,879 188 5,049 9,641
   2003 17,159 225 4,988 11,945

   Table notes:
     * Figures are in millions of British Pounds Sterling ()
     * Components may not sum to totals due to rounding
     * Agriculture includes hunting and forestry
     * Industry includes energy and construction
     * Services includes financial intermediation services indirectly
       measured
