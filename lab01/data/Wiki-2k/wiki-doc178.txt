[[83]edit] Publication history

   Writer-editor Stan Lee described Thor's genesis, in the context of
   having been after the creation of the [84]Hulk:
   [H]ow do you make someone stronger than the strongest person? It
   finally came to me: Don't make him human make him a god. I decided
   readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods. It
   might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends.... Besides, I
   pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old, with the flowing
   beards, horned helmets, and battle clubs.  ...Journey into Mystery,
   needed a shot in the arm, so I picked Thor ... to headline the book.
   After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had
   in mind, I asked my brother, Larry, to write the script because I
   didn't have time. ...and it was only natural for me to assign the
   penciling to Jack Kirby....^[85][1]

   Following Thor's debut in the [86]science fiction/[87]fantasy
   [88]anthology title [89]Journey into Mystery, the 13-page feature "The
   Mighty Thor" continued to be plotted by Lee but scripted by Lee's
   brother [90]Larry Lieber or [91]Robert Bernstein (working under the
   pseudonym "R. Berns"). Penciling was by either Jack Kirby, [92]Joe
   Sinnott, [93]Don Heck, or, for a single issue, [94]Al Hartley. Then
   with Journey into Mystery #101 (Feb. 1964), the series began a long and
   definitive run by Lee and Kirby that lasted until the by-then-retitled
   The Mighty Thor #179 (Aug. 1970).

   The five-page featurette "Tales of Asgard" was added in Journey into
   Mystery # 97 (Oct. 1963) followed by "The Mighty Thor" becoming the
   dominant cover logo with issue #104 (May 1964). The feature itself
   expanded to 18 pages in #105, which eliminated the remaining
   anthological story from each issue; it was reduced to 16 pages five
   issues later.

   [96]Jack Kirby and [97]Joe Sinnott.^[98][2]

   Journey into Mystery was retitled The Mighty Thor with issue #126
   (March 1966). "Tales of Asgard" was replaced by a five-page featurette
   starring the "[99]The Inhumans", from #146152 (Nov. 1967 May 1968),
   after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories reverted to
   Marvel's then-standard 20-page length.

   Once Kirby left the book, [100]John Buscema and [101]Neal Adams each
   drew a few issues. Buscema became the regular artist with issue #182
   (Nov. 1970) and continued to draw the book almost without interruption
   until #278 (Dec. 1978). Lee stopped scripting soon after Kirby left,
   and during Buscema's long stint on the book, the stories were mostly
   written by [102]Gerry Conway, [103]Len Wein, or [104]Roy Thomas. Thomas
   continued to write the book after Buscema's departure, working much of
   the time with the artist [105]Keith Pollard, but for several years The
   Mighty Thor had a changing creative team.

   [106]Walt Simonson took over both writing and art as of #337 (Nov.
   1983). Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986),
   although he continued to write and occasionally draw the book until
   issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson was responsible for introducing the
   character [107]Beta Ray Bill, in what was regarded as a popular and
   critically acclaimed run. ^[108][3]^[109][4]

   After Simonson's departure, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time,
   [110]Tom DeFalco, became the writer. Working primarily with artist
   [111]Ron Frenz, DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).

   As a consequence of the "[112]Heroes Reborn" [113]crossover event of
   the 1990s, Thor was removed from mainstream Marvel continuity and, with
   many other Marvel characters, re-imagined in an [114]alternate universe
   for one year. The Thor title reverted to [115]Journey into Mystery with
   issue #503 (Nov. 1996), and ran four different, sequential features
   ("The Lost Gods", "[116]Master of Kung Fu", "[117]Black Widow", and
   "[118]Hannibal King") before ceasing publication with #521 (June 1998).

   When Thor and the other heroes returned to the [119]Marvel Universe,
   the 85-issue Thor vol. 2 was launched, premiering with #1 (July 1998).
   This series began using dual numbering to reflect the original Thor
   series, with issue #36 / #538 (June 2001). [120]Dan Jurgens was writer
   for a majority of this series' run, leaving with issue #79 (July 2004).
   Scot G. Eaton joined him, as penciller, on #68-79. They were followed
   by co-writers Daniel Berman and [121]Michael Avon Oeming and
   penciller-inker [122]Andrea Di Vito for the "[123]Avengers
   Disassembled" crossover storyline through the final issue #85 / #587
   (Dec. 2004)

   A third volume titled Thor premiered with a first issue cover-dated
   September 2007, written by [124]J. Michael Straczynski and penciled by
   [125]Olivier Coipel. Beginning in January 2009, this volume will revert
   to issue #600 (replacing issue #13), reflecting the total number of
   Thor-centric books, between Journey into Mystery and Thor/Mighty
   Thor.^[126][5]^[127][6]

[[128]edit] Fictional character biography

   Thor's father [129]Odin decides his son needs to be taught humility and
   consequently places Thor (without memories of godhood) into the body
   and memories of an existing, partially disabled human medical student,
   Donald Blake. After becoming a doctor and thoroughly believing himself
   to be the young surgeon Blake, he later discovers Thor's disguised
   hammer and learns to change back and forth into the Thunder God. The
   real Blake's persona remains elsewhere until many years later, after
   Odin becomes satisfied of Thor's humility and lifts the spell, thereby
   removing the need for a mortal alter ego. The mortal experience,
   however, shapes Thor into an honorable and courteous individual, who is
   loyal to all comrades.

   first self-titled issue after the retitling of Journey into Mystery.

[[132]edit] Protector of Midgard

   Being the son of the [133]Elder Goddess [134]Gaea, Thor has a natural
   affinity for Earth and feels obliged to protect the mortals that occupy
   it. Thor's time on Earth is marked by battles against
   [135]supervillains, monsters, cosmic beings, and even other gods.

   Thor's principal foe is his adopted brother [136]Loki, who has hated
   Thor since childhood. Although a master of magic, Loki usually avoids
   direct confrontations for fear of angering Odin. He is discreetly
   responsible for the creation and awakening of three of Thor's principal
   foes: the [137]Absorbing Man;^[138][7] the [139]Wrecker,^[140][8] and
   the [141]Destroyer.^[142][9] On one noteworthy occasion, Loki's tactics
   are accidentally beneficial - although successful in using the
   [143]Hulk to draw Thor into battle, it results in the formation of the
   superhero team the [144]Avengers, of which Thor is a founding and
   longstanding member.^[145][10]

   Thor's mortal foes include the [146]Radioactive Man;^[147][11]
   [148]Grey Gargoyle;^[149][12] and [150]Wrecking Crew.^[151][13] Thor's
   Asgardian foes include the Storm^[152][14] and Frost Giants;^[153][15]
   the [154]Enchanters Three;^[155][16][156]Mangog;^[157][17] the
   [158]Midgard Serpent,^[159][18] the [160]Enchantress and
   [161]Executioner^[162][19] and the fire-demon [163]Surtur.^[164][20]
   Thor has also faced a number of mystical and cosmic foes, such as
   [165]Mephisto,^[166][21] [167]Thanos, ^[168][22] the [169]God
   Eater,^[170][23] the [171]Dark Gods,^[172][24] the [173]Shi'ar Praetor
   [174]Gladiator,^[175][25] and the god-slayer [176]Desak.^[177][26] Thor
   also encountered the Fourth [178]Celestial Host when it arrives to
   judge Earth.^[179][27]

[[180]edit] The Reigning

   When Thor decides to intervene in the affairs of Earth, it has major
   repercussions.^[181][28] After reluctantly assuming the throne of
   Asgard, Thor sees mortals at their worst and reshapes the world in his
   image. A nightmarish future follows as Thor and the Asgardians conquer
   Earth and slay or imprison those who oppose them, including a young
   religious mutant called Davis; [182]Zarrko the Tomorrow Man;
   [183]Perrikus of the Dark Gods; the U.S. Government, and even his
   fellow Avengers. He marries Amora (the Enchantress), and has a son,
   [184]Magni. Wracked with guilt, Thor is eventually drawn into a final
   battle with [185]Tarene and a Desak-occupied Destroyer in a [186]time
   travel bid to undo what he has done.

   When the timeline is reset, Loki revives Surtur, who forges new uru
   hammers for Loki's Storm Giant followers and begins [187]Ragnark, "the
   twilight of the gods". Thor learns that the Ragnarok cycle is the
   result of self-styled "gods to the gods" known as Those Who Sit Above
   in Shadow, who feed on the cycle. Thor confronts the [188]Norns
   (Fates), breaking the Ragnarok cycle, and then enters a stasis,
   sleeping "the sleep of the gods." With his fate unknown to the
   Avengers, he is believed to be missing in action.^[189][29]

   Thor's hammer [190]Mjolnir is found on Earth and put under U.S. Army
   protection. Sometime later, the supervillain [191]Doctor Doom is
   escaping from Hell as Mjolnir falls through that dimensional plane, and
   tries unsuccessfully to claim the hammer, which eventually comes into
   the possession of a man carrying a bag with the initials
   "D.B".^[192][30]

[[193]edit] New beginning

   Thor #54 (July 2002). Cover art by [194]Tom Raney.

   Donald Blake, upon touching the hammer Mjolnir, is transported to the
   void of non-existence in which Thor now resides. Blake explains that
   when [195]Odin originally removed the Blake persona from
   Thor,^[196][31] Blake was consigned to the void that Thor now inhabits.
   When Thor entered that void, Blake was suddenly restored to being, in
   [197]New York City. Blake convinces Thor to wield Mjolnir once more,
   return to Earth, and renew the dual identity with Blake. Blake also
   reveals that Thor's fellow Asgardians are actually not dead but hidden
   on Earth.^[198][32]

   Thor rebuilds Asgard in [199]Oklahoma, paying for the land with
   Asgardian treasure.^[200][33] He then learns of the events of the
   superhero-registration "Civil War" and is angered that Tony Stark
   ([201]Iron Man) and others used his [202]DNA to create a Thor clone.
   Stark, in response, suggests Asgard may be considered a foreign
   [203]embassy, with [204]diplomatic immunity granted to its inhabitants.
   Thor then begins searching for his fellow Asgardians,^[205][34] and
   although successfully restoring them all (with the exception of Sif who
   is trapped in an old woman's body), does not attempt to find his
   father, Odin. He eventually finds his father in [206]Valhalla, waging
   constant battle with the fire demon [207]Surtur. There Odin advises his
   son that Thor must lead the Asgardians.^[208][35]

[[209]edit] "Secret Invasion"

          Main article: [210]Secret Invasion

   In the 2008 crossover storyline "[211]Secret Invasion", Thor rescues
   and heals ally [212]Beta Ray Bill, who after being given Mjolnir, aids
   Thor in a battle against an invading force of alien
   [213]Skrulls.^[214][36] Both of them combat a genetically-bred Skrull
   called the Godkiller who is wielding Beta Ray Bill's Stormbreaker. Upon
   reclaiming Stormbreaker, Beta Ray Bill helped Thor kill the
   Godkiller.^[215][37] Thor also participates in the final battle against
   the Skrull forces, and is forced to sacrifice Avenger ally the
   [216]Wasp.^[217][38]

[[218]edit] Dark Reign

          Main article: [219]Dark Reign (comics)

   Thor's Dark Reign begins in his 600th issue, when Loki revives Bor, the
   father of Odin himself, where Loki also uses a spell to making him
   think that the world around him his evil when it's not. When Thor finds
   out there is an Asgardian destroying Manhattan, he goes there and tries
   to reason with Bor, but Bor sees him as a demon and the one that killed
   his son Odin. The two wage battle, with Thor barely holding out. He
   even decides to call forth the Avengers, but instead gets the [220]Dark
   Avengers, and they attack both of them. Thor decides to end this battle
   in one move. Both gods go head to head with one final attack, with Thor
   coming out as the victor. But then Loki and Balder appear and revealed
   to Thor who he was actually fighting. Back on Asgard, the crime for
   killing Bor is complete banishment from Asgard for eternity and Thor
   leaves. After that, Loki is seen convincing several Asgardians to move
   their kingdom to a new land, the land of Doctor Doom.^[221][39]

[[222]edit] Powers and abilities

   Like all Asgardians, Thor is not truly immortal but relies upon
   periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of [223]Idunn to sustain his
   lifespan, which to date has lasted many millennia. Being an
   Asgardian-Elder God hybrid, Thor is the strongest of the Norse gods. He
   has performed feats such as lifting a large percentage of the World
   Serpent, stated to be one third the size of the [224]Earth^[225][40],
   and hurling the Odinsword, an enormous mystical blade of incalculable
   weight, through a [226]Celestial.^[227][27] If pressed in battle, Thor
   is also capable of entering into a state known as the "[228]Warrior's
   Madness" ("brsrkargng" in Norse), which will temporarily increase his
   strength tenfold.^[229][41] He also possesses virtually inexhaustible
   godly stamina, high resistance to physical injury (eg. rocket
   fire,^[230][42] falls from orbital heights^[231][43]), immunity to all
   Earthly diseases, and superhuman agility and reflexes.

   With centuries of experience, Thor is a superb hand-to-hand combatant
   and a weapons master excelling in the use of the war hammer, sword and
   mace. Thor possesses two items that assist him in combat: the enchanted
   Belt of Strength, and his mystical hammer [232]Mjolnir. The first item
   doubles Thor's strength^[233][44] while the second is used for control
   of his weather abilities; flight,^[234][45] energy projection and
   absorption; dimensional apertures; matter manipulation and the most
   powerful of his offensives, the God Blast, and the
   Anti-Force.^[235][46]^[236][47]

   After Odin's death, Thor inherited his father's power, the Odinforce.
   Thor was then capable of feats such as reconstructing the Earth's
   Moon,^[237][48] willing the Asgardian monster [238]Mangog into
   nothingness^[239][49] and, by focusing his entire power into a hammer
   throw, decapitating a [240]Desak-occupied [241]Destroyer.^[242][50]
   Thor later acquired mastery of the Runes, and a level of enlightenment
   that allowed him to free Asgard from the eternal cycle of Ragnarok and
   become even more powerful than his father.^[243][51]

[[251]edit] Eric Masterson

          Main article: [252]Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)

   Eric Masterson is initially bonded with Thor after the Thunder God is
   punished for apparently killing Loki.^[253][53] Masterson carries the
   mantle of Thor for several years, continuing Thor's dual roles as a
   member of the Avengers and protector of Midgard. Thor is eventually
   freed,^[254][54] and in gratitude for his services, Odin provides
   Masterson with an enchanted mace, which he uses under the alias of
   [255]Thunderstrike.^[256][55]

[[257]edit] Red Norvell

   Part of a documentary crew brought to Asgard by Loki, Roger "Red"
   Norvell meets and falls in love with Lady Sif. Loki gives Norvell
   Thor's Iron Gauntlets and Belt of Strength to compete with Thor for
   Sif's affections, with neither realizing this was part of a master plan
   by Odin to create a surrogate God of Thunder to fulfill a prophecy and
   die fighting the [258]Serpent of Ragnarok.^[259][56]

[[260]edit] Ragnarok

   During a battle in the superhero "[261]Civil War" between pro- and
   anti-Superhuman Registration factions, Thor apparently appears and
   kills the superhero [262]Goliath.^[263][57] This "Thor" is later
   revealed to be a fusion of cloning technology and cybernetics created
   by scientists [264]Reed Richards and a [265]Skrull who was
   impersonating [266]Henry Pym. The ersatz Thor is destroyed by the
   anti-registration superhero [267]Hercules.^[268][58] The cyborg
   Thor-clone's remains were stored at Camp Hammond.^[269][59]

   In the 2009 crossover storyline "[270]Dark Reign", Criti Noll (the
   Skrull who posed as Henry Pym) had activated a failsafe in the cyborg
   clone of Thor, now named "Ragnarok", causing it to reactivate and
   attack Camp Hammond. After taking out [271]Baron Von Blitzschlag,
   Ragnarok defeats Thor Girl and [272]Trauma. Right when it was about to
   defeat [273]Gorilla Girl, the former [274]New Warriors members (now
   going by the name [275]Counter Force) appeared and engaged Ragnarok in
   battle.^[276][60]

   In this alternate universe, Thor and the other [279]Asgardians are
   members of a shapeshifting alien race, with forms and identities
   determined by the imagination of "Odin", a human Norse storyteller.
   ^[280][61]

[[281]edit] MC2

   In this universe, Thor is the King of Asgard, while Eric Masterson's
   son [282]Kevin is a member of [283]A-Next, a next-generation version of
   the Avengers.^[284][62]

[[285]edit] Marvel 1602

   In the [286]Marvel 1602 alternate possible past, a version of Thor
   appears with an alter ego of an elderly Christian priest named
   [287]Donal an allusion to Thor's original secret identity Donald Blake.
   Donal fears and despises his alter-ego, believing that the shared
   existence will damn him.^[288][63]

[[289]edit] 2099

   Set in a possible future year [290]2099, the role of Thor is taken by
   Cecil MacAdam, who belongs to a class of priests known as "Thorites"
   who worship the original version of Thor.^[291][64]

[[292]edit] Age of Apocalypse

   In the [293]fictional crossover event "[294]Age of Apocalypse", Donald
   Blake never discovers that he is the reincarnation of Thor, and is
   instead an agent of the Human High Council and a doctor, traveling with
   [295]Gwen Stacy to provide aid in human refugee camps.^[296][65] In a
   later edition of Marvel's [297]What-If? line, an alternate Age of
   Apocalypse saw [298]Captain America wielding Mjolnir as leader of The
   [299]Defenders, though no explaination was given of how he came to be
   in possession of the hammer, or what happened to
   Thor.^[[300]issue # needed]

[[301]edit] Dargo Ktor

   Dargo Ktor is the host of a 26th-century version of Thor, who is
   empowered when holding Mjolnir, a subject of worship in that
   century.^[302][66]

[[303]edit] Marvel Mangaverse

   A version of Thor appears briefly and aids the heroes against an
   other-world version of the villain [304]Dormammu.^[305][67]

[[306]edit] JLA/Avengers

   In the [307]2003-[308]2004 miniseries [309]JLA/Avengers, Thor is a
   member of the Avengers, and is controlled by [310]Starro at the
   beginning of the story, but is freed after the [311]Scarlet Witch
   defeats him. When the [312]JLA confronts the group in [313]Metropolis,
   Thor attacks [314]Superman, but is then attacked by both Superman and
   the [315]Martian Manhunter. Later in [316]Happy Harbor, Thor and the
   [317]Vision try to defeat [318]Red Tornado, but Thor cannot disperse
   the cyclone he creates, and is trapped by [319]Firestorm in a
   containment sphere. Thor later confronts Superman in the [320]Savage
   Land but is not able to defeat him. When the worlds are merged and the

       about a human gaining super powers, but of a [383]god realizing his
       true potential. It's the story of an [384]Old Testament god who
       becomes a [385]New Testament god".^[386][78] In December 2008,
       [387]Kenneth Branagh confirmed to [388]MTV News that he has been
