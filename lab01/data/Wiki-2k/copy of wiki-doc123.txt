   Patrick Dollan

   Glaswegian Patrick Joseph Dollan, along with his wife Agnes, was an
   activist in the Scottish [9]Independent Labour Party. During the
   [10]First World War he campaigned against the [11]Munitions of War Act
   of 1915 which suspended Trade Unionists' rights for the duration of
   hostilities. It being a common complaint of the time that whereas
   Unionists were largely prepared to temporarily forfeit their rights in
   the interests of patriotism, employers in the armaments sector seemed
   less willing to share their consequent - record - profits.

   The Dollans were vocal in raising awareness of the plight of thousands
   of Glasgow tenants who were having their rents raised at a time when
   military conscription had reduced their earning potential. Government
   concern at the volatile situation in the city led to the Rent
   Restrictions Act of November 1915, freezing rents at pre-war levels.

   In the 1920s he was the author of a booklet entitled 'The Clyde Rent
   War!;' a history of the [12]Glasgow [13]rent strikes of 1915-16 which
   also contained proposals for housing policy reform.

   In 1939 he won the inaugural St Mungo Prize, awarded since triannually
   to the person deemed to have done the most to promote and improve the
   city of [14]Glasgow in the previous three years. He served as [15]Lord
   Provost of Glasgow 1938-1941 and was later knighted.

   The [16]Dollan Baths in [17]East Kilbride, Scotland's first
   Olympic-sized swimming pool, is named in his honour.
