   Valentine McGillycuddy, on march with General Crook's expedition to the
   Black Hills

   Dr. Valentine Trant McGillycuddy (18491939) was a controversial pioneer
   of the effort to build a sustainable relationship between the
   [14]United States and the [15]Native American people. As the surveyor
   for the [16]Newton-Jenney Party, McGillycuddy was the first known
   person to climb [17]Harney Peak in the [18]Black Hills of [19]South
   Dakota. He then served as Contract Surgeon with General [20]George
   Crook during the [21]Battle of the Rosebud, the [22]Battle of Slim
   Buttes, and the [23]Horsemeat March.

   As Assistant Post Surgeon at [24]Fort Robinson and later as [25]Indian
   Agent for the [26]Red Cloud Agency, McGillycuddy was known to the
   [27]Lakota of the modern-day [28]Pine Ridge Indian Reservation as
   "Friend of [29]Crazy Horse", and was the doctor who treated Crazy Horse
   at the time of his death.

   While he may have been a friend to Crazy Horse, he was not so much
   loved by some other Lakotas, including [30]Red Cloud, a major [31]Sioux
   chief. Red Cloud's accusations of mismanagement led to several
   investigations of Dr. McGillycuddy's administration. Under pressure to
   arbitrarily fire a loyal clerk, Dr. McGillycuddy eventually resigned
   his post. Later, in the days leading up to the [32]Wounded Knee
   Massacre, [33]Red Cloud conceded that McGillycuddy had been a "young
   man with an old man's head on his shoulders."

   Dr. McGillycuddy would later serve as mayor of [34]Rapid City, Dean of
   the [35]South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, delegate to the
   South Dakota State Constitutional Convention, and as South Dakota's
   first State [36]Surgeon General. The mansion that he built in 1888 is
   still standing today in Rapid City.

   McGillycuddy died at age 90 in [37]Berkeley, [38]California. His
   [39]ashes are entombed at the top of [40]Harney Peak behind a
   [41]plaque that reads "Valentine McGillycuddy, Wasitu Wacan."
