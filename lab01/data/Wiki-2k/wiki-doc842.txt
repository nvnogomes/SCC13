[[29]edit] Career

   McCallion stands in as captain of Derry City in the absence of
   [30]Peter Hutton.

[[31]edit] Blackburn Rovers

   Having played with local [32]Derry and District League club, [33]Foyle
   Harps Y.F.C., as a youth from 1995, McCallion was spotted by
   [34]Blackburn Rovers in 1997 and moved to the English club that same
   year. Spending just a year at [35]Ewood Park, he never managed to break
   into the first-team whilst there.

[[36]edit] Derry City

   McCallion signed for his home town club from [37]Blackburn Rovers in
   1998 and made his debut away to [38]Cork City on [39]6 September, 1998.
   He is the first choice right-back and has also performed at centre-back
   when required.

   Dropped from the side for Damian Brennan at the start of the 2005
   season, he fought his way back into the team and by the end of the
   season he was the first choice right-back, helping his club to a second
   place finish in the league. He scored an important goal against
   [40]Kildare County in the [41]FAI Cup that same season and his
   overlapping runs offered [42]Derry City F.C. another attacking option.

   McCallion often deputises in the role of captain if [43]Peter Hutton is
   absent. McCallion had captained the side on 13 occasions by the end of
   the 2006 season - one of the most notable of these being Derry City's
   [44]UEFA Cup First Round 0-0 draw against [45]Paris Saint-Germain at
   the [46]Brandywell Stadium on [47]14 September, 2006.

   McCallion made 52 appearances in all competitions during the 2006
   season, the most of any City player that season, and, once again,
   helped the club finish as runners-up in the league for a second season
   running, consolidating his position as a firm fan-favourite.

   The defender is one of the few brothers to have played in a winning
   [48]FAI Cup side, as he appeared with brother [49]Tommy in the 2002
   final team.

   [50]Fabrice Pancrate - during a 2006 [51]UEFA Cup game against
   [52]Paris Saint-Germain at the [53]Brandywell.
