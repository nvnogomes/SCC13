   The coat of arms of the Earls of Carnarvon.

   Earl of Carnarvon is a title that has been created three times in
   British history. The first creation came in the [9]Peerage of England
   in 1628 in favour of [10]Robert Dormer, 2nd Baron Dormer. For more
   information on this creation, which became extinct in 1709, see the
   [11]Baron Dormer. The title was created again in 1714 in the
   [12]Peerage of Great Britain for [13]James Brydges, 9th Baron Chandos.
   In 1719 he was further honoured when he was made Marquess of Carnarvon
   and Duke of Chandos. For more information on this creation, which
   became extinct in 1789, see the [14]Duke of Chandos.

   The title was created for a third time in the [15]Peerage of Great
   Britain in 1793 for [16]Henry Herbert, 1st Baron Porchester. The
   precise form of this creation was Earl of the Town and County of
   Carnarvon, in the [17]Principality of Wales (although in practice only
   the style of "Earl of Carnarvon" is used). He had previously
   represented [18]Wilton in the [19]House of Commons and had already in
   1780 been created Baron Porchester, of High Clere in the County of
   Southampton (also in the Peerage of Great Britain). Herbert was the son
   of Major-General the Hon. William Herbert, fifth son of [20]Thomas
   Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the
   second Earl. He sat as [21]Whig [22]Member of Parliament for
   [23]Cricklade.

   His eldest son, the third Earl, briefly represented [24]Wootton Bassett
   in Parliament as a [25]Tory before he succeeded his father in the
   earldom. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, was a prominent
   [26]Conservative politician and served as [27]Secretary of State for
   the Colonies and as [28]Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was succeeded by
   his only son from his first marriage, the fifth Earl. He is famous for
   discovering the tomb of [29]Tutankhamun along with [30]Howard Carter.
   As of 2007 the titles are held by his great-grandson, the eighth Earl,
   who succeeded in 2001. As a descendant of the eighth Earl of Pembroke
   he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles.

   Several other members of this branch of the Herbert family may be
   mentioned. The Very Reverend the Hon. [31]William Herbert, third son of
   the first Earl, was a clergyman and noted botanist. His son [32]Henry
   William Herbert was a novelist and writer on sport. Sir Robert George
   Wyndham Herbert, [33]Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the
   Colonies from 1871 to 1892, was the son of the Hon. Algernon Herbert,
   fifth son of the first Earl. The Hon. [34]Auberon Herbert, second son
   of the third Earl, was a writer, theorist, philosopher and also
   represented [35]Nottingham in the House of Commons. He married Lady
   Florence Amabel Cowper, daughter of George Augustus Frederick Cowper,
   6th Earl Cowper and his wife Anne Florence Cowper, 7th Baroness Lucas
   of Crudwell. In 1905 their only son [36]Auberon Herbert succeeded his
   uncle as ninth [37]Baron Lucas of Crudwell (see this title for further
   history of this branch of the family). The Hon. [38]Aubrey Herbert,
   second son of the fourth Earl, was Member of Parliament for [39]South
   Somerset and for [40]Yeovil. His son [41]Auberon Herbert was an expert
   on Eastern Europe.

   The town and [42]county in [43]Wales to which the title refers are now
   usually spelt [44]Caernarfon.

   The family seat is [45]Highclere Castle in [46]Hampshire.
