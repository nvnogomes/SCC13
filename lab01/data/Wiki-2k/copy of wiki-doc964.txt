   Edward Wright ([29]baptised 8 October 1561; died November 1615) was an
   [30]English [31]mathematician and [32]cartographer noted for his book
   Certaine Errors in Navigation (1599; 2nd ed., 1610), which for the
   first time explained the mathematical basis of the [33]Mercator
   projection, and set out a reference table giving the linear scale
   multiplication factor as a function of [34]latitude, calculated for
   each [35]minute of arc up to a latitude of 75. This was the essential
   step needed to make practical both the making and the navigational use
   of Mercator charts.

   Wright was educated at the [36]University of Cambridge, and was
   subsequently a [37]fellow of [38]Gonville and Caius College between
   1587 and 1596. In 1589 the College granted him leave after
   [39]Elizabeth I requested that he carry out [40]navigational studies
   with a raiding expedition organised by the [41]Earl of Cumberland to
   the [42]Azores to capture Spanish [43]galleons. The expedition's route
   was the subject of the first map to be prepared according to Wright's
   projection, which was published in Certaine Errors in 1599. The same
   year, Wright created and published the first world map produced in
   England and the first to use the Mercator projection since [44]Gerardus
   Mercator's original 1569 map.

   In the early 1600s Wright was appointed as [45]surveyor to the [46]New
   River project, which successfully directed the course of a new man-made
   channel to bring clean water from [47]Ware, [48]Hertfordshire, to
   [49]Islington, London. Around this time, Wright also lectured
   mathematics to [50]merchant seamen, and from 1608 or 1609 was
   mathematics tutor to the son of [51]James I, the [52]heir apparent
   [53]Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, until the latter's untimely death
   at the age of 18 in 1612. A skilled designer of mathematical
   instruments, Wright made models of an [54]astrolabe and a
   [55]pantograph, and a type of [56]armillary sphere for Prince Henry. In
   the 1610 edition of Certaine Errors he described inventions such as the
   "sea-ring" that enabled mariners to determine the [57]magnetic
   variation of the [58]compass, the sun's altitude and the time of day in
   any place if the latitude was known; and a device for finding latitude
   when one was not on the [59]meridian using the height of the [60]pole
   star.

   Apart from a number of other books and pamphlets, Wright translated
   [61]John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of
   [62]logarithms from [63]Latin into English. This was published after
   Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes
   (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer
   and mathematician [64]Willebrord Snellius; [65]Adriaan Metius, the
   geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician
   [66]Richard Norwood, who calculated the length of a [67]degree on a
   [68]great circle of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.

[[83]edit] Family and education

   The younger son of Henry and Margaret Wright, Edward Wright was born in
   the village of Garveston in [84]Norfolk,^[85][1] [86]East Anglia, and
   was [87]baptised there on 8 October 1561. It is possible that he
   followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Thomas (died 1579) and
   went to school in [88]Hardingham.^[89][2] The family was of modest
   means,^[90][3] and he [91]matriculated at [92]Gonville and Caius
   College, [93]University of Cambridge, on 8 December 1576^[94][2] as a
   [95]sizar.^[96][4] Sizars were students of limited means who were
   charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other
   assistance during their period of study, often in exchange for
   performing work at their colleges.

   Wright was conferred a [97]Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 15801581. He
   remained a scholar at Caius, receiving his [98]Master of Arts (M.A.)
   there in 1584, and holding a [99]fellowship between 1587 and
   1596.^[100][5] At Cambridge, he was a close friend of [101]Robert
   Devereux, later the Second [102]Earl of Essex, and met him to discuss
   his studies even in the weeks before Devereux's rebellion against
   [103]Elizabeth I in 16001601. In addition, he came to know the
   mathematician [104]Henry Briggs; and the soldier and [105]astrologer
   [106]Christopher Heydon, who was also Devereux's
   friend.^[107][4]^[108][2] Heydon later made astronomical observations
   with instruments Wright made for him.^[109][6]

[[110]edit] Foreign expedition

   [111]Hilliard's portrait of [112]George, Earl of Cumberland (c. 1590,
   detail). Wright dedicated his work Certaine Errors in Navigation (1599)
   to him.

   In 1589, two years after being appointed to his fellowship, Wright was
   requested by Elizabeth I to carry out [113]navigational studies with a
   raiding expedition organised by the [114]Earl of Cumberland to the
   [115]Azores to capture Spanish [116]galleons. The Queen effectively
   ordered Caius to grant him leave of absence for this purpose, although
   the College expressed this more diplomatically by granting him a
   [117]sabbatical "by Royal mandate".^[118][7] Wright participated in the
   confiscation of "lawful" [119]prizes from the French, Portuguese and
   Spanish Derek Ingram, a life fellow of Caius, has called him "the only
   Fellow of Caius ever to be granted sabbatical leave in order to engage
   in piracy".^[120][7] Wright sailed with Cumberland in the Victory from
   [121]Plymouth on 8 June 1589; they returned to [122]Falmouth on 27
   December of the same year.^[123][2] An account of the expedition is
   appended to Wright's work Certaine Errors of Navigation (1599), and
   while it refers to Wright in the third person it is believed to have
   been written by him.^[124][4]

   In Wright's account of the Azores expedition, he listed as one of the
   expedition's members a "Captaine Edwarde Carelesse, alias Wright, who
   in S. Frauncis Drakes West-Indian voiage was Captaine of the Hope". In
   another work, The Haven-finding Art (1599) (see [125]below), Wright
   stated that "the time of my first employment at sea" was "now more than
   tenne yeares since".^[126][2] The [127]Oxford Dictionary of National
   Biography asserts that during the expedition Wright called himself
   "Captain Edward Carelesse", and that he was also the [128]captain of
   the Hope in Sir [129]Francis Drake's voyage of 15851586 to the
   [130]West Indies, which evacuated Sir [131]Walter Raleigh's [132]Colony
   of Virginia. One of the colonists was the mathematician [133]Thomas
   Harriot, and if the Dictionary is correct it is probable that on the
   return journey to England Wright and Harriot became acquainted and
   discussed navigational mathematics.^[134][4] However, in a 1939
   article, E.J.S. Parsons and W.F. Morris note that in Capt. Walter
   Bigges and Lt. Crofts' book A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir
   Frances Drakes West Indian Voyage (1589),^[135][8] Edward Careless was
   referred to as the commander of the Hope, but Wright was not mentioned.
   Further, while Wright spoke several times of his participation in the
   Azores expedition, he never alluded to any other voyage. Although the
   reference to his "first employment" in The Haven-finding Art suggests
   an earlier venture, there is no evidence that he went to the West
   Indies. Gonville and Caius College holds no records showing that Wright
   was granted leave before 1589.^[136][2]

   There is nothing to suggest that Wright ever went to sea again after
   his expedition with the Earl of Cumberland.^[137][4]

[[138]edit] Mathematician and cartographer

[[139]edit] Navigation and cartography

   Wright resumed his Cambridge fellowship upon returning from the Azores
   in 1589,^[140][3] but it appears that he soon moved to London for he
   was there with Christopher Heydon making observations of the sun
   between 1594 and 1597, and on 8 August 1595 Wright married Ursula
   Warren (died 1625) at the [141]parish church of [142]St. Michael,
   Cornhill, in the [143]City of London.^[144][9] They had a son, Samuel
   (15961616), who was himself admitted as a sizar^[145][4] at Caius on 7
   July 1612.^[146][10] The St. Michael parish register also contains
   references to other children of Wright, all of whom died before
   1617.^[147][10] Wright resigned his fellowship in 1596.^[148][4]
   Wright explained the [149]Mercator projection with the analogy of a
   sphere being inflated like a [150]bladder inside a hollow
   [151]cylinder.^[152][11] The sphere is expanded uniformly, so that the
   [153]meridians lengthen in the same proportion as the [154]parallels,
   until each point of the expanding spherical surface comes into contact
   with the inside of the cylinder. This process [155]preserves the local
   shape and angles of features on the surface of the original globe, at
   the expense of parts of the globe with different latitudes becoming
   expanded by different amounts.^[156][12] The cylinder is then opened
   out into a two-dimensional [157]rectangle. The projection is a boon to
   navigators as [158]rhumb lines are depicted as straight lines.

   Wright helped the mathematician and globe maker [159]Emery Molyneux to
   plot coastlines on his terrestrial globe, and translated some of the
   legends into [160]Latin.^[161][13] Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial
   globes, the first to be manufactured in England, were published in late
   1592 or early 1593, and Wright explained their use in his 1599 work
   Certaine Errors in Navigation. He dedicated the book to Cumberland, to
   whom he had presented a manuscript of the work in
   1592,^[162][14]^[163][15] stating in the preface it was through
   Cumberland that he "was first moved, and received maintenance to divert
   my mathematical studies, from a theoricall speculation in the
   Universitie, to the practical demonstration of the use of
   Navigation".^[164][16]

   The most significant aspect of the book was Wright's method for
   dividing the [165]meridian, an explanation of how he had constructed a
   table for the division, and the uses of this information for
   navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to
   accurately depict a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the
   projection used by [166]Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569.
   Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it
   represented lines of constant [167]true bearing or [168]true course,
   known as loxodromes or [169]rhumb lines, as straight lines. However,
   Mercator had not explained his method.^[170][17]

   On a globe, [171]circles of latitude (also known as parallels) get
   smaller as they move away from the [172]Equator towards the [173]North
   or [174]South Pole. Thus, in the Mercator projection, when a globe is
   "unwrapped" on to a rectangular map, the parallels need to be stretched
   to the length of the Equator. In addition, parallels are further apart
   as they approach the [175]poles. Wright compiled a table with three
   columns. The first two columns contained the [176]degrees and
   [177]minutes of [178]latitudes for parallels spaced 10 minutes apart on
   a sphere, while the third column had the parallel's projected distance
   from the Equator. Any cartographer or navigator could therefore lay out
   a Mercator grid for himself by consulting the table.^[179][18] Wright
   explained:

   I first thought of correcting so many gross errors ... in the sea
   chart, by increasing the distances of the parallels, from the
   [180]equinoctial towards the poles, in such sort, that at every point
   of latitude in the chart, a part of the meridian might have the same
   proportion to the like part of the parallel, that it has in the
   globe.^[181][19]

   [182]Hondius made use of Wright's calculations without acknowledgment
   in his "Christian Knight Map" of 1597, prompting Wright to publish
   Certaine Errors in Navigation in 1599.

   While the first edition of Certaine Errors contained an abridged table
   six pages in length, in the second edition which appeared in 1610
   Wright published a full table across 23 pages with figures for
   parallels at one-minute intervals. The table is remarkably accurate
   American geography professor [183]Mark Monmonier wrote a computer
   program to replicate Wright's calculations, and determined that for a
   Mercator map of the world 3 feet (0.91 m) wide, the greatest
   discrepancy between Wright's table and the program was only
   0.00039 inches (0.0099 mm) on the map.^[184][20] In the second edition
   Wright also incorporated various improvements, including proposals for
   determining the magnitude of the Earth and reckoning common linear
   measurements as a proportion of a degree on the Earth's surface "that
   they might not depend on the uncertain length of a barley-corn"; a
   correction of [185]errors arising from the eccentricity of the eye when
   making observations using the [186]cross-staff; amendments in tables of
   [187]declinations and the positions of the sun and the stars, which
   were based on observations he had made together with Christopher Heydon
   using a 6-foot (1.8 m) [188]quadrant; and a large table of the
   [189]variation of the compass as observed in different parts of the
   world, to show that it is not caused by any [190]magnetic pole. He also
   incorporated a translation of Rodrigo Zamorano's Compendio de la Arte
   de Navegar (Compendium of the Art of Navigation, Seville, 1581; 2nd
   ed., 1588).^[191][21]
   Edward Wright's map "for sailing to the Isles of [192]Azores" (c.
   1595), the first to be prepared according to his projection
   Wright's "Chart of the World on Mercator's Projection" (c. 1599),
   otherwise known as the WrightMolyneux map

   Wright was prompted to publish the book after two incidents of his
   text, which had been prepared some years earlier, being used without
   attribution. He had allowed his table of meridional parts to be
   published by [193]Thomas Blundeville in his Exercises (1594)^[194][22]
   and in Sir William Barlow's The Navigator's Supply (1597),^[195][23]
   although only Blundeville acknowledged Wright by name. However, an
   experienced navigator, believed to be Abraham Kendall, borrowed a draft
   of Wright's manuscript and, unknown to him, made a copy of it which he
   took on Sir [196]Francis Drake's 1595 expedition to the West Indies. In
   1596 Kendall died at sea. The copy of Wright's work in his possession
   was brought back to London and wrongly believed to be by Kendall, until
   the Earl of Cumberland passed it to Wright and he recognised it as his
   work.^[197][24] Also around this time, the Dutch cartographer
   [198]Jodocus Hondius borrowed Wright's draft manuscript for a short
   time after promising not to publish its contents without his
   permission. However, Hondius then employed Wright's calculations
   without acknowledging him for several regional maps and in his world
   map published in Amsterdam in 1597. This map is often referred to as
   the "Christian Knight Map" for its engraving of a Christian knight
   battling sin, the flesh and the Devil. Although Hondius sent Wright a
   letter containing a faint apology, Wright condemned Hondius's deceit
   and greed in the preface to Certaine Errors.^[199][25] He wryly
   commented: "But the way how this [Mercator projection] should be done,
   I learned neither of Mercator, nor of any man els. And in that point I
   wish I had beene as wise as he in keeping it more charily to
   myself".^[200][26]

   The first map to be prepared according to Wright's projection was
   published in his book, and showed the route of Cumberland's expedition
   to the Azores. A manuscript version of this map is preserved at
   [201]Hatfield House; it is believed to have been drawn in about
   1595.^[202][27] Following this, Wright created a new world map, the
   first map of the globe to be produced in England and the first to use
   the [203]Mercator projection since Gerardus Mercator's 1569 original.
   Based on Molyneux's terrestrial globe, it corrected a number of errors
   in the earlier work by Mercator. The map, often called the
   WrightMolyneux Map, first appeared in the second volume of [204]Richard
   Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and
   Discoueries of the English Nation (1599).^[205][28] Unlike many
   contemporary maps and charts which contained fantastic speculations
   about unexplored lands, Wright's map has a minimum of detail and blank
   areas wherever information was lacking. The map was one of the earliest
   to use the name "[206]Virginia".^[207][29] [208]Shakespeare alluded to
   the map in [209]Twelfth Night (16001601),^[210][30] when Maria says of
   [211]Malvolio: "He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the
   new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies."^[212][31] Another
   world map, larger and with updated details, appeared in the second
   edition of Certaine Errors (1610).^[213][31]

   Wright translated into English De Havenvinding (1599) by the
   [214]Flemish mathematician and engineer [215]Simon Stevin, which
   appeared in the same year as The Haven-Finding Art, or the Way to Find
   any Haven or Place at Sea, by the Latitude and Variation. He also wrote
   the preface to physician and scientist [216]William Gilbert's great
   work [217]De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete
   Tellure (The Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet the Earth,
   1600),^[218][32] in which Gilbert described his experiments which led
   to the conclusion that the [219]Earth was magnetic, and introduced the
   term electricus to describe the phenomenon of [220]static electricity
   produced by rubbing [221]amber (called lectrum in [222]Classical Latin,
   derived from (elektron) in [223]Ancient Greek).^[224][33] According to
   the mathematician and physician [225]Mark Ridley,^[226][34] chapter 12
   of book 4 of De Magnete, which explained how [227]astronomical
   observations could be used to determine the [228]magnetic variation,
   was actually Wright's work.^[229][4]

   Gilbert had invented a [230]dip-compass and compiled a table recording
   the [231]dip of the needle below the horizon. Wright believed that this
   device would prove to be extremely useful in determining latitude and,
   with the help of Blundeville and Briggs, wrote a small pamphlet called
   The Making, Description and Use of the Two Instruments for Sea-men to
   find out the Latitude ... First Invented by Dr. Gilbert. It was
   published in 1602 in Blundeville's book The Theoriques of the Seuen
   Planets.^[232][35] That same year he authored The Description and Use
   of the Sphre (not published till 1613), and in 1605 published a new
   edition of the widely used work The Safegarde of
   Saylers.^[233][36]^[234][37]

[[235]edit] Surveying

   The New River at [236]Enfield Town Park in London photographed on 3
   February 2008

   Wright also developed a reputation as a [237]surveyor on land. He
   prepared "a [238]plat of part of the waye whereby a newe River may be
   brought from [239]Uxbridge to [240]St. James, [241]Whitehall,
   [242]Westminster[,] the [243]Strand, [244]St. Giles, [245]Holbourne and
   London",^[246][38] However, according to a 1615 paper in Latin in the
   annals of Gonville and Caius College, he was prevented from bringing
   this plan to fruition "by the tricks of others".^[247][21]^[248][39]
   Nonetheless, in the early 1600s he was appointed by Sir [249]Hugh
   Myddelton as surveyor to the [250]New River project, which successfully
   directed the course of a new man-made channel to bring clean water from
   Chadwell Spring at [251]Ware, [252]Hertfordshire,^[253][21] to
   [254]Islington, London. Although the distance in a straight line from
   Ware to London is only slightly more than 20 miles (32 km), the project
   required a high degree of surveying skill on Wright's part as it was
   necessary for the river to take a route of over 40 miles following the
   100-foot (30 m) [255]contour line on the west side of the [256]Lee
   Valley. As the technology of the time did not extend to large pumps or
   pipes, the water flow had to depend on gravity through canals or
   [257]aqueducts over an average fall of 5.5 inches a mile (approximately
   8.7 centimetres per kilometre).^[258][7]^[259][40]

   Work on the New River started in 1608 the date of a monument at
   Chadwell Spring but halted near [260]Wormley, [261]Surrey, in 1610. The
   stoppage has been attributed to factors such as Myddelton facing
   difficulties in raising funds, and landowners along the route opposing
   the acquisition of their lands on the ground that the river would turn
   their meadows into "bogs and quagmires".^[262][40] Although the
   landowners petitioned [263]Parliament they did not succeed in having
   the legislation authorizing the project repealed prior to Parliament
   being dissolved in 1611; the work resumed later that year. The New
   River was officially opened on 29 September 1613 by the [264]Lord Mayor
   of London, Sir John Swinnerton, at the Round Pond, New River Head, in
   Islington. It still supplies the capital with water today.^[265][40]

[[266]edit] Other mathematical work

   For some time Wright had urged that a navigation lectureship be
   instituted for [267]merchant seamen, and he persuaded Admiral Sir
   [268]William Monson, who had been on Cumberland's Azores expedition of
   1589, to encourage a [269]stipend to be paid for this. At the beginning
   of the 17th century, Wright succeeded [270]Thomas Hood as a mathematics
   lecturer under the patronage of the wealthy merchants [271]Sir Thomas
   Smyth and [272]Sir John Wolstenholme; the lectures were held in Smyth's
   house in Philpot Lane.^[273][41] By 1612 or 1614 the [274]East India
   Company had taken on sponsorship of these lectures for an annual fee of
   50^[275][15]^[276][39] (about 6,500 as of 2007).^[277][42] Wright was
   also mathematics tutor to the son of [278]James I, the [279]heir
   apparent [280]Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, from 1608 or
   1609^[281][15]^[282][37] until the latter's untimely death at the age
   of 18 on 6 November 1612. Wright was described as "a very poor man" in
   the Prince's will and left the sum of 30 8[283]s (about 4,300 in
   2007).^[284][4] To the Prince, who was greatly interested in the
   science of navigation,^[285][43] Wright dedicated the second edition of
   Certaine Errors (1610) and the world map published therein. He also
   drew various maps for him, including a "sea chart of the [286]N.-W.
   Passage; a paradoxall sea-chart of the World from 30 Latitude
   northwards; [and] a [287]plat of the drowned groundes about [288]Elye,
   [289]Lincolnshire, [290]Cambridgeshire, &c".^[291][37]

   Wright was a skilled designer of mathematical instruments. According to
   the 1615 Caius annals, "[h]e was excellent both in contrivance and
   execution, nor was he inferior to the most ingenious mechanic in the
   making of instruments, either of brass or any other matter".^[292][21]
   For Prince Henry, he made models of an [293]astrolabe and a
   [294]pantograph,^[295][39] and created or arranged to be created out of
   wood a form of [296]armillary sphere which replicated the motions of
   the [297]celestial sphere, the circular motions of the sun and moon,
   and the places and possibilities of them [298]eclipsing each other. The
   sphere was designed for a motion of 17,100 years, if the machine should
   last that long.^[299][21] In 1613 Wright published The Description and
   Use of the Sphre, which described the use of this device.^[300][4] The
   sphere was lost during the [301]English Civil War, but found in 1646 in
   the [302]Tower of London by the mathematician and surveyor Sir
   [303]Jonas Moore, who was later appointed Surveyor General of the
   [304]Ordnance Office and became a patron and the principal driving
   force behind the establishment of the [305]Royal Observatory at
   Greenwich. Moore asked the King to let him have it, restored the
   instrument at his own expense and deposited it at his own house "in the
   Tower".^[306][21]^[307][44]

   The Caius annals also report that Wright "had formed many other useful
   designs, but was hindered by death from bringing them to
   perfection".^[308][21] The 1610 edition of Certaine Errors contained
   descriptions of the "sea-ring", which consisted of a [309]universal
   ring dial mounted over a magnetic [310]compass that enabled mariners to
   readily determine the magnetic variation of the compass, the sun's
   altitude and the time of day in any place if the latitude was
   known;^[311][45] the "sea-quadrant", for the taking of altitudes by a
   forward or backward observation; and a device for finding latitude when
   one was not on the meridian using the height of the [312]pole
   star.^[313][21]
   The Scotsman [314]John Napier (15501617), the inventor of
   [315]logarithms, depicted in an engraving by Samuel Freeman (17731857)
   based on a 1616 painting at the [316]University of Edinburgh

   In 1614 Wright published a small book called A Short Treatise of
   Dialling Shewing, the Making of All Sorts of Sun-dials, but he was
   mainly preoccupied with [317]John Napier's Mirifici Logarithmorum
   Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Rule of
   Logarithms),^[318][46] which introduced the idea of [319]logarithms.
   Wright at once saw the value of logarithms as an aid to navigation, and
   lost no time in preparing a translation which he submitted to Napier
   himself. The preface to Wright's edition consists of a translation of
   the preface to the Descriptio, together with the addition of the
   following sentences written by Napier himself:

   But now some of our countreymen in this Island well affected to these
   studies, and the more publique good, procured a most learned
   Mathematician to translate the same into our vulgar English tongue, who
   after he had finished it, sent the Coppy of it to me, to bee seene and
   considered on by myselfe. I having most willingly and gladly done the
   same, finde it to bee most exact and precisely conformable to my minde
   and the originall. Therefore it may please you who are inclined to
   these studies, to receive it from me and the Translator, with as much
   good will as we recommend it unto you.^[320][47]

   While working on the translation, Wright died in late November 1615 and
   was buried on 2 December 1615 at [321]St. Dionis Backchurch in the City
   of London.^[322][48] The Caius annals noted that although he "was rich
   in fame, and in the promises of the great, yet he died poor, to the
   scandal of an ungrateful age".^[323][21] Wright's translation of
   Napier, which incorporated tables that Wright had supplemented and
   further information by Henry Briggs, was completed by Wright's son
   Samuel and arranged to be printed by Briggs.^[324][4] It appeared
   posthumously as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes in
   1616, and in it Wright was lauded in verse as "[t]hat famous, learned,
   Errors true Corrector, / England's great Pilot, Mariners
   Director".^[325][49]

   According to Parsons and Morris, the use of Wright's publications by
   later mathematicians is the "greatest tribute to his life's
   work".^[326][39] Wright's work was relied on by Dutch astronomer and
   mathematician [327]Willebrord Snellius, noted for the law of
   [328]refraction now known as [329]Snell's law, for his navigation
   treatise Tiphys Batavus (Batavian Tiphys, 1624);^[330][50] and by
   [331]Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland, for
   [332]Primum Mobile (1631).^[333][51] Following Wright's proposals,
   [334]Richard Norwood measured a degree on a [335]great circle of the
   earth at 367,196 feet (111,921 m), publishing the information in
   1637.^[336][52] Wright was praised by Charles Saltonstall in The
   Navigator (1642)^[337][53] and by [338]John Collins in Navigation by
   the Mariners Plain Scale New Plain'd (1659),^[339][54] Collins stating
   that Mercator's chart ought "more properly to be called Wright's
   chart".^[340][39] The Caius annals contained the following epitaph: "Of
   him it may truly be said, that he studied more to serve the public than
   himself".^[341][21]
