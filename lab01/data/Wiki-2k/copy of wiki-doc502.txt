   Duncannon ([28]Irish: Dn Canann, meaning the Fort of Conn, possibly
   [29]Conn mac Morna of the [30]Fianna) is a village in southwest
   [31]County Wexford, [32]Ireland. Bordered to the west by Waterford
   harbour and sitting on a rocky promontory jutting into the channel is
   the strategically prominent Duncannon Fort which dominates the village.

   Primarily a [33]fishing village, Duncannon also relies heavily on
   tourism and is situated on the clearly signposted and very scenic Ring
   of [34]Hook drive. Duncannon boasts a mile long, [35]blue flag
   recipient golden beach and is a very popular spot with locals and
   tourists alike.^[[36]citation needed]

   Duncannon Fort, which was built in [37]1588 incorporates a maritime
   museum, Arts centre, caf and craft shop and is open daily to visitors
   from June to September. Guided tours are available. Cinema buffs might
   be interested to know that Duncannon and Fort was the recent location
   for the opening scenes of the remake of '[38]The Count of Monte
   Cristo', starring [39]Jim Caviezel and [40]Richard
   Harris.^[[41]citation needed]

[[47]edit] History

   According to legend, the settlement at Duncannon dates back to the time
   of [48]Fionn mac Cumhaill (pop: Finn McCool) and the [49]Fianna in the
   3rd century AD.^[[50]citation needed]

   Duncannon was of vital strategic importance as its fort commanded the
   bay giving sea access to [51]Waterford Harbour. As a result it was
   centrally involved in wars and sieges during the 17th and 18th
   centuries.

   During the [52]Irish Confederate Wars ([53]1641-[54]1652), the fort at
   Duncannon was initially occupied by English soldiers and used as a base
   for an attack on nearby Redmond's Hall (now [55]Loftus Hall). During
   this period it was besieged three times. In [56]1645 it was taken by an
   Irish Confederate army under general [57]Thomas Preston. Its English
   garrison surrendered after lengthy bombardment, during which their
   commander was killed and a ship trying to bring supplies to the
   garrison was sunk (see [58]Siege of Duncannon). During the
   [59]Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Duncannon was besieged
   again,^[60][1] as part of the [61]Siege of Waterford, firstly in
   November 1649 by [62]Oliver Cromwell and [63]Michael Jones in [64]1649.
   The fort's Irish garrison held out and the siege was abandoned in
   December of that year. However in July [65]1650 [66]Henry Ireton
   renewed the siege and the fort and town surrendered after the fall of
   Waterford, but before their food and supplies had run
   out.^[[67]citation needed]

   In the [68]Williamite war in Ireland ([69]1689-[70]91) [71]James II,
   after his defeat at the [72]battle of the Boyne, embarked at Duncannon
   for [73]Kinsale and then to exile in [74]France. Later his son in law
   and enemy [75]William of Orange, marched on its cobblestones as the
   town and fort surrendered to his army without resistance.^[[76]citation
   needed]

   The fort at Duncannon was one of the few places in county Wexford that
   did not fall to the rebels during the [77]1798 rebellion though a force
   sent out from the fort to defend Wexford town was defeated at the
   [78]battle of Three Rocks. The fort and town then became a
   [79]sanctuary for fleeing [80]loyalists and troops in south Wexford and
   was also used as a [81]prison and place of execution for suspected
   rebels.^[[82]citation needed]

   Duncannon's strategic importance continued to be recognised throughout
   the 19th century. [83]Napoleon sought and got intelligence on its
   strength and weakness, in preparation for a possible invasion of
   Ireland.^[[84]citation needed]

   Duncannon fort was used by the FCA (Irish army reserve) as a barracks
   and training facility until recent years.^[[85]citation needed]
