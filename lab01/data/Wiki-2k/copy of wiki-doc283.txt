[[25]edit] Early life

   Jones was born in [26]Indianapolis, Indiana. After attending [27]Bishop
   Chatard High School, he headed off to [28]Ball State University, where
   he graduated in 1982 with a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications,
   and a minor in [29]Theatre. He learned [30]mime at school, joining a
   troupe called "Mime Over Matter". Also during his stay at BSU, he
   portrayed the school mascot "[31]Charlie Cardinal".

[[32]edit] Career

   Jones has worked as a [33]contortionist. "Youd be surprised how many
   times that comes into play in commercials. Theyll want somebody to hold
   a box of Tide funny or something. I once squished into a box for a
   [34]commercial for relaxed fit jeans".^[35][1]

   Although known mostly for his work under [36]prosthetic makeup, such as
   the zombie Billy Butcherson in the Halloween film [37]Hocus Pocus, or
   the lead Spy Morlock in the [38]2002 remake of [39]The Time Machine, he
   has also performed without prosthetics in such films as
   [40]Adaptation., [41]Mystery Men and [42]Batman Returns, and indie
   projects such as Stefan Haves' [43]Stalled, [44]AntiKaiser Productions'
   [45]Three Lives, Phil Donlon's [46]A Series of Small Things and as
   'Cesare' in David Fisher's 2005 remake of the 1919 silent classic
   [47]The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. His performance as [48]Abe Sapien in
   [49]Hellboy, which opened at the top of the U.S. box office in the
   spring of 2004, brought him an even higher profile and much praise from
   audiences and critics alike. Explaining the challenge of working so
   often in rubber suits and prosthetics, he notes, "I have to make that a
   part of my being and my physicality and again, acting is a full body
   experience and that's a part of it when you're doing a costumed
   character."^[50][2]

   In 2005, he renewed his association with Mexican director [51]Guillermo
   del Toro, starring as the Faun in del Toro's multi-Oscar-winning
   Spanish language fantasy/horror project [52]El Laberinto del Fauno
   (Pan's Labyrinth). He also has a secondary role in the film as 'The
   Pale Man', a gruesome creature with a penchant for eating children.
   Working once more under heavy prosthetics in both roles, he was also
   required to learn large amounts of dialogue in Spanish, though his
   voice was ultimately re-dubbed.^[[53]citation needed]

   The year also brought success for [54]The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the
   film receiving three awards at the [55]Screamfest Horror Festival in
   Los Angeles, including the Audience Choice Award.^[56][3] In 2006 Jones
   appeared in the feature films [57]The Benchwarmers and [58]Lady in the
   Water, and reprised his role as [59]Abe Sapien by voicing the character
   in the new [60]Hellboy Animated television project, recording two
   75-minute [61]animated films.

   In June 2007 he appeared in [62]Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver
   Surfer as the [63]Silver Surfer (though [64]Laurence Fishburne
   portrayed the character's voice). He reprised his role as [65]Abe
   Sapien in [66]Hellboy II: The Golden Army, once more under the
   direction of [67]Guillermo del Toro, for which he played both the voice
   and body performance. He also played two other roles in the film: the
   Angel of Death and The Chamberlain, both under heavy prosthetics. Jones
   is open to playing more creatures in Del Toro's planned two-part
   [68]The Hobbit adaptation, as well as his version of
   [69]Frankenstein.^[70][4]

   On 20th January, 2009, cameras rolled on Doug in the French-language
   film [71]Serge Gainsbourg: Vie Heroique, written and directed by French
   comic-book author Joann Sfar and produced by Universal Europe. Doug's
   role has not yet been made public, but it is known that he is working
   under prosthetics designed and created by the Oscar-winning Spanish FX
   shop DDT Efectos Especiales, with whom he worked on [72]Pan's
   Labyrinth.

   Jones starred as himself in Sockbaby 4, the fourth installment of the
   Internet [73]martial arts comedy series [74]Sockbaby.^[75][5]

   Jones' likeness was used for [76]Nvidia's "Human Head" tech
   demo.^[77][6]
