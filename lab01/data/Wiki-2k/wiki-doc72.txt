   The [9]neutrality of this article is [10]disputed.
   Please see the discussion on the [11]talk page. (March 2008)
   Please do not remove this message until the [12]dispute is resolved.

   The DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process
   (DIACAP) is the [13]United States [14]Department of Defense (DoD)
   process to ensure that [15]risk management is applied on
   [16]information systems (IS). DIACAP defines a DoD-wide formal and
   standard set of activities, general tasks and a management structure
   process for the certification and accreditation (C&A) of a DoD IS that
   will maintain the [17]information assurance (IA) posture throughout the
   [18]system's life cycle.

   An interim version of the DIACAP was signed July 6, 2006 and superseded
   [19]DITSCAP. The final version is titled Department of Defense
   Instruction 8510.01 and was signed on November 28, 2007. It supersedes
   the Interim DIACAP Guidance.

[[20]edit] History

   The philosophical and managerial motivations behind DIACAP and its
   logical forerunner, [21]DITSCAP, derive from accreditation work
   performed for a spectrum of customers by Barry Stauffer of CORBETT
   Technologies, long since purchased by BAE Systems. The technical
   requirements of the process ultimately derive from a comprehensive
   [22]requirements traceability matrix (RTM) prepared for CORBETT in
   response to a gamut of needs for Office of Justice Programs, Drug
   Enforcement Administrations, and United States Marshals service by
   Bruce Wilner of Network Security Laboratories.

   The major change in DIACAP from DITSCAP is the embracing of the idea of
   information assurance controls (defined in DoDD 8500.1 and DoDI 8500.2)
   as the primary set of security requirements for all automated
   information systems (AISs). The IA Controls are determined based on the
   system's mission assurance category (MAC) and confidentiality level
   (CL).
