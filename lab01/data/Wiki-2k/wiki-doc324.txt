   Yonne class cutter

   Thomas Harrison Butler ([14]19 March [15]1871 - [16]29 January
   [17]1945) was a [18]British [19]ophthalmologist and amateur boat
   designer. He published various designs of small, traditionally built
   yacht and was particularly concerned with the boat's handling under
   sail.

   Harrison Butler was "a strong believer in the 'metacentric shelf
   formula' to achieve good balance and handling under sail. The theory
   held that as a yacht heels under sail, its balance will depend on the
   immersed form of the hull, with different sections exerting varying
   degrees of buoyancy and aft sections possibly being more buoyant than
   forward sections. Metacentric shelf analysis plots the shifts in the
   varying buoyancies as a net value to windward or leeward and serves as
   a guide to achieving equal buoyancy in the dissimilar ends of a design.
   The work can now be done by computer, but when it was applied by the
   brain, hand and eye of Dr. Harrison Butler it produced famously
   sweet-handling boats, in the age of heavy weather helm."^[20][1]

   In the days before computers, Harrison Butler was known to cut out
   paper cross sections of his hulls in order to calculate lines of
   symmetry and centres of mass. Boats built to his designs are noted for
   their sleek looks as well as their pleasant handling.

   He wrote two books, Cruising Yachts: Design and Performance, and An
   Illustrated Guide to the Slit-Lamp. and was the subject of a 1980s BBC
   TV documentary.

[[29]edit] The Harrison Butler Association

   A [30]Harrison Butler Association was formed in 1973 for anyone
   interested in his designs. It aims to keep track of Harrison Butler
   boats worldwide and help owners keep in touch. It holds two meetings
   and produces two newsletters annually.

   Harrison Butler was the father-in-law of actress [32]Joan Hickson.
