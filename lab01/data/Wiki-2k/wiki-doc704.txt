Earl of Egremont

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Earls of Egremont was a title in the [8]Peerage of Great Britain. It
   was created in 1749, along with the subsidiary title of Baron
   Cockermouth, for Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset, with remainder
   to his nephews Sir Charles Wyndham, 4th Baronet, of Orchard Wyndham,
   and Percy Wyndham-OBrien. The Duke had previously inherited the Percy
   estates, including the lands of Egremont in Cumberland, from his mother
   Lady Elizabeth Percy, daughter and heiress of [9]Joceline Percy, 11th
   Earl of Northumberland. In 1750 Sir Charles Wyndham succeeded according
   to the special remainder as second Earl of Egremont on the death of his
   uncle. His younger brother was [10]Percy Wyndham-O'Brien, 1st Earl of
   Thomond of the second creation.

   The Wyndham Baronetcy, of [11]Orchard Wyndham in the County of
   Somerset, had been created in the [12]Baronetage of England in 1661 for
   William Wyndham, who represented [13]Somerset and [14]Taunton in
   Parliament. His son, the second Baronet, represented [15]Ilchester in
   the [16]House of Commons. He was succeeded by his only son, the third
   Baronet, a prominent politician who notably served as [17]Chancellor of
   the Exchequer. He married Lady Catherine Seymour, daughter of
   [18]Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset. His eldest son was the
   fourth Baronet, who succeeded as second Earl of Egremont in 1750.

   The second Earl's eldest son and successor, the third Earl, was known
   as a patron of art. He also sponsored the [19]Petworth Emigration
   Scheme, which sent thousands of working-class people from the south of
   England to [20]Upper Canada between 1832 and 1837. On his death the
   titles passed to his nephew, the fourth Earl. When he died in 1845 the
   Barony of Cockermouth and Earldom of Egremont became extinct. The large
   Wyndham estates, including [21]Petworth House in [22]Sussex had already
   passed to Colonel George Wyndham. He was the natural son and adopted
   heir of the third Earl. In 1859 he was raised to the peerage as Baron
   Leconfield. Moreover, in 1963 the Egremont title was revived for his
   great-great-grandson John Edward Reginald Wyndham, who was created
   Baron Egremont, of Petworth in the County of Sussex. In 1967 he
   succeeded his father as sixth Baron Leconfield.

   Another member of the Wyndham family was [23]Thomas Wyndham, 1st Baron
   Wyndham, [24]Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1726 to 1739. He was the
   grandson of [25]Sir Wadham Wyndham, uncle of Sir William Wyndham, 1st
   Baronet, of Orchard Wyndham.
