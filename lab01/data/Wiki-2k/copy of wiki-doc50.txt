Dixwell Baronets

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   There have been three Baronetcies created for members of the Dixwell
   family, all of whom are descended from Charles Dixwell (d 1591) of
   [8]Coton House, near [9]Churchover, [10]Warwickshire. All three
   Baronetcies are extinct.

   The Baronetcy of Dixwell of Tirlington, Kent was created in the
   Baronetage of England for Basil Dixwell, the youngest son of Charles,
   on 27 February 1628. He had inherited the estate of a maternal uncle
   near Folkestone, Kent and was [11]Member of Parliament for [12]Hythe in
   1626 and [13]High Sheriff of Kent in 1627. In 1622 he built a new
   mansion at [14]Broome Hall near Canterbury which became his principal
   residence. He died without issue and the Baronetcy was extinct.

   The Baronetcy of Dixwell of Broome House, Kent was created on 19 June
   1660, for Basil Dixwell great nephew and heir of Sir Basil Dixwell of
   Tirlington, from whom he inherited the Broome House estate. His son the
   second Baronet was Governor of Dover Castle, and Member of Parliament
   for [15]Dover 1689-90 and 1699-1700. He died without issue and the
   Baronetcy was extinct. The estate passed to his sister Elizabeth
   Oxenden ( see [16]Oxenden Baronets).

   The Baronetcy of Dixwell of Coton House was created on 11 June 1716 for
   William Dixwell, (great great grandson of Charles Dixwell) , who was
   [17]High Sheriff of Warwickshire in that year. It was extinct on his
   death.
