[[41]edit] Earthworm Jim

   Earthworm Jim is a [42]video game character, the protagonist of the
   [43]Earthworm Jim [44]video games and [45]animated series. For most of
   his life Jim was just an ordinary [46]earthworm engaging in normal worm
   activities, such as eating dirt, crawling, and fleeing from hungry
   birds, until one day wherein [47]fate should happen to smile upon him
   and his life was changed forever. A fearsome bounty hunter named
   [48]Psy-Crow was enroute to deliver the
   "[49]Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit" to
   [50]Queen Slug-For-A-Butt but got in a confrontation with another space
   ship and lost the suit out of an airlock. The suit fell to earth
   landing on a farm somewhere in the southern [51]United States. While
   fleeing from a flock of hungry [52]crows Jim took refuge in the
   mysterious suit. The suit's powerful atomic particles affected Jim's
   wormy flesh and caused him to grow and evolve at a fantastic rate. Upon
   discovering his newfound powers granted by the suit, he overhears
   Psy-Crow talking to [53]Queen Slug-For-A-Butt, and becomes interested
   in meeting the queen's twin sister, [54]Princess What's-Her-Name,
   setting up the events of the first game. Through the games, Jim travels
   to many planets and faces many villains who are after the suit. In
   [55]Earthworm Jim 2, Jim must rescue Princess What's-Her-Name when she
   is kidnapped by Psy-Crow. In the television show, Jim (voiced by
   [56]Dan Castellaneta) has an almost identical origin, but now resides
   in a home in the city of Terlawk (a play on [57]Turlock, California,
   the birthplace of [58]Douglas TenNapel) with [59]Peter Puppy. Most of
   the villains from the game still show up from time to time to give him
   trouble.

   Jim can be a bit naive, is somewhat of a degenerate and rarely thinks
   before rushing into battle, but on occasions can be very cunning. Jim
   is also very gullible, even trusting villains in not-so-convincing
   disguises. His motto is "When all else fails, start blasting!" Jim also
   has a rather large romantic infatuation with Princess What's-Her-Name,
   which usually confuses her, but he never falters in his resolve. Jim
   also appears to be childish, enjoying pop-up books, snowglobes, and
   other childish things. In the games, Jim has a slight southern drawl
   and says phrases like "Groovy!" or "Whoa, Nelly!". In the animated
   series his drawl has all but disappeared, but still retains his
   "Groovy!" catchphrase. Jim has a tendency to use big words and long
   drawn-out phrases. It is not uncommon for him to yell something like
   "We are all doomed! From the middle-English meaning 'condemned to
   ruination or death'! DOOOOMED!!" or "By the Great Worm Spirit, whose
   mighty bristles strike the hammerblows of justice". His battle cry is
   "Eat Dirt, (persons or things in question)!", which he usually follows
   up by laughing maniacally. This too can become long and drawn-out with
   phrases like "Eat dirt, everyone in the vicinity!" or "Eat dirt, evil
   banana-suited doofus!" He is also a playable fighter in [60]Clayfighter
   63 1/3 and an unlockable fighter in Clayfighter 63 1/3: Sculptor's Cut.
   Another little known appearance is in the game "[61]Battle Arena
   Toshinden", but only in the PC version. There was also a clever
   reference to Jim in the PC game [62]Sacrifice wherein you could choose
   to serve the god James, the earth god, in your quest. Your ultimate
   spell from James is Bovine Intervention, almost certainly a reference
   to the Earthworm Jim games running gag with cow jokes, particularly
   since Sacrifice was also developed by [63]Shiny Entertainment.

   Earthworm Jim was awarded Best New Character of 1994 by [64]Electronic
   Gaming Monthly.^[65][3]

[[101]edit] Earthworm Jim for PSP

   In 2006, [102]Atari announced that they had the rights to bring
   Earthworm Jim to a portable video game system.^[103][9] The game was
   80% complete in August 2006 and was to be released in the winter of
   2006.^[104][10] Many new elements were to be introduced, such as the
   ability to stop gameplay at any time and dance.^[105][11] On [106]18
   June [107]2007, PSPFanboy stated on their website that they had
   contacted Atari and that it had been said that the game had been put on
   hold, probably due to Atari's financial difficulties and the sale of
   the games developer [108]Shiny Entertainment, and it is thought that
   the game is canceled.^[109][12]

[[110]edit] Earthworm Jim 4

   Earthworm Jim 4 has been announced. The game will be developed with
   character creator [111]Douglas TenNapel, who will also serve as the
   project's creative consultant.

[[124]edit] Recurring gameplay elements

   All the games in the series are platformer games with quirky humor.

[[125]edit] Items

   The Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit or simply
   Super Suit is the main plot point of the Earthworm Jim [126]video games
   and [127]animated series. Originally created by [128]Professor
   Monkey-For-A-Head for [129]Queen Slug-for-a-Butt, it was found by
   [130]an earthworm named Jim when [131]Psy-Crow lost it during delivery.
   Throughout the Earthworm Jim video games and television series numerous
   villains attempt to steal the suit from Jim, to no avail. The suit is
   claimed to be one of the most powerful weapons in the galaxy. It
   responds to the wearer's thoughts, granting them immense strength,
   agility, and durability. The suit is equipped with a Plasma Blaster and
   a single-person [132]spacecraft stored inside. Jim refers to it as the
   "Pocket Rocket". The suit's arms are able to stretch to form a
   protective shield in the shape of a [133]manta ray. According to the
   animated series, the suit receives power from a "Battery of the Gods,"
   but has a renewable energy system in the games with extremely large
   macromolecules of fuel scattered throughout each game level. The suit
   appears to have a degree of [134]sentience, being able to wave and
   signal to Jim if they are separated, as well as being able to grab Jim
   and use him in different manners, such as a whip or jump rope. Starting
   with [135]Earthworm Jim 2, the suit has a green mucus-like creature
   named [136]Snott living in its backpack. In the video games, Snott can
   be used to swing from place to place as well as to slow Jim's fall by
   acting a parachute. Snott guards the suit whenever Jim needs to leave
   it momentarily. It is interesting to note that the Super Suit wears
   white boxers with red hearts underneath its white pants. (as seen in
   [137]Earthworm Jim)

   The Plasma Blaster is the main weapon of the Super Suit. Like the Super
   Suit, the Plasma blaster was created by [138]Professor
   Monkey-For-A-Head for use by [139]Queen Slug-For-A-Butt, but was lost
   along with the suit to Earthworm Jim. It is a small, hand held gun that
   fires bolts of "plasma" energy. The Plasma Blaster, unlike the
   "[140]Pocket Rocket, is clearly visible at all times, being strapped in
   a holster to the left side of the Super Suit for easy access. The
   Plasma Blaster seems to be as durable as the Super Suit itself, being
   exposed to the extreme temperatures of space and planetary re-entry and
   even operating underwater and still functioning. In the [141]games, the
   plasma blaster has an ammunition counter. If the counter fell to zero
   the blaster was able to slowly recharge itself back to a maximum of 100
   rounds, but the player was forced to collect Plasma Blaster icons to
   refill ammunition any higher. This would leave the player fairly
   vulnerable to enemy attacks. There were also Mega Plasma Blaster icons
   scattered about levels, allowing the player to shoot a long, powerful
   blast. In the Special Edition of the game, the plasma blaster could
   also be equipped with Homing Missile ammunition, which would target any
   nearby enemy without having to aim. In [142]Earthworm Jim 2 different
   types of guns were added in addition to the plasma blaster. They
   included:
     * Mega Plasma Blaster (EWJ2 version) - Much like the original, but
       with a bigger gun and a larger blast.
     * Homing Missile Gun (EWJ2 version) - Similar to the previous
       version, but now with missiles shaped like small houses ("Home"-ing
       missile).
     * Three-Finger Gun - Jim's fingers becomes three separate guns,
       giving the player a wider range of fire.
     * Barn Burner Gun - Large brick gun that destroys all enemies on
       screen, but packs a nasty recoil. Jim is knocked to the ground
       momentarily after each use.
     * Bubble Gun - Much like the toy, a gun that shoots soap bubbles. It
       is useless against enemies and should be avoided.
     * Digging Gun - Resembles the normal Plasma Blaster, but could shoot
       a continuous stream of energy to move dirt around on [143]Planet
       Burbank.

   In the animated series, the Plasma Blaster was constantly used by Jim
   as the answer to all problems, falling under the category of "Plan A:
   Senseless Violence". His motto is "When all else fails, start
   blasting!" It was also discovered that the energy bolts fired have the
   exact same charge as the particles around the central radius of a
   [144]black hole.

   The Pocket Rocket is a single person spacecraft and Earthworm Jim's
   main mode of transportation. The Pocket Rocket is a small personal
   rocket ship stored inside the Suit and looks like a turbine engine with
   handle bars. Whenever Jim needs it, it is pulled from one of the suit's
   pockets, hence the name. It is unknown how the rocket fits inside the
   suit, as it is much bigger, but it is assumed that it fits into some
   sort of [145]extra-dimensional space. The rocket, like the Super Suit,
   was created by [146]Professor Monkey-For-A-Head for use by [147]Queen
   Slug-For-A-Butt but was lost along with the suit to Earthworm Jim. Jim
   uses it as his primary mode of transportation, flying to various
   planets and locations. While on the rocket, Jim seems to have no
   problem breathing in the cold-vacuum of space, even though the Pocket
   Rocket is not enclosed in any way. This may be due to either the
   rocket, Jim's Super Suit or just Jim's earthworm [148]physiology.
   However, in the animated series Peter Puppy can also be seen riding the
   rocket in space with no ill-effects, so it can be assumed the rocket
   supplies some sort of life support systems or that it is just an
   example of [149]cartoon physics. The Pocket Rocket seems to be as
   durable as the Super Suit itself, being battered by asteroids, being
   exposed to the extreme heat of planetary re-entry and even operating
   underwater and still functioning. In the line of Earthworm Jim action
   figures, the Pocket Rocket was the only vehicle ever produced.

[[150]edit] Video game series exclusive items

   The following items only appeared in the Earthworm Jim [151]video game
   series.
     * Suit Atom

   A small macro-molecule that restores 4% health (lower on higher
   difficulties and 5% in Earthworm Jim 3D) to the super suit if it is
   damaged. Scattered around most levels.
     * Ultra Suit Atom

   A larger, orange macro-molecule that restores the Super Suit to 100%
   health. It is only scarcely found in most levels.
     * [152]Chip Butty

   A special power-up that appears to be a [153]sandwich containing
   [154]chips and [155]ketchup, found only in Earthworm Jim 2. This allows
   to super suit to reach 200% health. However, normal power cells will
   not heal the suit until it is damaged beneath 100% again.
     * Atomic Accelerator

   Found in the "Andy Asteroids?" levels of Earthworm Jim, this warp will
   give Jim's Pocket Rocket a sudden burst of speed.
     * Asteroid Shield

   Again, only found in the "Andy Asteroids?" levels, this item will give
   Jim a use of a temporary asteroid-proof shield that will also send
   [156]Psy-crow aside.
     * Fuel Pod

   Another "Andy Asteroids?" exclusive, it basically is a little blue
   bubble. Should the player collect 50 or more of these pods, they will
   gain a continue (a can of worms).
     * Can O'Worms

   The Can O'Worms serves as a continue for EWJ 1 and 2.
     * Mealworm

   An EWJ2 exclusive, and further on that, a two level ("Villi
   People/Jim's Now a Blind Cave Salamander!" and "Inflated Head")
   exclusive, they are used as method of payment for a question or a whack
   of the punch tower.
     * Jim Head

   In EWJ 1 and 2, this serves as a 1-up.
     * Mini Rockets

   An exclusive to the Mega-CD/Sega CD/PC "Special Edition" EWJ 1
   port,they are homing missiles which blow away enemies with the force of
   a Mega Plasma shot.
     * Ammo Bullet

   This item will give the player more units of whichever blaster they are
   currently using. The number ammo units provided depends on the blaster.
     * Mega Plasma

   An EWJ 1 exclusive, it looks like a normal ammo pickup, but it has
   power ripples pulsing around it. It provides one Mega Plasma shot.
     * 1-UP Heart

   An EWJ 3D exclusive, it replaces the Jim head for a 1-up.
     * Password Flag

   A special item in Earthworm Jim 2, when all three flags are collected,
   after the game is completed, the player may play any level he chooses.
   Each level has a flag with a picture of the Earth, A flag with a
   picture of an Earthworm, and a flag with the word Jim on it, spelling
   out the title characters full name: Earthworm Jim.
     * Marbles

   A special item exclusive to Earthworm Jim 3D, this is an item which are
   scattered all over each level. Collecting the marbles allows for secret
   areas to be opened and for Golden Udders to be found.
     * Golden Udder

   A special item exclusive to Earthworm Jim 3D, this is collected when
   enough marbles are obtained, or when a special mission is completed.
   Golden Udders unlock more areas of the game.

[[157]edit] Animated series exclusive items

   The following items only appeared in the Earthworm Jim [158]animated
   series
     * Battery of the Gods - One of the main plot points of the animated
       series, the battery of the gods is a power source created by the
       gods with almost limitless power. It was used by Professor
       Monkey-For-A-Head to power the super suit. When the original suit
       was lost, the Professor was unable to build a suit with the same
       level of power without another Battery of the Gods. Since the only
       place to get one is the Fabled, Long-Sought Home of the Gods, very
       few people have access to them. Jim was aided in his quest for a
       new battery by The Fabled, Long-Sought Phonebook of the Gods, where
       the gods granted him a new battery after seeing his skill and
       playing the nose flute. The battery itself looks like a large
       9-volt battery with an orange wrapper. The Battery of the Gods was
       planned to be a power-up for the cancelled game [159]Earthworm Jim
       PSP

     * The Fabled, Long-Sought Phonebook of the Gods - One of the few ways
       to find the Fabled, Long-Sought Home of the Gods. Jim was able to
       return to get a new battery for the super suit because he, for some
       reason, possessed this phone book. Outwardly, it seems to be a
       normal phone book.

     * The Sword of Righteousness - An enchanted talking sword, the Sword
       of Righteousness claims to be a trainer of true heroes. He was
       found by Jim in an ancient vending machine sandwich and began
       training him shortly after. Jim followed the sword's instructions
       exactly, with disastrous results, until the sword revealed that no
       one he has ever trained has ever won a fight. Jim thus reverted
       back to his old fighting style and threw the sword into outer
       space.

     * The Orb of Quite Remarkable Power - A powerful orb which grants the
       user almost unlimited power. Much like a [160]Green Lantern ring
       the orb can make energy constructs of the user's thoughts, thus
       making its only limitation the user's imagination. For some reason
       the Orb is not very well protected and kept on The Planet of Easily
       Frightened People, where it was easily stolen by Psy-Crow.

     * The Eggbeater - An [161]eggbeater Jim borrowed from his next door
       neighbor, Mrs. Bleverage, to help defeat Bob the Killer Goldfish.
       Jim subsequently left the eggbeater on [162]La Planeta de Agua
       (Arriba!) and had to take Mrs. Bleverage on a long journey to
       retrieve it. After finally retrieving the eggbeater from Jim's
       foes, it is shown that it is not Mrs. Bleverage's eggbeater, as
       hers has a brown handle. He proposes another long journey to
       recover the true eggbeater (which was actually in his pocket all
       along, which he finds out while on Insectika).

[[163]edit] Television series

          Main article: [164]Earthworm Jim (TV series)

   An animated series based on the Earthworm Jim series of video games was
   also produced, and ran for 23 episodes in 2 seasons from 19951996 on
   the Kids' WB programming block on The WB Television Network.^[165][14]
   The show maintains much of the absurdist and surreal humor of the
   original games, as well as introducing its own features. Most of the
   episodes revolve around one of Jim's many villains trying to reclaim
   the super suit, or otherwise causing mayhem through the galaxy. Actor
   [166]Dan Castellaneta, who voices [167]Homer Simpson on the animated
   television show [168]The Simpsons, voiced Earthworm Jim in the animated
   series.^[169][15]
