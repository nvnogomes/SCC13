   [18]Middletown, Ohio
   Political party [19]Republican

   Edward Lee "Ed" Schrock (born [20]April 6, [21]1941) is a
   [22]Republican politician who was a member of the [23]United States
   House of Representatives from January [24]2001 to January [25]2005,
   representing the Second Congressional District of [26]Virginia.

   Born in [27]Middletown, [28]Ohio, Schrock earned a degree from
   [29]Alderson-Broaddus College in [30]1964 and a Masters Degree in
   Public Relations from [31]American University in [32]1975. He also
   served in the [33]United States Navy from [34]1964 to [35]1988,
   including two tours of duty in [36]Vietnam. Schrock then worked as an
   investment broker and served in the [37]Virginia State Senate from
   [38]1995 to [39]2001. In 2000, he was elected to the U.S. House seat in
   Virginia's 2nd District, defeating the Democratic Party nominee,
   [40]Jody Wagner, a Norfolk attorney who later became State Treasurer of
   Virginia. During his four years in Congress, he served on the [41]Armed
   Services Committee, [42]Budget Committee, [43]Small Business Committee,
   and [44]Government Reform Committee. In his first term in Congress,
   Schrock was elected president of the Republican Freshman
   Class^[[45]citation needed].

   Schrock announced on [46]August 30, [47]2004, that he would abort his
   2004 attempt for a third term in Congress. In the weeks before his
   announcement, [48]Michael Rogers' blogACTIVE.com had said that Schrock
   is [49]gay or at least a [50]bisexual despite having aggressively
   opposed various [51]gay-rights issues in Congress such as [52]same-sex
   marriage and gays in the military^[53][1].

   On November 2, in the [54]general election, fellow Republican
   [55]Thelma Drake was elected to replace Schrock. Drake took office in
   January 2005^[[56]citation needed].

   In December 2004, Representative [57]Tom Davis, another Virginia
   Republican, hired Schrock to serve as the top staff person for one of
   the subcommittees of the Government Reform Committee, which Davis
   chairs and on which Schrock had served^[[58]citation needed].
