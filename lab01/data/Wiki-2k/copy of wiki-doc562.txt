   Dwayne Johnson^[11][1] (born May 2, 1972)^[12][2] also known by his
   former [13]ring name The Rock, and occasionally credited as Dwayne "The
   Rock" Johnson, is an [14]American [15]actor and former [16]professional
   wrestler.^[17][3] Johnson was a [18]collegiate football player, and in
   1991, he was part of the [19]University of Miami's national
   championship team. He later played for the [20]Calgary Stampeders in
   the [21]Canadian Football League, but was cut two months into the
   season.^[22][4] This led to his decision to become a professional
   wrestler, like his grandfather, [23]Peter Maivia and his father
   [24]Rocky Johnson.

   He gained mainstream fame as a wrestler in [25]World Wrestling
   Entertainment (WWE), then known as the World Wrestling Federation
   (WWF), from 1996 to 2004, and was the first third-generation superstar
   in wrestling history. Johnson was quickly given a push in WWE, first as
   "Rocky Maivia", and then as "The Rock", a member of the [26]Nation of
   Domination. Two years after he joined the WWE, Johnson won the [27]WWF
   Championship, and became one of the most popular wrestlers within the
   company for his engaging interviews and promos. Since 2001, he has
   focused on an acting career, though he still makes occasional WWE
   appearances for promotional purposes.

   Johnson was a nine-time [28]World Heavyweight Champion in his career,
   being a seven-time WWE Champion and two-time [29]WCW Champion; his last
   reign was as [30]WWE Undisputed Champion in 2002. He also won the
   [31]WWF Intercontinental Championship twice and is a former five-time
   [32]WWE Tag Team Champion. He also was the winner of the [33]2000 Royal
   Rumble.

   Johnson is also an actor, with his first leading role in 2001, in
   [34]The Scorpion King. For this film, he received the highest salary
   for an actor in his first starring role, earning [35]$5.5 million. He
   has since appeared in movies such as [36]The Rundown, [37]Be Cool,
   [38]The Game Plan, [39]Gridiron Gang, [40]Doom, [41]Race to Witch
   Mountain and [42]Get Smart.

[[63]edit] Biography

[[64]edit] Early life

   Dwayne Johnson, the son of Ata ([65]ne Maivia) and [66]professional
   wrestler [67]"Soulman" Rocky Johnson, was born in [68]Hayward,
   California.^[69][2] His maternal grandfather, "High Chief" [70]Peter
   Maivia, was also a professional wrestler. His maternal grandmother,
   [71]Leah Maivia, ran Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling from 1982 until
   1988 following her husband's death, becoming one of wrestling's few
   female professional [72]promoters.^[73][5] He is of half [74]Black
   Canadian, half [75]Samoan heritage (his father is Black Canadian, more
   specifically [76]Black Nova Scotian, and his mother is Samoan).^[77][6]
   For a brief period, Johnson lived in [78]Auckland, New Zealand, with
   his mother's family.^[79][7] During this time his mother Ata ensured
   Johnson was exposed to one of the [80]urban Polynesian cultural
   strongholds of the Southern Hemisphere.^[81][7] Johnson attended
   Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S. with his
   parents.^[82][7]

   Living a short time in [83]Hamden, Connecticut he spent part of his
   childhood in town, attending [84]Shepherd Glen Elementary and
   [85]Hamden Middle School.^[[86]citation needed] He spent 10th grade at
   [87]President William McKinley High School in [88]Honolulu, Hawaii. As
   he entered 11th grade, Johnson's father's job required his relocation
   to [89]Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the state's [90]Lehigh Valley
   region. He began playing [91]football at Bethlehem's [92]Freedom High
   School in the highly competitive [93]Lehigh Valley Conference.^[94][6]
   In addition to playing football at Freedom High School, he also was a
   member of the high school's [95]track and field and [96]wrestling
   teams.^[97][6]

[[98]edit] Education, football and philanthropy

   Johnson received collegiate football scholarship offers from several
   universities and selected the [99]University of Miami. While the
   [100]University of Miami football program did not openly recruit
   Johnson, he entered try-outs as a [101]walk-on for the program and made
   the team, playing [102]defensive tackle. In 1991, he was part of the
   Miami Hurricanes' [103]national championship team.^[104][8] After an
   injury kept him sidelined, Johnson was replaced by fellow Hurricane and
   future [105]NFL star [106]Warren Sapp.^[107][6]
   Dwayne Johnson greeting fans in 2006

   Johnson met his future wife, Dany Garcia, who also was attending Miami
   at the time. Garcia, who graduated from the University of Miami in
   1992, is a member of the University of Miami's Board of
   Trustees,^[108][9] and the founder of a Miami-based wealth management
   firm. The two have remained close to their alma mater, giving a $2
   million donation in 2006 to build a living room at the university's
   alumni center. Johnson graduated from the University of Miami in 1995
   with a degree in [109]criminology.^[110][6] On November 10, 2007 he
   returned to the [111]Orange Bowl in Miami to participate in the
   festivities surrounding the University of Miami's last home football
   game at the stadium.

   Johnson continued his football career in 1995, joining the [112]Calgary
   Stampeders of the [113]Canadian Football League after being passed over
   by the NFL, but he was cut two months into the season.^[114][4]

   In 2006, Johnson began "The Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation", which is
   known for its charitable work with at-risk and terminally ill
   children.^[115][10] On October 2, 2007, Johnson and his wife donated an
   additional $1 million to the University of Miami to support the
   university's football facilities renovation; it was noted as the
   largest donation ever given to the university's athletics department by
   former students. The University of Miami plans to rename the
   Hurricanes' locker room in Johnson's honor.^[116][11]

[[117]edit] Personal life and politics

   Johnson married Dany Garcia on May 3, 1997, a day after his 25th
   birthday.^[118][12] His best man at the wedding was fellow wrestler and
   long-time family friend [119]Tonga "Haku" Fifita. Johnson and his wife
   have a daughter, Simone Alexandra, born August 14, 2001.^[120][12] On
   June 1, 2007, Johnson and Garcia announced that they would be splitting
   up after 10 years of marriage.^[121][12] They indicated that their
   parting was amicable and that they would spend the rest of their lives
   together as best friends.^[122][12]

   In 2000, Johnson delivered a speech at the [123]Republican National
   Convention.^[124][3] Because his mother, Ata Maivia, had royal blood,
   Samoan [125]King Malietoa Tanumafili II bestowed Johnson with the noble
   title of Seiuli during his visit to Samoa in July 2004.^[126][13] He is
   a supporter of the [127]Samoan national rugby team, as the team's
   website during the run-up to the [128]2007 Rugby World Cup showed him
   holding a personalized Manu Samoa jersey with "The Rock" emblazoned on
   the back.^[129][14]

   Retired 2004

   Along with his father and grandfather, several members of Johnson's
   family are current and former professional wrestlers, including his
   uncles, the [150]Wild Samoans ([151]Afa and [152]Sika Anoa'i) and
   cousins, such as [153]Manu, [154]Yokozuna, [155]Rikishi, [156]Rosey,
   and [157]Umaga.^[158][7] When he declared his intention to join the
   family business, his father resisted, but agreed to train his son
   himself, warning him that he would not go easy on him.^[159][6] With
   help from veteran wrestler [160]Pat Patterson, Johnson had several
   tryout matches with WWE in 1996; he defeated [161]The Brooklyn Brawler
   at a house show, and lost the others to [162]Chris Candido and
   [163]Owen Hart.^[164][7] Impressed by his talent and charisma, Johnson
   was signed to a deal after a short stint for "seasoning" in [165]Jerry
   Lawler's [166]United States Wrestling Association, where he wrestled
   under the ring name "Flex Kavana".^[167][17] While there, he won the
   [168]USWA World Tag Team Championship twice with Bart Sawyer in the
   summer of 1996.^[169][17]

   Johnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, which combined his father
   and grandfather's ring names; Johnson was initially reluctant to the
   idea, but was persuaded to go ahead with the name by Vince McMahon and
   Jim Ross.^[170][18] In addition to taking on the nickname "The Blue
   Chipper," the WWF played up his connection to his father and
   grandfather, calling him the company's first third-generation
   wrestler.^[171][3]

   Johnson, who was first portrayed as a clean-cut [172]babyface, was
   pushed heavily from the start despite his lack of in-ring experience.
   He debuted at [173]Survivor Series in November 1996 and was the sole
   survivor,^[174][19] and he won the [175]Intercontinental Championship
   from [176]Hunter Hearst Helmsley on [177]Raw on February 13, 1997,
   after only three months in the company.^[178][20]^[179][21] Fans,
   however, quickly grew sick of the one-dimensional good guy character,
   thanks in part to the increasing popularity of [180]Stone Cold Steve
   Austin.^[181][15] As a result, a regular occurrence during Johnson's
   matches was the fans' angry chants of "Die Rocky Die!" and "Rocky
   Sucks!"^[182][15]^[183][17]

[[184]edit] Nation of Domination and feuding with DX (19971998)

          Main article: [185]Nation of Domination

   After losing the Intercontinental Championship to [186]Owen Hart on the
   April 28, 1997 edition of Raw is War,^[187][22] and returning from an
   injury, Johnson was allowed to [188]turn [189]heel. He joined the
   Nation of Domination with Faarooq, D'Lo Brown and Kama, using the
   nickname "The Rock Rocky Maivia", which was quickly shortened to just
   "The Rock."^[190][23] During that time, Johnson attacked and insulted
   the fans in his [191]promos. In sharp contrast to the overly positive
   persona of Rocky Maivia, The Rock was a charismatic bully, eventually
   driving out the group leader, [192]Faarooq in February 1998.^[193][23]
   The Rock also referred to himself in the [194]third person, starting
   many sentences with "The Rock says..."^[195][23]

   Johnson was soon recognized for cutting arguably the best promos in the
   industry. In his 2000 autobiography, Johnson attributed this skill to
   his exceptional performance in [196]speech communications classes at
   Miami, in which he earned "A" grades. At [197]In Your House:
   D-Generation X, Austin defeated The Rock in less than six minutes to
   retain the Intercontinental title.^[198][24] The following night on Raw
   is War, Austin was ordered by [199]Mr. McMahon to forfeit the WWF
   Intercontinental Championship, which Austin handed over to The Rock
   before hitting the [200]Stone Cold Stunner on him.^[201][25]^[202][26]
   Rock spent the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1998 feuding with both
   Austin and [203]Ken Shamrock.^[204][27]^[205][28]

   Johnson next feuded with Faarooq, who was angry at The Rock for
   usurping his position. The two had a title match at [206]Over the Edge,
   where Rock retained the Intercontinental belt.^[207][29] The Rock then
   moved into a feud with [208]Triple H and [209]D-Generation X. Nation
   members fought DX while The Rock fought Triple H over the
   Intercontinental Championship. They first had a [210]two out of three
   falls match at [211]Fully Loaded for Rock's title, where Rock retained
   the belt in controversial fashion.^[212][30] This led to a [213]ladder
   match at [214]SummerSlam where Rock lost the belt.^[215][31] At
   [216]Breakdown, Rock defeated Ken Shamrock and [217]Mankind in a
   [218]triple threat [219]steel cage match to become the #1 contender to
   the [220]WWF Championship before feuding with fellow Nation member
   [221]Mark Henry, effectively disbanding the Nation.^[222][32]^[223][33]

[[224]edit] The Corporation (19981999)

          Main article: [225]The Corporation

   Johnson's popularity as The Rock propelled him to the WWF Championship.
   The Rock began to conduct many entertaining interviews, and thus he
   [226]got over with the fans. Fan reaction effectively [227]turned him
   [228]face, and he began to feud with Mr. McMahon, who said he has a
   "problem with the people" and thus he should target the "People's
   Champion" (as The Rock claimed himself to be). A double-turn occurred
   at [229]Survivor Series, when The Rock defeated the then-[230]heel
   Mankind in the finals of the "Deadly Game" tournament^[231][34] for the
   vacant [232]WWF Championship,^[233][35] to become the first world
   heavyweight champion of African American descent in WWF history and the
   youngest WWF Champion at the time. At the end of the match, The Rock
   applied a [234]Sharpshooter on Mankind. As he did this, [235]McMahon
   called for the bell to be rung and then ordered for The Rock to be
   declared the winner.^[236][34]^[237][35]

   With the plan coming to fruition, The Rock turned heel again and sided
   with Vince McMahon and [238]Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of The
   Corporation [239]stable.^[240][34] This was also a start of a double
   turn, as Mankind was kicked out of The Corporation and made a face
   turn.^[241][36] Later, The Rock had his own pay-per view, [242]Rock
   Bottom: In Your House, where he had a rematch against Mankind for the
   WWF Championship. Mankind won by submission but Mr. McMahon said that
   The Rock did not tap out that The Rock would retain his
   title.^[243][36]^[244][37] The Rock began a feud with Mankind over the
   WWF Championship, during which the title changed hands back and forth
   between the two, first during the main event of the January 4, 1999
   edition of Raw is War, when Mankind defeated The Rock with the help of
   [245]Stone Cold Steve Austin.^[246][38] The Rock captured his second
   WWF Championship in an [247]"I Quit" Match at [248]Royal Rumble in
   early 1999,^[249][39]^[250][40] when a pre-recorded sample of Mankind
   saying "I quit" from an interview segment was played over the sound
   system. This latest reign did not last long, however. In a match that
   counter-programmed the [251]Super Bowl halftime show on January 31,
   1999, Mankind pinned The Rock using a [252]forklift in an [253]Empty
   Arena Match where the competitors used everything from bags of popcorn
   to garbage to punish each other.^[254][41] This feud lasted until
   February 15 edition of Raw is War, where The Rock won his third WWF
   Championship in a ladder match after [255]The Big Show chokeslammed
   Mankind off a ladder.^[256][42]^[257][43]

   With Mankind out of the way, The Rock had to defend his WWF
   Championship at [258]WrestleMania XV, but lost the belt to
   Austin.^[259][44] Rock lost the title rematch to Austin at
   [260]Backlash: In Your House.^[261][45] WWF fans began to cheer The
   Rock despite him being a heel, due to his comedic interviews, promos
   and segments which mocked wrestlers and announcers and made him popular
   to the fans. Rock eventually made his second face turn after being
   betrayed by Shane McMahon and established a feud with [262]The
   Undertaker, Triple H and the [263]Corporate Ministry. During this feud,
   he sometimes found himself fighting alongside Steve Austin. Rock
   defeated Triple H at [264]Over the Edge before losing to WWF Champion
   Undertaker at [265]King of the Ring.^[266][46]^[267][47] He continued
   his rivalry with Triple H, after losing to him in a number one
   contender's match at [268]Fully Loaded.^[269][48]

[[270]edit] The Rock 'n' Sock Connection (1999)

          Main article: [271]Rock 'n' Sock Connection

   Later on, still as a face, besides feuding with Triple H, The Rock also
   feuded with [272]Mr. Ass throughout the summer of 1999, including a
   "Kiss My Ass" match at [273]SummerSlam.^[274][49] In the fall of the
   same year, The Rock found himself in several singles and tag
   championship opportunities. He teamed with former enemy Mankind to
   create the [275]Rock 'n' Sock Connection, after The Rock challenged the
   team of [276]The Undertaker and The [277]Big Show, which led to Mankind
   offering his help.^[278][50] The Rock accepted, and they went on to win
   the [279]WWF Tag Team Championship [280]three
   times.^[281][51]^[282][52]^[283][53] Aside from the championships, the
   team was regarded as one of the most entertaining teams in history, as
   Mankind imitated The Rock, who ignored Mankind, with both wrestlers
   having support from the crowd. The team was also involved in a segment
   which occurred on Raw is War called "This Is Your Life," in which
   Mankind brought out people from The Rock's past, such as his high
   school girlfriend and gym teacher. The segment earned an 8.4
   [284]Nielsen rating and is, to this day, one of the single highest
   rated segments in terms of viewership in Raw
   history.^[285][51]^[286][54]

[[287]edit] Feuds for the WWF Championship (20002001)

   The Rock in the ring at [288]WrestleMania X8.

   At [289]Royal Rumble in early 2000, The Rock entered in the [290]Royal
   Rumble match and lasted until he and [291]The Big Show were the final
   two men. In the final moment of the match, The Big Show was seemingly
   going to dump The Rock over the top rope in a running
   [292]powerslam-like position, but when they got to the apron The Rock
   reversed the throw, sending the Big Show to the outside floor and then
   came back up.^[293][55] The Rock's feet, however, hit the floor first,
   although those watching the event did not see that. The Big Show
   attempted to prove that The Rock's feet, not his, touched the ground
   first. He provided video footage showing that he was the rightful
   winner. Despite that, the decision that The Rock had won the Rumble
   match could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the
   WWF Championship at [294]No Way Out was held, which saw the Big Show
   come out on top after [295]Shane McMahon interfered, knocking The Rock
   in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to finish off his
   opponent with a [296]People's Elbow.^[297][56] The Rock later defeated
   The Big Show on March 13, 2000 edition of Raw is War to regain the
   right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at [298]WrestleMania 2000 in
   a [299]Fatal Four-Way Elimination match where The Big Show and Mick
   Foley competed, as well.^[300][57]^[301][58] Each competitor had a
   McMahon in their corner; for Triple H, his on-screen wife and then
   off-screen girlfriend [302]Stephanie McMahon; for Mick Foley, the
   matriarch [303]Linda McMahon; for The Rock, Vince McMahon; and in Big
   Show's corner, Shane McMahon.^[304][58]^[305][59] Triple H retained the
   title when Vince turned on The Rock, giving him two chair shots,
   allowing Triple H to pin The Rock for the
   three-count.^[306][59]^[307][60]
   The Rock on Raw

   Over the next couple of months The Rock feuded with Triple H over the
   WWF Championship. A month after the match at WrestleMania 2000, The
   Rock had a rematch with Triple H at [308]Backlash in which The Rock won
   his fourth WWF Championship, after Stone Cold Steve Austin made a brief
   return and intervened on The Rock's
   behalf.^[309][61]^[310][62]^[311][63] Later, at [312]Judgment Day, the
   two had an [313]Iron Man match with [314]Shawn Michaels as the special
   guest referee, that saw [315]The Undertaker return.^[316][64] The Rock
   got disqualified and lost the title, as a result of The Undertaker
   attacking Triple H.^[317][64] The following night on Raw is War, The
   Rock got his revenge, taking out the entire [318]McMahon-Helmsley
   Faction with the help of The Undertaker.^[319][65] He later won his
   fifth WWF Championship at [320]King of the Ring in a [321]tag team
   match, which saw him team up with [322]Kane and The Undertaker to fight
   Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon and Triple H.^[323][66]^[324][67] He
   successfully defended the championship against superstars such as
   [325]Chris Benoit, [326]Kurt Angle, Triple H, Kane, The Undertaker, and
   Shane McMahon.^[327][62]^[328][68]^[329][69]

   The Rock later lost the WWF Championship to Angle at [330]No Mercy in
   October.^[331][62]^[332][70] During this time, he [333]feuded with
   [334]Rikishi and defeated him at [335]Survivor
   Series.^[336][62]^[337][71] He also participated in a six-man [338]Hell
   in a Cell match at [339]Armageddon for the WWF Championship, in which
   Kurt Angle retained the title.^[340][62]^[341][72] Around that same
   time, Rock held the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker and
   the duo exchanged the titles with [342]Edge and
   Christian.^[343][62]^[344][73]

   In 2001, The Rock continued his feud with Angle over the WWF
   Championship and eventually settled it at [345]No Way Out. After a
   battle that saw both wrestlers kick out of each other's [346]finishers,
   The Rock finally came out on top and regained the WWF
   Championship.^[347][62]^[348][74]^[349][75] Afterwards, he feuded with
   the [350]Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock went
   into [351]WrestleMania X-Seven as the WWF Champion, but he was defeated
   after a shocking heel turn from Austin, who used Mr. McMahon to win the
   title.^[352][62]^[353][76] During a Steel Cage match with Austin in a
   rematch for the WWF title on the following night's Raw is War, Triple H
   came down to the ring with a sledgehammer. Many thought he was coming
   to aid The Rock, due to the hatred between Austin and Triple H (and an
   argument with Vince earlier in the night), but it transpired that he
   had joined the Austin/McMahon partnership by hitting The Rock
   instead.^[354][77] Austin and Triple H became a Tag Team and called
   themselves "The Two-Man Power Trip."^[355][78] Rock went on to film the
   movie "[356]The Mummy Returns" after a storyline suspension.^[357][17]

          Main article: [359]The Invasion

   He returned in late July 2001 and had to decide if he wanted to join
   the WWF or [360]The Alliance during [361]The Invasion, eventually
   siding with the WWF.^[362][62] At [363]SummerSlam, The Rock defeated
   [364]Booker T to win the [365]WCW
   Championship.^[366][62]^[367][79]^[368][80] He lost the WCW title to
   [369]Chris Jericho, with whom he won the WWF Tag Team Championship
   around the same time, at [370]No Mercy.^[371][81]^[372][82]

   Rock defeated Jericho on November 5 edition of Raw is War for his
   second WCW Championship.^[373][83] The Rock ultimately decided to join
   the WWF in its battle against The Alliance and was involved in a
   "Winner Takes All" match at [374]Survivor Series, which saw him end up
   one on one with Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to be superior to Austin,
   until Chris Jericho, who was also a member of team WWF and was
   eliminated a few minutes before that point, came inside the ring and
   attacked The Rock. Austin took advantage of that and tried to defeat
   The Rock, but Kurt Angle, a supposed teammate of Austin, proved out to
   be a [375]mole planted by Vince McMahon and hit Austin in the head with
   a title belt, allowing The Rock to eliminate him, destroying The
   Alliance once and for all.^[376][62]^[377][84] The Rock closed out the
   year losing the WCW Championship to Chris Jericho at [378]Vengeance as
   Jericho became the [379]Undisputed WWF Champion.^[380][85]

   In early 2002, Rock feuded with Jericho and challenged him for the
   Undisputed Championship at [381]Royal Rumble, but lost the
   match.^[382][86] After losing to Jericho, Rock engaged in feuds and
   wrestled the likes of The Undertaker at [383]No Way Out and
   [384]Hollywood Hulk Hogan at [385]WrestleMania X8.^[386][87]^[387][88]
   On July 21, The Rock won his record-breaking seventh and final WWE
   Championship, which was then under the name "WWE Undisputed
   Championship".^[388][89] He defeated Kurt Angle and The Undertaker in a
   match at [389]Vengeance, after he hit the [390]Rock Bottom on
   Angle.^[391][89]^[392][90] The Rock successfully defended the title at
   Global Warning against [393]Triple H and [394]Brock Lesnar by
   [395]pinning Triple H, who then saved The Rock after Lesnar tried to
   ambush him after the match.^[396][91] Johnson finally [397]dropped the
   WWE Undisputed Championship to Lesnar at [398]SummerSlam, ending his
   final championship reign.^[399][92]

[[400]edit] Final heel turn (2003)

   The Rock's last heel turn began on [401]SmackDown! in January 2003,
   where he publicly criticized Hulk Hogan.^[402][93] Their WrestleMania
   X8 rematch at [403]No Way Out ended with The Rock claiming victory
   again, with assistance from Vince McMahon and [404]Sylvain
   Grenier.^[405][62]^[406][73] The Rock later drafted himself to Raw and
   started a feud with [407]The Hurricane and other babyfaces.^[408][94]
   He also had a comical [409]gimmick, where he played the guitar and sang
   songs mocking the host city for the event, which culminated in a "Rock
   concert" that took place during the main event of the March 24, 2003
   edition of Raw, where The Rock mocked host city [410]Sacramento because
   of the [411]Sacramento Kings' inability to beat the [412]Los Angeles
   Lakers.^[413][95] After putting down the city of Sacramento and singing
   about how he intended to leave as soon as possible, he concluded the
   song with, "I'll be sure to come back when the Lakers beat the Kings in
   May!".^[414][95]

   When Stone Cold Steve Austin returned, they once again [415]feuded, and
   The Rock defeated Austin at [416]WrestleMania XIX, which was Austin's
   last major appearance in a wrestling role.^[417][62]^[418][96] The Rock
   then had a feud with former [419]World Championship Wrestling star
   [420]Bill Goldberg, to whom Rock lost at
   [421]Backlash.^[422][62]^[423][97] The Rock then turned face once more
   by engaging in a one night feud against Chris Jericho and then-heel,
   [424]Christian.^[425][98] During his previous heel turn, he had
   declared Christian as his favorite wrestler, leading Christian to begin
   calling himself the "new people's champion" and referring to his fans
   as "his peeps."^[426][98]^[427][99]

[[428]edit] Sporadic appearances (20042008)

   The Rock made occasional wrestling appearances up to 2004's
   [429]WrestleMania XX, when the storyline revolving around [430]Mick
   Foley had him brought back to help in his feud with [431]Evolution
   ([432]Ric Flair, [433]Randy Orton and [434]Batista).^[435][3] One
   humorous in-ring segment involved The Rock hosting his own version of
   "This Is Your Life" for Foley on the March 8, 2004 edition of
   Raw.^[436][62]^[437][100] Rock reunited with Foley after five years, as
   Rock 'n' Sock Connection and the duo went on to lose to Orton, Flair
   and Batista at [438]WrestleMania XX in a [439]handicap match when Orton
   pinned Foley with an RKO.^[440][62]^[441][101] As of 2009, this was
   Rock's last match.^[442][62]

   He made sporadic appearances in WWE following WrestleMania, including
   standing up for [443]Eugene, making a cameo appearance in his home-town
   of Miami and helping Foley turn back [444]La Rsistance.^[445][15] He
   hosted a "Pie-Eating Contest" during the [446]Diva Search 2004 and
   ended the segment by giving [447]Jonathan Coachman a Rock Bottom and a
   People's Elbow.^[448][15] After this appearance, Johnson reported in
   several interviews that he was no longer under contract with
   WWE.^[449][15] He also reported that the reason he was able to continue
   using the name "The Rock" was part of a dual ownership between him and
   WWE.^[450][102]

   On March 12, 2007, The Rock made an appearance on WWE after a near
   three year absence, appearing on Raw via a pre-taped segment on the
   titantron. He correctly "predicted" that [451]Bobby Lashley would
   defeat [452]Umaga at [453]WrestleMania 23 in [454]Donald Trump and
   Vince McMahon's "Battle of the Billionaires" match.^[455][103]

   On March 29, 2008, The Rock inducted his father, [456]Rocky Johnson,
   and his grandfather, [457]Peter Maivia into the [458]WWE Hall of Fame.
   During his induction speech he [459]roasted WWE superstars such as
   [460]Santino Marella, [461]John Cena, [462]Chris Jericho, [463]Mick
   Foley, and Steve Austin.^[464][104]

[[574]edit] Television and movie career

   Dwayne Johnson photographed by [575]Jerry Avenaim for [576]Vanity Fair
   in 2001

   The success of Johnson's in-ring character allowed him to cross over
   into mainstream popularity, and he appeared on [577]Wyclef Jean's 2000
   single "[578]It Doesn't Matter" and the accompanying
   video.^[579][117]^[580][118] That same year, he hosted [581]Saturday
   Night Live.^[582][119] Fellow wrestlers [583]Triple H, [584]The Big
   Show, and [585]Mick Foley appeared on the show.^[586][3]^[587][120]
   According to Johnson, it was due to the success of that episode that he
   began receiving offers from Hollywood studios.^[588][121]

   He filmed guest roles on [589]Star Trek: Voyager and [590]That '70s
   Show where he played his father, [591]Rocky Johnson. His motion picture
   debut was a brief appearance as [592]The Scorpion King in the opening
   of [593]The Mummy Returns.^[594][3]^[595][119] The film's financial
   success led to his first leading role starring in the follow-up,
   [596]The Scorpion King.^[597][3] He was considered for the lead in a
   feature-length [598]Johnny Bravo film, but it was canceled during
   production.^[599][7]

   Since his last WWE match in 2004, he has quit wrestling and focused
   solely on acting.^[600][122] He also continued to make television
   appearances, including [601]Disney Channel's hit show [602]Cory in the
   House, in the episode entitled Never the Dwayne Shall Meet.^[603][123]
   Though Johnson is no longer active with WWE, the company continues to
   sell "The Rock" merchandise, and Johnson continues to be featured
   prominently in the opening montages of their television
   programming.^[604][7] The Rock has continued to show a multitude of his
   acting/talent skills including movie roles like the cocky famous
   football player Joe Kingman in [605]The Game Plan, and in [606]Get
   Smart where he played Agent 23.

   Johnson was featured in the 2007 [607]Guinness Book of World Records
   for having the highest salary as an actor in his first starring role,
   receiving [608]$5.5 million.^[609][124]^[610][125] He appeared at the
   [611]80th Academy Awards on February 24, 2008 as a presenter for the
   [612]Best Visual Effects award.^[613][126] He was nominated for
   Favorite Movie Actor at Nickelodeon's 2008 [614]Kids' Choice Awards for
   his role in [615]The Game Plan, but lost out to [616]Johnny Depp, who
   won for his performance in [617]Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's
   End.^[618][127]^[619][128].

   Dwayne Johnson is scheduled to host the 2009 [620]Kids' Choice Awards
   on March 28, 2009. Johnson is also set to appear on an episode of
   [621]Wizards of Waverly Place as part of his stint with [622]Disney.
