From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Dou Kang () (died 621), [8]courtesy name Daosheng (), was an official
   and general during the [9]Chinese dynasties [10]Sui Dynasty and
   [11]Tang Dynasty who briefly served as a [12]chancellor early in the
   reign of [13]Emperor Gaozu of Tang.

[[18]edit] Background

   It is not known when Dou Kang was born. His father was Dou Rongding
   (),^[19][1] who carried the Sui title of Duke of Chen. His mother was
   the Princess Ancheng, sister to Sui Dynasty's founder [20]Emperor Wen.
   As the emperor's nephew, Dou Kang was treated well by Emperor Wen, and
   was a student at the imperial university in his youth. He also became a
   guard for Emperor Wen.

[[21]edit] During Sui Dynasty

   After Dou Rongding died in 586, Dou Kang inherited the title of Duke of
   Chen. He was then made the governor of Liang Province (, roughly modern
   [22]Hanzhong, [23]Shaanxi). Before his departing the capital
   [24]Chang'an to report to Liang Province, Emperor Wen personally
   visited Dou Kang and Princess Ancheng. Later, when Princess Ancheng
   died, Dou Kang was said to be in much distress in mourning that he
   fainted several times, and Emperor Wen sent his servants to comfort Dou
   Kang. Thereafter, Emperor Wen recalled him to governmental service as
   the governor of Qi Province (, roughly modern [25]Baoji, [26]Shaanxi),
   and then as the commandant at You Province (, roughly modern
   [27]Beijing). Dou developed a reputation for being generous and
   merciful, during these terms of service.

   In 604, Emperor Wen died -- a death that traditional historians
   generally believe to be a murder ordered by his son and [28]crown
   prince [29]Yang Guang, although they admitted a lack of direct
   evidence. Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. Immediately
   thereafter, another son of Emperor Wen, [30]Yang Liang the Prince of
   Han, rebelled against Emperor Yang at Bing Province (, roughly modern
   [31]Taiyuan, [32]Shanxi). Emperor Yang, for reasons not stated in
   historical accounts, suspected Dou of collaborating with Yang Liang and
   sent the general Li Zixiong () rushing to You Province to arrest Dou
   and replace him. Li subsequently alleged that Dou had received letters
   from Yang Liang urging him to join the rebellion but had not reported
   them to Emperor Yang. However, after an investigation, Emperor Yang
   concluded that there was a lack of evidence that Dou collaborated with
   Yang Liang, but nevertheless removed him from governmental service and
   further stripped him of the title of Duke of Chen, bestowing that title
   on his younger brother Dou Qing () instead.

   Dou Kang was friendly with another general, [33]Li Yuan the Duke of
   Tang, the husband of a cousin of his. During the rebellion of the
   general [34]Yang Xuangan in 613, when Li Yuan was commissioned with an
   army, it was said that Dou told Li,

          Is it not that Yang Xuangan is providing you with an
          opportunity? The prophecies refer to the Li clan as the
          originator of the next emperor, and you can use this
          opportunity. This is a divine revelation.

   Li responded, "I will not be the start of a rebellion. Why do you speak
   in such daring terms?" Nevertheless, he kept Dou's suggestion in mind.

   Toward the end of Emperor Yang's reign, Dou was commissioned with an
   army at [35]Lingwu to secure the northern border. After Li Yuan
   rebelled against Emperor Yang in 617 and subsequently captured
   Chang'an, declaring Emperor Yang's grandson [36]Yang You the Prince of
   Dai emperor (as Emperor Gong), Dou submitted to him in spring 618,
   along with the several commanderies he controlled in the region.

[[37]edit] During Tang Dynasty

   Soon thereafter, Emperor Yang was killed in a coup at Jiangdu (, in
   modern [38]Yangzhou, [39]Jiangsu) led by the general [40]Yuwen Huaji.
   When the news reached Chang'an, Li Yuan had Emperor Gong yield the
   throne to him, establishing [41]Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. Dou
   Kang, who was then the minister of engineering, was given the
   additional title of Nayan (), the head of the examination bureau of the
   government and a post considered to be one for a [42]chancellor. He
   often attended Emperor Gaozu in the palace. Emperor Gaozu referred to
   him as "brother," and within the palace, he was referred to as "uncle."

   In winter 618, Dou Kang was no longer Nayan, and was made a general. He
   soon assisted Emperor Gaozu's son [43]Li Shimin the Prince of Qin in
   defeating a major enemy, [44]Xue Rengao the Emperor of Qin. In 621, he
   also assisted Li Shimin in attacking [45]Wang Shichong the Emperor of
   Zheng, and after Wang surrendered, nine officials were particularly
   honored at the imperial ancestors' temple, among them were Dou Kang and
   his cousin Dou Gui (); he was also given much material rewards. Later
   that year, during an imperial feast, Dou Kang died suddenly.

[[46]edit] Notes

    1. [47]^ The [48]Book of Sui refers to Dou Kang's father as Dou
       Rongding and had a full biography on Dou Rongding, but the [49]Book
       of Tang and the [50]New Book of Tang gave Dou Kang's father's name
       as just Dou Rong (). Compare Book of Sui, vol. 39[51][1] with Book
       of Tang, vol. 61[52][2] and New Book of Tang, vol. 95[53][3].
