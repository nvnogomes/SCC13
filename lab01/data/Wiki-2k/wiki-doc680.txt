[[50]edit] History

   In 1982, [51]William A. Porter and [52]Bernard A. Newcomb founded
   TradePlus Inc. in [53]Palo Alto, California. In 1991, Porter founded a
   new company, E-Trade Securities, Inc., with several hundred thousand
   dollars of startup capital from TradePlus. E-Trade offered its trading
   services via [54]America Online and [55]Compuserve. In 1994, its
   revenues neared $11 million (up from $850,000 in 1992). It later
   reorganized and emerged under the name E-Trade Group, with E-Trade
   Securities as its principal subsidiary.^[56][3]

   In August 1996, it went public with [57]Robertson, Stephens & Company
   as the lead underwriter. In 2003, the company changed its name from
   E-Trade Group Inc. to E-Trade Financial Corporation.

   In 2003, the [58]Toronto-Dominion Bank held talks to merge its [59]TD
   Waterhouse discount brokerage with E-Trade, but the two sides could not
   come to an agreement over control of the merged entity.^[60][4]^[61][5]
   In 2005, E-Trade made an unsolicited offer for [62]Ameritrade,
   currently the second largest US discount broker. Ameritrade instead
   purchased TD Waterhouse, with TD Bank holding a 39% stake in the new
   entity.^[63][6]

   In 2005, E-Trade Financial acquired [64]Harrisdirect, formerly a
   discount brokerage service of [65]Bank of Montreal, and [66]BrownCo,
   formerly a discount brokerage service of [67]J.P. Morgan.^[68][7]

[[69]edit] Divestiture of subprime portfolio

   E-Trade Financial Center, San Francisco

   On November 29, 2007, E-Trade announced a deal with the [70]Citadel
   Investment Group in which Citadel purchased E-Trade's securitized
   [71]subprime mortgage investments for $800 million, cash. The
   transaction removed the assets with the greatest market risk from
   E-Trade's consolidated [72]balance sheet -- their $3 billion
   [73]asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio, including its ABS
   [74]collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and [75]second lien
   securities. This resulted in a net $2.2 billion reduction in assets on
   their [76]balance sheet. In addition to that divestiture, under the
   terms of the deal E-Trade received $1.6 billion of capital in exchange
   for 12.5% senior unsecured notes and 84,687,686 shares [77]common stock
   (equal to 19.99% of the then currently outstanding shares). Citadel
   received a seat on E-Trade Financial's [78]Board of Directors.
   [79]Mitch Caplan resigned as CEO on the same day that the deal was
   announced.

   Although E-Trade's management admits that the deal was costly for
   E-Trade, it removed the risk from those subprime investments and
   resulted in an infusion of $2.5 billion in cash.

   Prior to the [80]subprime mortgage crisis, E-Trade's stock price had
   reached a 52-week high of $26.08 and had a [81]book value ([82]assets -
   [83]liabilities / number of [84]shares outstanding) of $9.68 per share.
   However, on or about November 12, 2007, [85]Citigroup analyst Prashant
   Bhatia suggested that E-Trade Financial could face a run on its bank
   operations and a bankruptcy filing, causing the stock to drop
   heavily.^[86][8]

   After the sell-off and the Citadel deal, E-Trade's book value was $4.53
   per share (a 52.2% drop), and the shares had reached a 52-week low of
   $3.46 per share (a 86.7% drop). Bloomberg News reported that E-Trade
   had lost between 1-2% of their deposits. Moody's reported that E-Trade
   saw a "17% drop in customer cash and deposits in the month of
   November". The company implemented a comprehensive turnaround plan at
   the end of 2007 which included an assessment of its organizational
   structure, operating expense base and balance sheet transition, along
   with a customer win-back campaign.

   In March 2008, E-Trade named Donald Layton, formerly JPMorgan Chase
   vice chairman, as its new CEO. Layton had joined E-Trade's board of
   directors in November 2007, at the same time as the Citadel deal.
   Layton has been aggressively acting on the turnaround plan and the
   company has stabilized and is seeing the beginnings of a return to
   growth.

   In July 2008, E-Trade sold its Canadian division to [87]Scotiabank for
   CAN$444 million, as part of a program of selling off non-core
   assets.^[88][9]
