Doxie Moore

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   John Doxie Moore (born February 13, 1911; died April 1986) is a former
   [8]basketball player and coach. He attended [9]Delphi High School in
   [10]Delphi, Indiana, and played college ball at [11]Purdue University
   from 1930-34. He coached several professional basketball teams,
   including the [12]Sheboygan Red Skins, the [13]Anderson Packers and the
   [14]Milwaukee Hawks in the 1950s.

   Moore was hired to coach Sheboygan for the 1946-47 season. The Red
   Skins finished with a 26-18 record and qualified for the National
   Basketball League playoffs, where they were ousted in the first round.
   In 1947-48, Moore began the season as Sheboygan's head coach, but gave
   up the duties when the Red Skins obtained player-coach Bobby McDermott,
   a Hall of Fame guard, from the Chicago American Gears. The Gears
   players had been distributed among the NBL's teams when Chicago's
   league, the fledgling Professional Basketball League of America, folded
   in November 1947 after only three weeks in operation. McDermott coached
   Sheboygan to a 4-5 record in one month of duty before leaving for the
   Tri-Cities Blackhawks and handing the reins back to Moore. The Red
   Skins finished a disappointing 23-37 and missed the playoffs.

   He also served as commissioner of the [15]National Professional
   Basketball League, which struggled to finish its only season.

   In the 1950s, Moore was an administrative assistant to Indiana Governor
   [16]George N. Craig.

   Moore was inducted into the [17]Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in
   1978.
