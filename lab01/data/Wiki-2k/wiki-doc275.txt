   A [14]cylinder head sliced in half shows two overhead camshaftsone
   above each of the two [15]valves.

   Overhead camshaft, commonly abbreviated to OHC, [16]valvetrain
   configurations place the engine [17]camshaft within the [18]cylinder
   heads, above the [19]combustion chambers, and drive the [20]valves or
   [21]lifters in a more direct manner compared to [22]overhead valves
   (OHV) and [23]pushrods.

   Compared to OHV pushrod (or I-Head) systems with the same number of
   valves the reciprocating components of the OHC system are fewer and
   have a lower total mass. Though the system that drives the cams may
   become more complex, most engine manufacturers easily accept that added
   complexity in trade for better engine performance and greater design
   flexibility. Another performance advantage is gained as a result of the
   better optimized port configurations made possible with overhead
   camshaft designs. With no intrusive pushrods the overhead camshaft
   cylinder head design can use straighter ports of more advantageous
   crossection and length.

   The OHC system can be driven using the same methods as an OHV system,
   which include using a rubber/kevlar toothed [24]timing belt, [25]chain,
   or in less common cases, [26]gears.

   Many OHC engines today employ [27]variable valve timing and
   [28]multiple valves to improve efficiency and power. OHC also
   inherently allows for greater engine speeds over comparable
   cam-in-block designs.

   There are two overhead camshaft layouts:
     * Single overhead camshaft - or SOHC
     * Dual overhead camshaft - or DOHC

[[35]edit] Single overhead camshaft

   A single overhead camshaft cylinder head from a 1987 [36]Honda [37]CRX
   Si.

   Single overhead camshaft (SOHC) is a design in which one camshaft is
   placed within the [38]cylinder head. In an inline engine this means
   there is one camshaft in the head, while in a [39]V engine or a
   horizontally-opposed engine (boxer; [40]flat engine) there are two
   camshafts: one per cylinder bank.

   The SOHC design has less reciprocating mass than a comparable
   [41]pushrod design. This allows for higher engine speeds, which in turn
   will increase power output for a given [42]torque. The cam operates the
   valves directly or through a [43]rocker arm, as opposed to overhead
   valve [44]pushrod engines which have tappets, long pushrods, and rocker
   arms to transfer the movement of the lobes on the camshaft in the
   engine block to the valves in the [45]cylinder head.

   SOHC designs offer reduced complexity compared to [46]pushrod designs
   when used for multi-valve heads in which each cylinder has more than
   two valves. An example of a SOHC design using [47]shim and bucket valve
   adjustment was the engine installed in the [48]Hillman Imp (4 cylinder,
   8 valve); a small, early 1960s 2-door [49]saloon car with a rear
   mounted alloy engine based on the [50]Coventry Climax FWMA race
   engines. Exhaust and inlet manifolds were both on the same side of the
   engine block (thus not a [51]crossflow cylinder head design). This did,
   however, offer excellent access to the spark plugs.

   In the early 1980s, [52]Toyota and [53]Volkswagen also used a directly
   actuated, SOHC parallel valve configuration with two valves for each
   cylinder. The Toyota system used hydraulic [54]tappets while the
   Volkswagen system used bucket [55]tappets with shims for valve lash
   adjustment. Of all valvetrain systems, this is the least complex
   configuration possible.

[[56]edit] Dual overhead camshaft

   sprockets.

   A double overhead camshaft valve train layout is characterized by two
   camshafts located within the cylinder head, one operating the inlet
   valves and one operating the exhaust valves. Some engines have more
   than one bank of cylinder heads (V8 and [58]flat-four being two
   well-known examples) and these have more than two camshafts in total,
   but they remain DOHC. The term "twin cam" is imprecise, but will
   normally refer to DOHC eng valves, but are necessary for more than two
   valves that are directly actuated (though still usually via tappets).
   Not all DOHC engines are multivalve enginesDOHC was common in two valve
   per cylinder heads for decades before multivalve heads appeared. Today,
   however, DOHC is synonymous with multi-valve heads since almost all
   DOHC engines have between three and five valves per cylinder.^[59][1]

[[60]edit] History

   [61]DOHC [62]straight-8 in a 1933 [63]Bugatti Type 59 [64]Grand Prix
   racer

   Among the early pioneers of DOHC were [65]Isotta Fraschini's
   [66]Giustino Cattaneo, [67]Austro-Daimler's [68]Ferdinand Porsche
   [69]Stephen Tomczak (in the Prinz Heinrich), and [70]W. O. Bentley (in
   1919); [71]Sunbeam built small numbers between 1921 and 1923.^[72][2]
   The first DOHC engines were two- or four-valve per cylinder designs
   from companies like [73]Fiat (1912), [74]Peugeot Grand Prix (1913, 4
   valve), [75]Alfa Romeo [76]GP (1914, 4 valve) and [77]6C (1925),
   [78]Maserati [79]Tipo 26 (1926), [80]Bugatti [81]Type 51 (1931), and
   [82]Audi^[[83]clarification needed]. Most [84]Ferraris used two-valve
   DOHC engines as well.

   When DOHC technology was introduced in mainstream vehicles, it was
   common for it to be heavily advertised. While used at first in limited
   production and sports cars, [85]Fiat is credited as the first car
   company to use a belt-driven DOHC engine across their complete product
   line, in the mid-1960s.^[[86]citation needed], although [87]Jaguar's
   XK6 DOHC engine was displayed in the Jaguar XK120 at the London Motor
   Show in 1948 and used across the whole Jaguar range through the late
   1940s, 1950 and 1960s.

   More than two overhead camshafts are not known to have been tried in a
   production engine. However [88]MotoCzysz has designed a motorcycle
   engine with a triple overhead camshaft configuration with the intake
   ports descending through the head to two central intake ports between
   two outside exhaust camshafts actuating one of two exhaust valve per
   cylinder each. ^[89][3]
