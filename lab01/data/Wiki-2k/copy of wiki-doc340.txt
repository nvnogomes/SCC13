[[32]edit] OMB Service

   President [33]George W. Bush nominated her on [34]February 28, [35]2005
   to be the Controller of OMB. The [36]United States Senate
   [37]unanimously confirmed Combs on [38]June 24, [39]2005^[40][1]
   ^[41][2].

   As Controller, Dr. Combs oversaw all of Federal financial management,
   was the head of the [42]Office of Federal Financial Management, and
   chaired the [43]U.S. Chief Financial Officers Council^[44][3]. She
   owned three initiatives of the [45]President's Management Agenda:
   improving financial performance, eliminating improper payments, and
   real property ^[46][4].

   Also, Dr. Combs oversaw Government-wide financial management policies,
   and requirements. Specifically she focused on financial results in the
   largest 24 departments and agencies in the [47]United States Federal
   Government. She oversaw about $2.47 trillion in spending each
   year.^[[48]citation needed]

   Notably, during Dr. Combs's tenure at [49]OMB, the Federal CFO
   community:

   1) For the first time in history and for the second straight year
   successfully accelerated financial reporting so that audited financial
   statements were published by ever major agency within 45 days of the
   close of the fiscal year (a pace that significantly betters private
   sector reporting and improves on past Government results when agencies
   took as long as 5 months to report);^[[50]citation needed]

   2) Obtained clean audit opinions in 19 of the 24 largest agencies for
   two straight years, and decreased the number of material weaknesses by
   more than 15% despite tougher audit standards (a major accomplishment
   from achieving only one clean audit in 1990 and only six in 1996 for
   those same 24 agencies);^[[51]citation needed]

   3) Eliminated approximately $9 billion in improper payments--a 17%
   decrease since 2004.^[[52]citation needed]

   4) Developed and reported the first ever government-wide inventory of
   the Federal real property assets, reporting data on more than 1.2
   million assets world-wide, and disposing of $3.5 billion in excess
   property since 2004.^[[53]citation needed]

[[54]edit] Early life and education

   A native of [55]Granite Falls, North Carolina, Dr. Combs earned an
   Associate of the Arts degree at [56]Gardner-Webb University, Bachelor
   of Science and Master's degrees from [57]Appalachian State University,
   and a [58]Doctorate in Educational Administration from [59]Virginia
   Polytechnic Institute and State University. She is also a graduate of
   the Program for Senior Managers in Government at [60]Harvard
   University, and holds an [61]honorary Doctorate from [62]Gardner-Webb
   University.

[[63]edit] Government service and private sector career

   Dr. Combs was previously appointed by President George W. Bush and
   confirmed by the [64]United States Senate to the position of Assistant
   Secretary for Budget and Programs and [65]Chief Financial Officer at
   the [66]U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). As Assistant
   Secretary, Dr. Combs oversaw all budgetary and management functions of
   the Department, including budget development and budget execution. As
   [67]Chief Financial Officer, she was responsible for oversight of the
   Departments $57 billion appropriation, the Government Performance and
   Results Act, as well as general monitoring of programs.

   Prior to her appointment at DOT, Dr. Combs held a Presidential
   Appointment, confirmed by the Senate, at the [68]United States
   Environmental Protection Agency, where she served as Chief Financial
   Officer from 2001 2003 ^[69][5].

   During the previous Reagan and Bush Administrations, Dr. Combs served
   in various oversight roles and executive level management positions at
   the [70]U.S. Department of Education, [71]U.S. Department of Veterans
   Affairs, and [72]U.S. Department of the Treasury.

   Prior to government service, and following a successful career of over
   ten years in instructional and administrative positions in the
   [73]Winston-Salem/[74]Forsyth County School System, she was elected in
   1980 to the Board of Education in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County, North
   Carolina. In 1986 she was appointed as Education Advisor to the
   [75]Governor of North Carolina, [76]James G. Martin.

   Dr. Combs has also spent a number of years in the private sector. In
   her role of Operations Officer and Manager of National Direct Student
   Loans for [77]Wachovia Corporation, Dr. Combs was responsible for the
   general management of National Direct Student Loan Operations, with an
   expense budget that affected several million dollars of annual revenue.
   For ten years, Dr. Combs and her husband founded and grew their own
   highly successful private record label and music catalog company to
   achieve worldwide distribution of CDs, videos, and music books. She is
   also a published author on family caregiving, and was a national
   spokesperson for [78]Warner Lambert Pharmaceutical Company.

   Before returning to the federal government in 2001, Dr. Combs was a
   member of the Board of Visitors of the [79]Babcock Graduate School of
   Management at [80]Wake Forest University, Chair of the Board of
   Directors of the Appalachian State University Foundation, and a member
   of the Board of Trustees at [81]Gardner-Webb University. She also
   served on several corporate boards.

[[82]edit] Published author

   After her mother's medical verdict of increasing memory loss was
   pronounced, Linda Combs resigned her executive post in Washington,
   D.C., and moved home to North Carolina.

   Her familiarity with [83]Alzheimer's prompted Linda Combs to write her
   book, A Long Goodbye and Beyond, as a resource for other parental
   caregivers, like herself, who must assist a loved one to pass through
   the stages of unlovely deterioration^[84][6].
