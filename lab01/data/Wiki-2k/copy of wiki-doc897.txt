   Edna Pettie, known as Edna May, was an American actress and singer. She
   was born on [13]September 2, [14]1878 in [15]Syracuse, New York, and
   died [16]January 1, [17]1948 in [18]Lausanne, [19]Switzerland.

[[20]edit] Life and career

   At the age of 5, May played Little Willie Allen in a production of
   "Dora". By the age of 7, she had joined a children's opera company and
   performed [21]Gilbert and Sullivan productions in Syracuse. She studied
   music at the New York Conservatoire and made her professional debut in
   1895 in Si Stebbings in Syracuse. She then moved to New York to join
   the chorus of an [22]Oscar Hammerstein production of Santa Maria. That
   year, she married Fred Titus, who held a world record for cycling. They
   divorced in 1904.

   In 1897, May played Violet Grey in [23]The Belle of New York with only
   moderate success. The following year the production played in London,
   becoming a hit and running for 697 performances, making May a star.
   After that, among others, she played Gabrielle Dalmonte in [24]An
   American Beauty in London (1900), Olga in The Girl from Up There (1901)
   in New York and then London, Edna Branscombe in [25]Three Little Maids
   (1902), Lillian Leigh in [26]The School Girl (1903-1914) in London and
   New York, Alesia in [27]La Poupe (1904) in London, and Angela in
   [28]The Catch of the Season (1905) in New York. [29]The Belle of
   Mayfair followed in London in 1906. May played the title character in
   Nelly Neil in London in 1907.

   May was known for her beauty and received tremendous attention from
   male admirers. She was involved in a passionate but failed relationship
   with Prince Raj Narayan Bahadur(of the erstwhile kingdom of Cooch Behar
   in India) but could not marry him due to his parent's disapproval as
   she did not belong to one of India's royal families. Finally, in 1907,
   she agreed to marry millionaire Oscar Lewisohn and retired from the
   stage. The couple settled in England.

   May lived at [30]Winkfield in [31]Berkshire during her retirement, but
   made brief returns to the stage in 1911 benefit performances of The
   Belle of New York at the [32]Savoy Theatre in London and 1915's The
   Masque of Peace and War in London. Also in 1911, she appeared in the
   film Forgotten; or An Answered Prayer. She also starred in a 1916 film
   version of The Belle of New York called Salvation Joan.
