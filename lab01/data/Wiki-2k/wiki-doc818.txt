Ecorse River

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search
   The north branch at Council Point Park in [8]Lincoln Park.

   The Ecorse River is a small [9]river in southern [10]Michigan. Because
   of its small size, it is often identified as Ecorse Creek. It flows
   through the [11]Downriver section of [12]Metro Detroit, and is a
   tributary of the [13]Detroit River. The early French settlers named it
   the Rivire aux corces, meaning the "bark river". The river was given
   this name because of a custom, of the local [14]Native American tribe,
   of wrapping its dead in [15]birch or [16]elm [17]bark, and burying them
   at the mouth of the river. [18]City of Wyandotte The river has two
   branches, which meet at Council Point Park in the city of [19]Lincoln
   Park, where [20]Chief Pontiac once held a council in 1763 before
   attacking [21]Fort Detroit.

[[27]edit] Description

   The river system consists of a 13 mi (21 km) long South Branch,
   including the Sexton-Kilfoil Drain, and a 16 mi (26 km) long North
   Branch which combine and run another 0.5 miles (0.8 km). Elevations run
   from 670 feet (204 m) in the northwest corner of the [28]watershed to
   575 feet (174 m) at the Detroit River. Over a year, it has a mean flow
   of 3.2 cubic feet (0.091 m^3) per second. The Ecorse River has a
   watershed of 43.4 square miles (112 km). The north branch drains 18.75
   [29]sq mi (48.6 km) and has tributaries designated the Trouton Drain,
   Freeman Drain, Black Creek, and the Douglas and Kelly Drain. The north
   branch flows within The south branch has a drainage area of 12 sq mi
   (31 km) and tributaries include the Grams Drain in Southgate, and the
   Brighton, Bondie, and the Sloss and Ganong Drains in Taylor. The rest
   of the watershed is drained by enclosed underground drains; the largest
   of which is the La Blanc Drain which enters the north branch about 500
   feet (152 m) north of the junction of the north and south branches. The
   La Blanc Drain drains 12 square miles (31 km).

   The north branch flows through [30]Romulus, [31]Dearborn Heights,
   [32]Allen Park, along a small portion of the southern border of
   [33]Melvindale, Lincoln Park and then along the border of Lincoln Park
   and [34]Ecorse. The south branch flows through Romulus, [35]Taylor,
   Allen Park and Lincoln Park. It is joined by the Sexton and Kilfoil
   Drain in Taylor. After the two branches join in Lincoln Park, the river
   flows along the boundary between Ecorse and [36]Wyandotte to its mouth
   on the [37]Detroit River. A marina occupies both banks of the river at
   its mouth.

   The river has a very low gradient and is subject to heavy silting which
   worsens the seasonal flooding. Much of the watershed contains [38]clay
   soil 20 to 65 feet (6 to 20 m) deep which limits ground absorption and
   85% of the land in the entire watershed is developed as residential or
   commercial/industrial which decreases the available land surface for
   absorption. Homes near the river are required to carry [39]flood
   insurance and damaging flooding is a common occurrence. A storm on
   [40]May 21, [41]2004 that produced four inches (10 cm) of rain resulted
   in the river rising over six feet (1.8 m) in only three hours.

   The Ecorse River flows into the Detroit River about midway along that
   river's course. The next river north of the Ecorse is the [42]Rouge
   River while the next river south is the [43]Huron River.

   The watershed is heavily developed, with a population density of 3,711
   people per square mile in 2000. It is also heavily industrialized with
   both light and heavy industry. Contamination is a problem, both from
   ongoing industrial and residential sources and as a legacy of the steel
   works along its lower length.

[[44]edit] Flood Control

   It was reported in September [45]2008 that the Wayne County Department
   of Environment will begin the first phase of a $239 million project,to
   protect the nine municipalities along the north branch of the creek
   from [46]flash flooding.^[47][1] The first phase, to begin in early
   [48]2009, is to cost $7 to $10 million and will be funded by special
   assessments on the 48,000 properties in the [49]watershed. It will
   consist of changes to the 80 paths that cross the creek, as well as
   constructing new drains and basins.

[[50]edit] Note

   Some sources designate the North and South branches as Ecorse Creek and
   only short combined stream as Ecorse River.
