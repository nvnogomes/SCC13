[[38]edit] Club career

   Bulykin began his football career with [39]Lokomotiv Moscow in 1997. He
   stayed with Lokomotiv for three years scoring 18 goals in 68
   appearances and attracted quite a bit of attention. One of the
   notorious moments at the time was his physical encounter with a tough
   and feared defender [40]Gorlukovich. Bulykin was forced to leave
   Lokomotiv after falling out with manager [41]Yuri Semin. He signed with
   [42]Dynamo Moscow in 2000 and quickly established himself as the first
   team player for the next three seasons. He scored a total of 27 goals
   in 145 appearances for the club.

   With improving performances for both club and country, Bulykin, who had
   never hidden his desire to move to a foreign club, was expected to move
   abroad. In January 2004 he spent two weeks on trial with [43]Everton,
   but the club decided against signing the player.^[44][1] A year later,
   in hope to finally seal his long-awaited move to [45]England, Bulykin
   went on trials with several [46]Premier League clubs in a row,
   including [47]Bolton Wanderers and [48]Crystal Palace, but, just like a
   year before, no deal was ever reached. A month later, [49]Portsmouth
   were reportedly interested in the player's services but that transfer
   didn't happen either.^[50][2] As a result, Bulykin remained with
   Dynamo, and was quickly relegated to play in the second team, and
   eventually excluded from training process altogether.

   While almost breaking his relationship with Dynamo, he re-signed for
   the 2006 season, after the former Russia manager [51]Yuri Semin was
   appointed as the club's manager. Semin, however, was quickly sacked and
   under the next manager, [52]Andrei Kobelev, Bulykin was placed on the
   transfer list, where he spent the rest of 2006. After Yartsev took over
   [53]Torpedo Moscow, the former Premier League team from Moscow that
   left the top Russian football league for the first time since 1933,
   Bulykin was rumoured to have been offered a place on the club's
   roster.^[54][3] On 30 January 2007, Russian online sports edition,
   sports.ru, noted that Torpedo were not interested either. Trying to
   resolve Bulykin's deadlock with Dynamo, its general manager, Dmitri
   Ivanov, stated that the club would release Bulykin with no transfer
   cost, should there be any interest from anyone.^[55][4]

   On 28 August 2007, Bulykin secured a 1-year contract with German club
   [56]Bayer Leverkusen, after scoring a goal in two friendly matches
   during his trial for the [57]Bundesliga club.^[58][5]^[59][6] On 19
   December 2007 he scored for the first time for the club, netting two
   goals against [60]Zurich in the UEFA Cup, and was declared "man of the
   match" by UEFA.

   In Round 20, Bulykin started for the first time in Bayer, but suffered
   an injury and was on the injured list for a month.

   On 19 August 2008 he moved to [61]Belgian club [62]Anderlecht, hoping
   to gain more game time as a striker. After initial success where he
   scored two headers in his debut in the Belgian Pro League, he was
   quickly benched by the coach Aril Jacobs and had marginal appearances
   through the rest of 2008.

[[63]edit] International career

   Bulykin made his debut for [64]Russia on 9 September 2003 in the
   [65]Euro 2004 qualifier against the [66]Republic of Ireland under
   manager [67]Georgi Yartsev. He made quite an impression in his only
   second appearance by scoring three goals in Russia's next qualifier
   against [68]Switzerland. Russia eventually won 4-1 to subsequently
   qualify for the [69]final tournament.

   In the final tournament Bulykin struggled in Russia's two losses
   against Spain and Portugal. Bulykin finally made an impact against
   Greece by scoring a header off a [70]Rolan Gusev corner in a game where
   Russia emerged victorious 2-1 to console their fans being the only team
   able to beat the eventual champions.

   Bulykin was called up for the [71]2006 World Cup qualifiers and scored
   in the very first round against Slovakia in a 1-1 draw. When [72]Georgi
   Yartsev resigned after a disappointing 1-1 draw with Estonia, Bulykin
   lost his place in the national team.

[[73]edit] Famous quotes regarding Bulykin

     * "Bulykin usually scores in April." - ([74]Aleksandr Borodyuk,
       Russia national team manager)^[75][7]
     * "I have 3 offers. One from Torpedo, and 2 more they don't want to
       tell me about." - (D.Bulykin himself)^[76][8]
     * "Dmitry confessed once that he learned English hoping to play in
       England one day." - ([77]Yuri Zavarzin, former owner of FC
       Dynamo)^[78][9]
     * "They (Dynamo) won't let me play, but they won't let me change
       teams either. There were offers from other teams, but Dynamo did
       not find them satisfactory. They told me I'm an expensive player."
       - (D.Bulykin in his interview to Sport-Express)^[79][10]
     * "Everything is tres-chique in my life now. I've adapted, set up the
       house, moved the family in. Sometimes my wife visits me. The only
       thing left is to start playing football... but this hasn't worked
       out so far" (Bulykin, about his move to FC Anderlecht)^[80][11]
     * "I don't HAVE to run, especially because it's hard for a striker
       with my complexion" ^[81][12]
     * "I don't want to play with children. Nothing good will come out of
       it" (Bulykin on training with the youth squad of Anderlecht instead
       to stay in shape after being dropped from the Aril Jacobs team)
       ^[82][13]

[[83]edit] Trivia

   [84]Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please
   [85]relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or
   articles. (December 2007)
     * When [86]Pel visited Moscow in 2003, Bulykin emerged from the crowd
       of fans, and presented his own Dynamo jersey #10 to the football's
       great. ^[87][14]
     * Playing as the lone striker in FC Dynamo for most of the 2004,
       Bulykin scored one goal in the entire 2004 season of the Russian
       Premier League championship. This happened in April.
     * The famous story and subsequent jokes about Bulykin and his mittens
       ([88]Russian: ) originated during one of the bad games for Dynamo,
       played on a chilly day, when the then-coach [89]Yuri Semin shouted
       at Bulykin in front of the TV cameras: "Mittens! Take off the
       mittens!" This moment was televised and replayed nation-wide.
       ^[90][15]
     * In the 20th round of 2008 Bundesliga Championship, Bulykin,
       starting for the first time in his Bayer career, broke the
       Bundesliga record for the fastest yellow card received (on 12th
       second).
