   Econometrics is concerned with the tasks of developing and applying
   [97]quantitative or [98]statistical methods to the study and
   elucidation of economic principles.^[99][1] Econometrics combines
   [100]economic theory with [101]statistics to analyze and test economic
   relationships. Theoretical econometrics considers questions about the
   statistical properties of estimators and tests, while applied
   econometrics is concerned with the application of econometric methods
   to assess economic theories. Although the first known use of the term
   "econometrics" was by Pawel Ciompa in 1910, [102]Ragnar Frisch is given
   credit for coining the term in the sense that it is used
   today.^[103][2]

   Although many econometric methods represent applications of standard
   [104]statistical models, there are some special features of
   [105]economic data that distinguish econometrics from other branches of
   statistics. Economic data are generally [106]observational, rather than
   being derived from [107]controlled experiments. Because the individual
   units in an economy interact with each other, the observed data tend to
   reflect complex [108]economic equilibrium conditions rather than simple
   behavioral relationships based on [109]preferences or [110]technology.
   Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for
   [111]identification and [112]estimation of [113]simultaneous equation
   models. These methods allow researchers to make causal inferences in
   the absence of controlled experiments. Early work in econometrics
   focused on [114]time-series data, but now econometrics also fully
   covers [115]cross-sectional and [116]panel data.

[[127]edit] Purpose

   The two main purposes of econometrics are to give [128]empirical
   content to economic theory and to subject economic theory to
   potentially falsifying tests.^[129][2]

   For example, consider one of the basic relationships in economics: the
   relationship between the price of a commodity and the quantities of
   that commodity that people wish to purchase at each price (the
   [130]demand relationship). According to economic theory, an increase in
   the price would lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded, holding
   other relevant variables constant to isolate the relationship of
   interest. A mathematical equation can be written that describes the
   relationship between quantity, price, other demand variables like
   income, and a random term to reflect simplification and imprecision of
   the theoretical model:

          Q = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Price} + \beta_2\text{Income} +
          \varepsilon.

   [131]Regression analysis could be used to estimate the unknown
   parameters [0], [1], and [2] in the relationship, using data on price,
   income, and quantity. The model could then be tested for
   [132]statistical significance as to whether an increase in price is
   associated with a decrease in the quantity, as [133]hypothesized: [1] <
   0.

   There are complications even in this simple example, and it is often
   easy to mistake statistical significance with economic significance.
   Statistical significance is neither necessary nor sufficient for
   economic significance.^[134][3] In order to estimate the theoretical
   demand relationship, the observations in the data set must be price and
   quantity pairs that are collected along a demand schedule that is
   stable. If those assumptions are not satisfied, a more sophisticated
   model or econometric method may be necessary to derive reliable
   estimates and tests.

[[135]edit] Methods

   One of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is
   [136]regression analysis. For an overview of a linear implementation of
   this framework, see [137]linear regression. Regression methods are
   important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use
   [138]controlled experiments. Econometricians often seek illuminating
   [139]natural experiments in the absence of evidence from controlled
   experiments. Observational data may be subject to [140]omitted-variable
   bias and a list of other problems that must be addressed using causal
   analysis of simultaneous equation models.^[141][4]

   [142]Data sets to which econometric analyses are applied can be
   classified as [143]time-series data, [144]cross-sectional data,
   [145]panel data, and [146]multidimensional panel data. Time-series data
   sets contain observations over time; for example, inflation over the
   course of several years. Cross-sectional data sets contain observations
   at a single point in time; for example, many individuals' incomes in a
   given year. Panel data sets contain both time-series and
   cross-sectional observations. Multi-dimensional panel data sets contain
   observations across time, cross-sectionally, and across some third
   dimension. For example, the Survey of Professional Forecasters contains
   forecasts for many forecasters (cross-sectional observations), at many
   points in time (time series observations), and at multiple forecast
   horizons (a third dimension).

   Econometric analysis may also be classified on the basis of the number
   of relationships modeled. [147]Single equation methods model a single
   variable (the [148]dependent variable) as a function of one or more
   explanatory (or independent) variables. In many econometric contexts,
   such single equation methods may not recover the effect desired, or may
   produce estimates with poor statistical properties. [149]Simultaneous
   equation methods have been developed as one means of addressing these
   problems. Many of these methods use variants of [150]instrumental
   variable to make estimates.

   Other important methods include [151]Method of Moments, Generalized
   Method of Moments ([152]GMM), [153]Bayesian methods, Two Stage Least
   Squares ([154]2SLS), and Three Stage Least Squares ([155]3SLS).

[[156]edit] Example

   A simple example of a relationship in econometrics from the field of
   [157]labor economics is:

          \ln(\text{wage}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{years of education})
          + \varepsilon.

   Economic theory says that the natural logarithm of a person's wage is a
   linear function of (among other things) the number of years of
   education that person has acquired. The parameter [1] measures the
   increase in the natural log of the wage attributable to one more year
   of education. It should be noted that by using the natural log we have
   moved away from a [158]simple linear regression model and are now using
   a non linear model, in this case, a semi-log y model. The term is a
   random variable representing all other factors that may have direct
   influence on wage. The econometric goal is to estimate the parameters,
   [0] and [1] under specific assumptions about the random variable . For
   example, if is uncorrelated with years of education, then the equation
   can be estimated with [159]ordinary least squares.

   If the researcher could randomly assign people to different levels of
   education, the data set thus generated would allow estimation of the
   effect of changes in years of education on wages. In reality, those
   experiments cannot be conducted. Instead, the econometrician observes
   the years of education of and the wages paid to people who differ along
   many dimensions. Given this kind of data, the estimated coefficient on
   Years of Education in the equation above reflects both the effect of
   education on wages and the effect of other variables on wages, if those
   other variables were correlated with education. For example, people
   with more innate ability may have higher wages and higher levels of
   education. Unless the econometrician controls for innate ability in the
   above equation, the effect of innate ability on wages may be falsely
   attributed to the effect of education on wages.

   The most obvious way to control for innate ability is to include a
   measure of ability in the equation above. Exclusion of innate ability,
   together with the assumption that is uncorrelated with education
   produces a misspecified model. A second technique for dealing with
   omitted variables is [160]instrumental variables estimation. An
   overview of econometric methods used to study this problem can be found
   in Card (1999). ^[161][5]

[[162]edit] Notable econometricians

   The following are the [163]Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences
   recipients in the field of econometrics:
     * [164]Jan Tinbergen, former Professor at the [165]Erasmus University
       Rotterdam, and [166]Ragnar Frisch were awarded the first prize in
       1969 for having developed and applied dynamic models for the
       analysis of economic processes.
     * [167]Lawrence Klein, Professor of Economics at the [168]University
       of Pennsylvania, was awarded in 1980 for his computer modeling work
       in the field.
     * [169]Trygve Haavelmo was awarded in 1989. His main contribution to
       econometrics was his 1944 article (published in [170]Econometrica)
       "The Probability Approach to Econometrics."
     * [171]Daniel McFadden and [172]James Heckman shared the award in
       2000 for their work in microeconometrics. McFadden founded the
       econometrics lab at the [173]University of California, Berkeley.
     * [174]Robert Engle and [175]Clive Granger at the [176]University of
       California, San Diego, were awarded in 2003 for work on analyzing
       economic time series. Engle pioneered the method of
       [177]autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and
       Granger the method of [178]cointegration.
