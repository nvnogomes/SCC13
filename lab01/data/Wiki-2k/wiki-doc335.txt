[[58]edit] Characters

          Main article: [59]List of Darkwing Duck characters

   The main characters were:
     * [60]Darkwing Duck ([61]Jim Cummings) - Drake Mallard, average
       citizen by day and St. Canard's resident superhero by night.
     * [62]Gosalyn Mallard ([63]Christine Cavanaugh) - Drake "Darkwing
       Duck" Mallard's 9-year-old adopted daughter. Occasional crime
       fighter as "Crimson Quackette" and later as "Quiverwing Quack".
     * [64]Launchpad McQuack ([65]Terry McGovern) - Darkwing Duck's
       sidekick, originally from [66]DuckTales. He refers to Darkwing as
       "DW" and Darkwing often calls him "LP".
     * [67]Honker Muddlefoot ([68]Katie Leigh) - The Mallards' next door
       neighbour and Gosalyn's best friend.
     * [69]Herb Muddlefoot - Father of [70]Honker Muddlefoot, next door
       neighbor of Drake Mallard (Darkwing Duck). Drake finds him very
       irritating but they do work together well in at least one episode.
       Herb sells Quakerware (the Darkwing Duck universe's version of
       [71]Tupperware) as a salesman for a living.

   The success of [80]DuckTales led to a spin-off series, Darkwing Duck,
   one year after the show had ended. Darkwing Duck was inspired by two
   episodes of DuckTales, entitled [81]Double-O-Duck and [82]The Masked
   Mallard. The original concept had [83]Launchpad McQuack as the star.

   While the show establishes its own conventions, it is largely regarded
   as an affectionate satire on superhero [84]mythos and lore, some
   obvious, some subtle, and others quite witty. Darkwing's costume, gas
   gun, and flashy introductions are all direct references to pulp heroes
   such as the [85]Sandman, [86]Crimson Avenger, [87]The Green Hornet, and
   most especially [88]The Shadow.^[[89]original research?] The
   [90]fictional [91]city of [92]St. Canard, Darkwing's [93]rogues
   gallery, and the relative darkness of Darkwing as compared to other
   Disney heroes reflect [94]Batman. In addition, in the episode "Time and
   Punishment" Gosalyn is transported into a future clearly based upon
   that of Batman depicted in [95]Frank Miller's "[96]The Dark Knight
   Returns", with Darkwing having become much more hardline and strict on
   crime, wearing a suit of armour and driving a tank. As well, the
   episode Tiff of the Titans, with the mysterious Darkwing and the
   straight-arrow [97]Gizmoduck, played on the famous relationship between
   Batman and Superman. At one point in the episode, Darkwing asks, "Who
   needs super powers when you have a super mind?" while Gizmoduck remarks
   that he thinks Darkwing's crime-fighting style is "disreputable,
   disturbed, and possibly devious." In addition, there are [98]Marvel
   Universe references such as the secret intelligence organization,
   [99]S.H.U.S.H., a parody of Marvel's [100]S.H.I.E.L.D., and the episode
   Aduckyphobia shows Darkwing being bitten by a mutated spider and
   growing six arms. A few James Bond parodies exist as well, such as the
   villain Steelbeak, whose beak makes him similar to the Bond villain
   Jaws, and his personality and trappings are similar to Bond villain
   [101]Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

   Although the show only premiered in 1991, Darkwing Duck was shown in
   the [102]Disney Afternoon [103]title sequence in 1990.^[104][1]

   The character of Darkwing Duck appeared occasionally in the series
   [105]Bonkers, and earlier Gosalyn appeared in the series [106]Raw
   Toonage. In an episode of the [107]Aladdin TV series, [108]Genie
   changes his form from a French waiter into Darkwing Duck.

   Darkwing Duck and Ducktales are directly connected by two characters
   crossing over into the world of Darkwing Duck. The first is Launchpad,
   Darkwing's sidekick, who is a longtime staple of DuckTales, and
   GizmoDuck, an armored hero who became a popular part of the DuckTales
   cast during the series' run. Also, in the episode "In Like Blunt",
   DuckTales villains Flintheart Glomgold, Magica De Spell, and The Beagle
   Boys make non-speaking cameo appearances.

   The show was later referenced in a [109]Pluto cartoon on [110]Mickey
   Mouse Works as "Darkwing Dog". (The same treatment was given to
   [111]Doug (called "Brand Spanking New Dog") and Mouse Works itself
   ("Pluto's Dog Works")).

[[112]edit] Episodes

          Main article: [113]List of Darkwing Duck episodes

   Over three seasons there were a total of 91 episodes.

[[114]edit] Hot Spells controversy

   This article may contain [115]original research or [116]unverified
   claims. Please [117]improve the article by adding [118]references. See
   the [119]talk page for details. (July 2008)

   The episode Hot Spells has rarely been shown since its initial airing.
   The episode features a character named Beelzebub, who greatly resembles
   contemporary depictions of the devil. Gosalyn makes a deal with
   Beelzebub to receive magical powers in exchange for Darkwing's soul.

   That a Disney-related show had any reference to [120]Satan, and was
   even allowed to be aired, is highly unusual. The same "Devil" also
   appeared in the episode "Dead Duck," but most of that episode was
   evidently a [121]dream sequence, and the devilish character whispered
   his name into Darkwing's ear, so the viewer was unable to hear it.

[[122]edit] Broadcast history

   The two-part episode [123]Darkly Dawns the Duck originally aired as an
   hour-length TV special on [124]September 7, [125]1991 as part of a
   larger TV special, "The Darkwing Duck Premiere and Back to School With
   the Mickey Mouse Club." The film served as the show's pilot.

   Seasons 1 and 2 were aired simultaneously in the Autumn of 1991. Season
   1 on syndication as part of [126]The Disney Afternoon block of shows.
   Seasons 2 and 3 aired on Saturday mornings on [127]ABC.

   All episodes remained in syndicated reruns on The Disney Afternoon
   until 1995 and then returned to the line up from 1996 to 1997.

   The series was last seen in the U.S. on [128]Toon Disney, but due to
   bad scheduling and the addition of [129]Jetix, it has vanished
   completely from the network. Along with a number of other shows, it was
   removed from schedules in November 2004. Toon Disney aired the
   Christmas episode featuring Bushroot on [130]December 25, [131]2004.
   The show was last seen on Toon Disney in the United States on
   [132]January 19, [133]2007 as part of the [134]Toon Disney Wild Card
   Stack and was also removed from Toon Disney in [135]Scandinavia since
   September 2006.

[[136]edit] Opening Introduction

   There are six different versions of the Darkwing Duck introduction. The
   first two were aired on the Disney Channel when Darkwing Duck first
   premiered and featured alternate animation and a different version of
   the familiar theme song. The third version was used in syndication, and
   is actually the one they currently use today. The fourth is the version
   used on The Disney Afternoon, and is the same as the second version
   only cut for time. The fifth and sixth introductions were used on the
   ABC Saturday Morning airings, and contained mostly scenes from those
   episodes, starting with Darkwing tiptoeing up the Audubon Bay Bridge.

[[137]edit] Home media

   Four [138]VHS tapes, each containing two episodes of Darkwing Duck,
   were released under the title Darkwing Duck: His Favorite Adventures in
   the [139]United States on September 20, 1991: [140]Darkly Dawns the
   Duck. However, most countries around the world only received releases
   of Darkly Dawns the Duck and Justice Ducks Unite! Each video came with
   two glow-in-the-Darkwing trading cards. Featured on the cards were,
   Darkwing, Launchpad, Gosalyn, Honker, Negaduck, Bushroot, Megavolt, and
   Taurus Bulba.

   [141]Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released 3-disc DVD box set
   entitled Darkwing Duck: Volume 1 on August 29, 2006. It includes 27
   episodes, including the 2-part pilot Darkly Dawns the Duck, which was
   presented in edited form as opposed to the uncut version's release on
   VHS. The second volume, containing the next 27 episodes, was released
   on August 7, 2007.^[142][2] Unlike [143]DuckTales and [144]Chip 'n Dale
   Rescue Rangers, the episodes on the DVD's are presented in the order
   they aired. The sets do not contain any special features.
          Set Name         Ep#       Release Date
   Darkwing Duck: Volume 1 27  [145]August 26, [146]2006
   Darkwing Duck: Volume 2 27  [147]August 7, [148]2007
   Darkwing Duck: Volume 3 35  TBA

[[149]edit] Reception

   Darkwing Duck was named the 93rd best animated series by [150]IGN,
   calling it one of the many reasons why after-school cartoons
   rule.^[151][3]

[[152]edit] Video games

   There was a [153]Darkwing Duck [154]video game released by Capcom on
   the [155]Nintendo Entertainment System and the [156]Game Boy. Another
   game was also made for the [157]TurboGrafx-16.

[[158]edit] "Let's get dangerous" in other languages

   The show was dubbed in several different languages for international
   distribution. As such, the catchphrase Let's get dangerous! had to be
   translated into a similarly catchy phrase for the target language. It
   often did not keep its literal sense, as a direct translation of the
   phrase was unlikely to hold the same impact.
   Language Phrase Literal translation
   [159]Arabic ! (yalla biina nghamir!) Let's go adventure!
   [160]Cantonese Chinese ! Wait till I do some destruction!
   [161]Czech Kaer Darkwing! Darkwing Duck!

   Now we're getting dangerous!/Time to get dangerous!
   [181]Turkish Haydi, tehlikeye atlalm! Let's take a step into danger!

   His other common introductory catchphrase was, "I am the terror that
   flaps in the night!", usually followed by a somewhat strained metaphor,
   similar to the declarations of [182]Batman.
