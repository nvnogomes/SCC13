[[25]edit] Scottish Cup History

   Our Boys' first appearance in the Scottish Cup came in the 187778
   season, losing 80 away to South Western in the first round.^[26][1]
   Their first success in the Cup came the following season, with a 21 win
   at home to local rivals [27]Dundee Hibernian (later Dundee United) in
   the first round. The second round saw a 53 win at home to Balgay, with
   defeat coming in the third round, 64 away to Vale of Teith.

   In 188384 they again drew a local rival in the first round, this time
   winning 32 at home to Dundee West End. A second round 20 home win over
   Arbroath Strathmore saw them face Dundee Strathmore in the third round.
   A 22 away draw was followed by a 51 home win to secure their place in
   the fourth round for the first time. However, they lost 110 away to
   Pollokshields Athletic in the fourth round.^[28][2]

   Arbroath Strathmore were again their opponents in the first round of
   the 188485 tournament, Our Boys winning 41 away from home. They
   thrashed Dundee West End 81 in the second round and Dundee Strathmore
   51 in the third, leading to a fourth round tie at home to West Benhar.
   They drew the first game 22, but then lost the replay 83.^[29][3]

   The 188586 tournament began with an 82 away win against Coupar Angus in
   the first round. However, Our Boys lost 41 away to Dundee Harp in the
   second round to end their participation for that year.^[30][4] The
   following season was even more disappointing, a 52 defeat at home to
   [31]Forfar Athletic in the first round.^[32][5]

   The first round of the 188788 tournament saw them win 94 away to
   [33]Aberdeen. They followed this with a 53 win at home to [34]Montrose
   and a 50 win away to Fair City Athletic in the third round. They
   received a bye in the fourth round and won 42 at home to [35]Albion
   Rovers in the fifth to give them a place in the quarter-finals, where
   they lost 60 to a Cambuslang side that would go on to reach the
   final.^[36][6]

   The following season saw a 54 win at home to local rivals Dundee East
   End in the first round, a 42 home win against [37]Lochee United in the
   second and a 21 win at home to Dundee Harp in the third before an 111
   defeat away to [38]Abercorn in the fourth round.^[39][7]

   The 188990 tournament began for Our Boys with a 63 win at home to
   Strathmore. A 65 win away to Dundee Harp followed in the second round,
   before losing 32 at home to another Dundee side, East End, in the third
   round.^[40][8]

   With the advent of the Scottish Football League in 1890, the 189091 Cup
   included league and non-league sides for the first time. Our Boys beat
   fellow non-league side [41]Forfar Athletic in the first round and
   received a bye in the second, before beating Dundee East End 40 in the
   third round. The fourth round saw their first and only encounter with a
   league side in a competitive game, losing 31 at home to
   [42]Celtic.^[43][9] This was their final appearance in the Scottish Cup
   under their own name.

[[44]edit] Grounds

   Our Boys played at West Craigie Park from 1882 to the time of the
   merger with East End in 1893.^[45][10] The new [46]Dundee side
   initially played at West Craigie Park, although this lasted for only
   one season before they moved to East End's former ground, [47]Carolina
   Port. In 1898 Dundee moved to [48]Dens Park where they remain to the
   present day.

[[49]edit] Notable players

   Notable players include [50]James Coupar and [51]Fred Erentz who both
   left Our Boys in June 1892 to join [52]Newton Heath.
