   An Earthship is a utopian type of [13]passive solar home made of
   natural and recycled materials. Designed and marketed by Earthship
   Biotecture of [14]Taos, NM, the homes are primarily constructed to work
   [15]autonomously and are generally made of earth-filled [16]tires,
   utilising [17]thermal mass construction to naturally regulate indoor
   temperature. They also usually have their own special natural
   ventilation system. Earthships are a type of off-grid home, which
   minimizes their reliance on public utilities and [18]fossil fuels.

   Earthships are built to utilize the available local resources,
   especially energy from the sun. For example, windows on the sunny side
   admit light and heat, and the buildings are often horseshoe-shaped to
   maximize southern (or northern in the [19]southern hemisphere) sunlight
   and warmth in the colder months. Likewise, the thick, dense outer walls
   provide effective insulation against summer heat.

   Internal, non-load-bearing walls are often made of a "honey comb" of
   recycled cans joined by concrete and are referred to as [20]tin can
   walls. These walls are usually thickly plastered with [21]adobe or
   [22]stucco.

   The roof of an Earthship is heavily insulated - often with earth or
   adobe - for added energy efficiency.

[[41]edit] History

   The Earthship, as it exists today, began to take shape in the 1970s.
   [42]Mike Reynolds, founder of Earthship Biotecture, a company that
   specializes in designing and building Earthships, wanted to create a
   home that would do three things; first, it would be sustainable, using
   material indigenous to the entire planet as well as recycled materials
   wherever possible. Second, the homes would rely on natural energy
   sources and be independent from the grid, therefore being less
   susceptible to natural disasters and free from the electrical and water
   lines that Reynolds considered unsightly and wasteful. Finally, it
   would be economically feasible for the average person with no
   specialized construction skills to be able to create.

   Eventually, Reynolds' vision took the form of the common U-shaped
   earth-filled tire homes seen today. As a concept, the Earthship was not
   limited to tires - any dense material with a potential for thermal
   mass, such as concrete, adobe, or stone could theoretically be used to
   create an Earthship. However, the earth-rammed tire version of the
   Earthship is now the most common design, and is usually the only
   structure referred to as Earthship.

   Unlike other materials, rammed-earth tires are more accessible to the
   average person. Scrap tires are ubiquitous around the world and easy to
   come by; there are an estimated 2 billion tires throughout the United
   States. According to the Scrap Tire Management Council, as many as 253
   million scrap tires are generated each year in the United States and of
   those 253 million tires only 53% are reclaimed by the scrap tire
   market^[[43]citation needed]. In addition to the availability of scrap
   tires, the method by which they are converted into usable "bricks", the
   ramming of the earth, is simple and affordable.

   The earth rammed tires of an Earthship are usually assembled by teams
   of two people working together as part of a larger construction team.
   One member of the two person team shovels dirt, which usually comes
   from the building site, placing it into the tire one scoop at a time.
   The second member, who stands on the tire, uses a sledge hammer to pack
   the dirt in. The second person moves in a circle around the tire to
   keep the dirt even and avoid warping the tire. All tires in an
   Earthship are made in place because, when properly made, they weigh as
   much as 300 pounds and can be very difficult to relocate.

   Additional benefits of the rammed earth tire are its great load-bearing
   capacity and its resistance to fire.

   A fully rammed tire, which is about 2 feet 8 inches wide, is massive
   enough to surpass conventional requirements for structural load
   distribution to the earth. Because the tire is full of soil, it does
   not burn when exposed to fire. In 1996 after a fire swept through many
   conventional homes in New Mexico, an Earthship discovered in the
   aftermath was relatively unharmed^[[44]citation needed]. Only the
   south-facing wall and the roof had burned away, compared to the total
   destruction of the conventional homes. After testing the walls of an
   Earthship in [45]Ridgway, [46]Colorado, engineer Tom Griepentrog said,
   It is my opinion that the construction method is equivalent to or
   better than the general quality, strength, effectiveness, fire
   resistance, durability and safety that is required by the uniform
   building code.^[[47]citation needed]

   Currently, Earthships are in use in almost every state in the United
   States, as well as many countries in Europe. The use of insulation on
   the outside of tire walls, which was not common in early designs, is
   improving the viability of Earthships in every climate without
   compromising their durability. In the year 2000, Mike Reynolds, in
   partnership with Daren Howarth, launched Earthship Biotecture Europe,
   an organization that aims to explore and evolve the concept of the
   Earthship within a European context. Two more directors were appointed
   to Earthship Biotecture Europe in July 2006 - Kevan Trott and Kirsten
   Jacobsen.

[[48]edit] The Greater World Community

   The Greater World Community is a [49]housing development in [50]Taos,
   New Mexico that consists entirely of earthships. The Greater World
   became a legal [51]subdivision in 1998, and is now phasing its
   development so that building can continue in certain sections of the
   development. The project was designed to create an ideal condition from
   which a sustainable community can grow and flourish. This whole
   [52]community produces their own energy, harvests their own [53]water,
   contains and treats their own [54]sewage, manufactures [55]bio-diesel,
   and grows a great deal of their own food. The buildings also heat and
   cool themselves all the while utilizing the discarded materials of our
   society. This community attempts to lead a non-destructive existence
   that removes stress from the lives of people and the planet.^[56][1]

[[57]edit] Europe

   In 2004, the very first Earthship in the UK was opened at [58]Kinghorn
   Loch in Fife, Scotland. It was built by volunteers of the SCI charity.
   In 2005, the first earthship in England was established in Stanmer
   Park, Brighton.

   Earthship biotecture has now finalized plans for a planning application
   to build on a valuable development site overlooking the [59]Brighton
   Marina in the UK. The application follows the successful six-month
   feasibility study funded by the UK. Environment Agency and the Energy
   Savings Trust. The application calls for sixteen one, two, and
   three-bedroom earthship homes on this site. The homes are all designed
   according to basic earthship principles developed in the United States.
   15,000 tires will be recycled to construct these homes, which is
   definitely a small but progressive step for the earth's environmental
   health considering the fact that the UK burns approximately 40 million
   tires each year. The plans include the enhancement of habitats on the
   site for [60]lizards that already live there, which is the reasoning
   behind entitling the project, The Lizard. This will be the first
   development of its kind in Europe, and successful development in
   [61]Brighton may help to pave the way for similar projects around the
   UK and other places.^[62][2]

   The first official Earthship home in Europe with official planning
   commission approval was built in a small French village called Ger. The
   home, which is owned by Kevan and Gillian Trott, was built in April
   2007 by Kevan, Mike Reynolds and an Earthship Crew from Taos. The
   design was modified for a European climate and is seen as the first of
   many for the European arena. It is currently used as a holiday home for
   eco-tourists.^[63][3]

[[64]edit] Systems

   The Earthship was designed as a structure that would exist in harmony
   with its environment and be freed from the constraints of modern
   shelters which rely on centralized utilities. It is important that the
   Earthship create its own utilities as well as use readily available and
   sustainable materials. In order to be entirely self sufficient the
   Earthship needs to be able to handle the three systems of Water,
   Electricity and Climate. While these systems are not exclusive to
   Earthships, a properly designed Earthship must have these systems.

[[65]edit] Water

[[66]edit] Collection

   Earthships are designed to catch and use water from the local
   environment without bringing in water from a centralized source. Water
   used in an Earthship is harvested from rain or snow. As water collects
   on the roof it is channeled through a silt catching device and into a
   cistern. The cisterns are positioned so they gravity feed a WOM (water
   organization module), that filters out bacteria and makes it suitable
   for drinking. The WOM consists of filters and a DC-pump that are
   screwed into a panel. Water is then pushed into a conventional pressure
   tank to create common household water pressure. Water collected in this
   fashion is used for any household activities except flushing toilets
   the conventional way. Rather, flushing toilets can be done as a last
   step (after the water has been used for other purposes).

[[67]edit] Greywater

   [68]Greywater, water that has been used and is unsuitable for drinking,
   is used within the Earthship for a multitude of purposes once it is
   reclaimed. First, before the greywater can be reused, it is channeled
   through a grease and particle filter/digester and into a 30-60" deep
   rubber lined botanical cell, a miniature [69]living machine, within the
   Earthship. This filter with imbedded plants can potentially also be
   used to produce food (by using a [70]fruit tree, ...). Oxygenation,
   filtration, transpiration and bacteria encounter all take place within
   the cell and help to cleanse the water (Reynolds 2000). Within the
   botanical cell filtration is achieved by passing the water through a
   mixture of gravel and plant roots. Because of the nature of plants,
   oxygen is added to the water as it filters while nitrogen is removed.
   Water taken up through the plants and transpired at their tops helps to
   humidify the air. In the cell, bacteria will naturally grow and help to
   cleanse the water.

   Water from the low end of the botanical cell is then directed through a
   peat moss filter and collected in a reservoir or well. This reclaimed
   water is then passed once more through a grey water board (see
   earthship.net) and used to flush conventional toilets.

   Often, any greywater that is made at earthships, is not polluted enough
   to justify treatment (its "pollution" being usually just soap, which is
   often not environmentally damaging). At earthships, the use of plants
   placed at outlets of fixtures is then practiced to regain the nutrients
   lost (from the soaps, ...) and water from the greywater. Usually, a
   single plant is placed directly in front of the pipe, but mini drain
   fields are also sometimes used. The pipe is made large enough (5,08cm)
   so that the formation of underground gas (from the greywater) is
   avoided. This is done with kitchen, bathroom sinks and even showers,
   washing and dishwashing machines. The plants are usually placed indoors
   with the sinks and outdoors with the washing/dishwashing machines and
   shower (to avoid indoor "floods"). Also, with the latter, larger drain
   fields are used instead of a mere placing before an outlet.
   ^[71][4]^[72][5]

[[73]edit] Black water

   Black water, water that has been used in a toilet, was usually not
   created within many earthships as the use of conventional toilets was
   discouraged. ^[74][6] Instead, in the early days [75]composting toilets
   were advocated, which use no water at all. However, with the new
   greywater treatment system design (used in Nautilus, Helios, ...)
   created by Michael Reynolds, flush toilets have now found a place in
   the earthship and the general water system has been redesigned
   according to the new "6-step process".^[76][7]^[77][8]
   ^[78][9]^[79][10]Now, when the newly included flush-toilets are used,
   blackwater is not reused within the Earthship. Instead, blackwater is
   sent to a solar-enhanced septic tank with leech field and planter cells
   (the whole being often referred to as the incubator). The solar
   enhanced septic tank is a regular [80]septic tank which is [81]solar
   heated and glazed with a south-facing window. The incubator stores the
   sun's heat in its concrete mass, and is insulated, to help the
   anaerobic process. Water from the incubator is channeled out to an
   exterior [82]leech field and then to landscaping "planter cells"
   (spaces surrounded by concrete in which plants have been put). The
   cells are similar to the botanical cell used in greywater treatment and
   are usually placed just before and under the windows of the earthship.

   In cases where it is not possible to use flush-toilets operating on
   water, [83]dry solar toilets are now advocated, instead of regular
   [84]composting toilets. If this is the case, obviously no black water
   is formed and the use of an incubator is thus (usually) not necessairy.
   Instead, regular "planters" (plants used for sucking up
   water/nutrients) are then used. When using regular planters as well, no
   chemical soaps/detergents, ... can be used.

   The space where WOM, graywater pump panel, pressure tank, (first set
   of) batteries and POM (power organising module) and stored is in a
   small room referred to as the "systems package".

[[85]edit] Electricity

   Parts of DIY Wind turbine
   A PV-solar system

   Earthships are designed to collect and store their own energy from a
   variety of sources. The majority of electrical energy is harvested from
   the sun and wind. Photovoltaic panels and [86]windturbines located on
   or near the Earthship generate DC energy that is then stored in several
   types of deep cycle batteries. The space in which the batteries are
   kept is usually a special, purpose-built room placed on the roof.
   Additional energy, if required, can be obtained from gasoline powered
   generators or by integrating with the city grid.

   In an Earthship, a Power Organizing Module is used to take stored
   energy from batteries and invert it for AC use. The Power Organizing
   Module is a prefabricated system provided by Earthship Biotecture that
   is simply attached to a wall on the interior of the Earthship and wired
   in a conventional manner. It includes the necessary equipment such as
   circuit breakers and converters. The energy run through the Power
   Organizing Module can be used to run any house hold appliance
   including: Washing machines, computers, kitchen appliances, print
   machines, vacuums, etc. None of the electrical energy in an Earthship
   is used for heating or cooling.^[87][11]

[[88]edit] Climate

   The interior climate of an Earthship is stabilized and made comfortable
   by taking advantage of many phenomena. Mainly, the Earthship tries to
   take advantage of the properties of thermal mass and passive solar
   heating and cooling. Examples are large front [89]windows with
   integrated [90]shades, [91]trombe walls and other technologies such as
   [92]skylights or [93]Track Rack solar trackers (dualling as a energy
   generation device and passive solar source.

   The load bearing walls of an Earthship, which are made from steel
   belted tires rammed with earth, serve two purposes. First, they hold up
   the roof, and second, they provide a dense thermal mass that will soak
   up heat during the day and radiate heat during the night, keeping the
   interior climate relatively comfortable all day.

   In addition to high thermal mass, some Earthships may be earth
   sheltered. The benefits of earth sheltering are twofold because it adds
   to the thermal mass and, if the Earthship is buried deep enough, allows
   the structure to take advantage of the earth's stable temperature.

   The Earthship is designed in such a way that the sun provides heating,
   ventilation and lighting. To take advantage of the sun, an Earthship
   (in the northern hemisphere) is positioned so that its southern wall,
   which is nonstructural and made mostly of glass sheets, faces directly
   south. This positioning allows for optimum solar exposure.

   To allow the sun to heat the mass of the Earthship, the southern wall
   is angled so that it is perpendicular to light from the winter sun.
   This allows for maximum exposure in the winter, when heat is wanted,
   and lesser exposure in the summer, when heat is to be avoided. Some
   Earthships, especially those built in colder climates, use insulated
   shading on the southern wall to reduce heat loss during the night
   (Reynolds 2000).

[[94]edit] Natural ventilation

   The ventilation system of an earthship

   The earthships usually use their own [95]natural ventilation system. It
   consists of cold(er) air coming in from a front ("hopper") window,
   especially made for this purpose and flowing out through (one of) the
   skylights that are placed on the earthship. As hot air rises, the
   system maintains itself and keeps sucking in (and out), air.

[[96]edit] Heating Problems

   [97]Bottle walls are used in earthships such as this earthship
   bathroom, located in Phoenix, USA
   [98]Bottle walls may be made from recycled [99]mason jars, such as this
   jam jar, from the [100]supermarket

   Earthships rely on a balance between the solar heat gain and the
   ability of the tire walls and subsoil to transport and store heat. The
   design intends to require little if any auxiliary heat. Some earthships
   have suffered from over-heating and some from over-cooling, because of
   a failure to adjust for local conditions.

   Some earthships appear to have serious problems with heat loss. In
   these cases heat appears to be leaking into the ground constantly
   during the heating season and being lost. This situation may have
   arisen from the mistaken belief that ground-coupled structures
   (building in thermal contact with the ground) do not require
   insulation. The situation may also be due to large climatic differences
   between the sunny, arid and warm Southwest (of the USA) where
   earthships were first built and the cloudier, cooler and wetter
   climates where some are now being built. [101]Malcolm Wells, an
   architect and authority on earth sheltered design, recommends
   [102]R-value 10 insulation between deep soils and heated spaces.
   Wells's insulation recommendations increase as the depth of the soil
   decreases.

   In very limited and specific situations, uncommon during the heating
   season, [103]thermal mass can marginally increase the apparent R-value
   of a building assembly such as a wall. Generally speaking [104]thermal
   mass and [105]R-value are distinct thermodynamic properties and should
   not be equated. Thermal performance problems apparently seen in some
   earthship designs may have occurred because of thermal mass being
   erroneously equated to R-value.

   The R-value of soil is about 1 per foot.^[106][12]

[[107]edit] Potential advantages

     * Having an earth-bermed home with windows facing the sun is a good
       idea in any climate where heating is required.
     * Collecting rainwater that falls on the roof reduces the runoff
       impact of the building and may reduce water and even sewer service
       fees.
     * Having a combination of [108]photovoltaic cells and wind generation
       is a prudent way to provide electricity in many situations.
     * Using curved modules as horizontal arches to resist earth loads is
       a sound structural design.
     * On-site processing of runoff water, grey water and black water
       using plant beds reduces the environmental impact of the building.
     * Rubber tires make a wind and puncture resistant wall. They may be
       safe from outgassing when plastered semi airtight.
     * Rubber tires are usually free and it may be possible to be paid to
       take them.

[[109]edit] Potential disadvantages

     * The sloped glazing may be hard to keep watertight and in warm
       climates allows excessive solar gain in summer. In colder climates,
       the glazing itself, which has far poorer insulating properties than
       any other component, will obviously be the major conduit of heat
       loss in winter. New designs call for vertical windows with an
       overhang.
     * Uninsulated ground-coupled thermal mass presents a large potential
       for heat loss, especially in climates with a heating season. This
       varies to a degree with soil type and moisture content.
     * Rubber tire walls tend to lack structural stiffness and may require
       perpendicular stiffening ribs.
     * The novel design may diminish resale value or make buyers more
       difficult to find.
     * The intimate ground contact inherent in this approach may increase
       hazards due to soil gases including [110]Radon, and those due to
       water intrusion.
     * Packing or ramming dirt into the inside of tires is a very labor
       intensive process.
     * Many Earthship builders are drawn to this system by its apparently
       low environmental impact. However, this is only valid if the design
       is highly thermally efficient. Earthship designs may require
       substantial thermal analysis and redesign to be adapted to
       non-Southwest USA climate.
     * Earthships built with concrete, sand bags or adobe and with better
       solar and heat control perform better.
