Eduardo Scarpetta

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Eduardo Scarpetta (1853 -1925) was an [8]Italian actor and playwright
   from [9]Naples. Although not from a theatrical family, he was on the
   stage by the age of four and is today best remembered as the creator of
   a character that became his stage alter-ego: Felice Sciosciammocca, a
   typical, good-natured Neapolitan. The name "Sciosciammocca" translates
   from [10]Neapolitan as "breath in mouth"thus, with "Felice" (Happy) the
   name conveys something like wide-eyed and perhaps a bit
   scatter-brained. The character was a break with the traditional
   portrayal of the Neapolitan streetwise Everyman and, as an implied
   stereotype, invites comparison to the well-known, darker historical
   Neapolitan "mask" of [11]Pulcinella. The character appears prominently
   in Scarpettas best-known work, Miseria e Nobilt (Misery and Nobility)
   from the year 1888. The work is well known, too, as a 1954 film
   featuring Neapolitan comic [12]Tot as Felice Sciosciammocca; the film
   also features the young [13]Sophia Loren. Scarpetta dedicated much of
   his early activity to translating into Neapolitan the standard Parisian
   farce comedy of the day, such as [14]Hennequin, [15]Meilhac,
   [16]Labiche and [17]Feydeau. His own original comedies comprise some 50
   works. He was the illegitimate father of actor and playwright
   [18]Eduardo De Filippo as well as of Eduardo's brother and sister, all
   of whom comprised the best-known theatrical family in twentieth-century
   Naples.
