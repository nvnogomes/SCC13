Douglas Sutherland

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Douglas Sutherland (1919 [8]28 August [9]1995) was a [10]British author
   and journalist, who was born at Bongate Hall,
   [11]Appleby-in-Westmorland, in 1919. He always joked that the error of
   judgement in his not being born in [12]Scotland was compensated for a
   year later by his family moving to live in the remote island of
   [13]Stronsay in [14]Orkney.^[[15]citation needed]

[[16]edit] Background

   The family later moved to [17]Aberdeenshire, and Douglas followed his
   elder brother to [18]Trinity College, Glenalmond. In 1938, Douglas
   joined the army as a [19]Private with the [20]King's Own Scottish
   Borderers. He was later [21]commissioned into the [22]King's
   (Liverpool) Regiment, and saw active service during the [23]Second
   World War, for which he was awarded the [24]Military Cross and was
   twice [25]mentioned in Despatches. In 1945, he was posted to [26]Field
   Marshal Sir [27]Bernard Montgomery's [28]21st Army Group Headquarters
   at [29]Bad Oeynhausen, where he joined the Allied Liaison Branch, and
   was an observer at the [30]Nuremberg Trials.

[[31]edit] Career

   Returning to London at the age of 26, Sutherland would observe that his
   first challenge as a civilian was sartorial.^[[32]citation needed] To
   this end, he was helped by [33]Oscar Hammerstein, the American
   lyricist, who was a friend of his first wife [34]Moyra Fraser, the
   ballet dancer. Hammerstein presented him with his cast-off
   suits,^[[35]citation needed] and thus attired, he began working as a
   journalist for the [36]Evening Standard, and later, the [37]Daily
   Express.

   Sutherland's life during this period is affectionately depicted in
   Portrait of a Decade, where he recalls many of the colourful characters
   of 1950s London, centred on [38]Muriel Belcher's famous Colony Club in
   Dean Street, [39]Soho. However, he will be best remembered for his
   best-selling humour series that began with The English Gentleman, and
   was followed by The English Gentleman's Wife/Child/Mistress, and The
   English Gentleman Abroad. Although he later claimed that the English
   [40]Gentleman no longer existed, his observations on the species remain
   classic period commentaries.^[[41]citation needed]

   But there was also a deeply serious side to his writing. His
   highly-acclaimed biographies feature such widely contrasting
   personalities as the sporting [42]Earl of Lonsdale (The Yellow Earl),
   and, with Jon Connell, founder of [43]The Week magazine, the life of
   the international fraudster [44]Emil Savundra, which won the Crime
   Writer's [45]Silver Dagger Award for the best non-fiction crime book of
   the year.

   In 1963, with Anthony Purdy, he published a book called Burgess and
   Maclean. At that time he had identified with total certainty that the
   fourth shadowy figure involved in the notorious spy ring of the 1950s
   was Sir [46]Anthony Blunt. So sure was Sutherland that in the course of
   his research he approached Blunt for a meeting over a drink at the
   [47]Travellers Club in London.^[[48]citation needed] Blunt's response
   was to threaten legal action should his name appear anywhere connected
   with the case.^[[49]citation needed] Further pressure was then placed
   on the authors from the highest level, and Sutherland and Purdy were
   obliged to suppress their information for reasons of national
   security.^[[50]citation needed] After Blunt's exposure some twenty
   years later, Sutherland immediately released The Fourth Man, the first
   full uncensored account of the intrigue.

   Having married three times, Sutherland settled in Scotland with his
   third wife Diana. His latter years were marred by a dispute over the
   publishing [51]royalties of the English Gentleman series,^[[52]citation
   needed] and he died at [53]South Queensferry on [54]28 August [55]1995.
