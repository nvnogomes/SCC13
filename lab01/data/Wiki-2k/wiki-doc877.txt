   The Royal Society of Edinburgh's Building on the corner of George St
   and Hanover St

   The Royal Society of Edinburgh is [9]Scotland's [10]national academy of
   science and letters. The membership consists of over 1400 peer-elected
   fellows, who are known as Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
   denoted FRSE in official titles. It provides annual grants totalling
   over half a million pounds for research and entrepreneurship. The
   Society organises public lectures and promotes the sciences in schools
   throughout [11]Scotland.

   It covers a broader selection of fields than the [12]Royal Society
   including [13]literature and [14]history.

[[19]edit] History

   At the start of the eighteenth century, [20]Edinburgh's intellectual
   climate fostered many clubs and societies (see [21]Scottish
   Enlightenment). Though there were several that treated the arts,
   sciences and medicine, the most prestigious was the [22]Philosophical
   Society which was founded in 1738. With the help of [23]University of
   Edinburgh professors like [24]Joseph Black, [25]William Cullen and
   [26]John Walker, this society transformed itself into the Royal Society
   of Edinburgh in 1783 and in 1786 it issued the first edition of its new
   journal Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ([27]ISSN
   [28]0263-5933).

   As the end of the century drew near, the younger members like Sir
   [29]James Hall embraced [30]Lavoisier's new nomenclature and the
   members split over the practical and theoretical objectives of the
   society. This resulted in the founding of the [31]Wernerian Society
   (1808-1858), a parallel organisation that focused more upon natural
   history and scientific research that could be used to improve
   Scotland's weak agricultural and industrial base. Under the leadership
   of Prof. [32]Robert Jameson, the Wernerians first founded Memoirs of
   the Wernerian Natural History Society (1808-1821) and then the
   Edinburgh Philosophical Journal (1822), thereby diverting the output of
   the Royal Society's Transactions. Thus, for the first four decades of
   the nineteenth century, the RSE's members published brilliant articles
   in two different journals. By the 1850s, Jameson and his partner Sir
   [33]David Brewster lost their influence and the society once again
   could unify its membership under one journal.

   During the nineteenth century the society produced many scientists
   whose ideas laid the foundation of the modern sciences. From the
   twentieth century onward, the society functioned not only as focal
   point for Scotland's eminent scientists, but also the arts and
   humanities. It still exists today and continues to promote original
   research in Scotland.

   The current president is former [34]Governor of Hong Kong [35]Lord
   Wilson of Tillyorn.
