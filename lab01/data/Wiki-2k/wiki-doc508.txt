                              Dundonald Castle

   Dundonald Castle is situated on a hill overlooking the village of
   [14]Dundonald, between [15]Kilmarnock and [16]Troon in [17]South
   Ayrshire, [18]Scotland. Dundonald Castle is a fortified [19]tower house
   built for [20]Robert II on his accession to the [21]throne of Scotland
   in 1371 and it was used as a royal residence by the early [22]Stewart
   kings for the next 150 years.

[[30]edit] History

[[31]edit] Dark age hill fort

   The present castle stands on land where evidence suggest there used to
   be a [32]hill fort. It is thought that a mixture of large timber built
   round houses and straight-sided structures occupy the interior. A
   timber laced stone rampart defines and defends the hill fort. The
   timber lacing caught fire and burnt with such intensity that the
   surrounding stonework melted, or [33]vitrified. This firing happened
   about 1000 AD and seems to mark the end of the hill-forts existence.

   It was about this date that the independence of the British [34]Kingdom
   of Strathclyde ceased, being absorbed into the [35]kingdom of Scotland.

   The place name Dundonald means Donalds Fort. Historians do not know who
   Donald was but he may have been one of three [36]kings of that name who
   ruled in Strathclyde in the 10th century.

[[37]edit] Early castles

   There have been three [38]medieval castles present on this site. The
   first was built by one of the stewards of the king of Scots, most
   probably [39]Walter, the first steward, who came to Scotland in 1136.
   There is no surviving evidence of this castle above ground today.

   The second castle was built in the late 13th Century by [40]Alexander
   Stewart, 4th High Steward, this castle was predominantly built of
   stone. It would have been one of the grandest baronial residences of
   its time. It was largely destroyed by the English during the [41]Wars
   of Scottish Independence wars of independence in the early 14th
   century. There is little remaining of this castle, however there is a
   well and a rounded stump of a tower near to the present castle.

[[42]edit] The present castle

   The third castle was built by Robert Stewart, probably to mark his
   accession to the throne as Robert II in 1371. It was three storeys
   high.

   The top floor above the lofty stone vault was the upper hall the
   [43]great hall. It was for the more private use of the king and family.

   The first floor was the lower of the two halls the laigh hall. It would
   have been used for more public activities like feasting and the holding
   of the baron court.

   The ground floor was a storage area. It was probably originally
   subdivided providing cellars for different commodities like wine, ale,
   foodstuffs and fuel.

   The tower house was extended in the 15th century to add additional
   private chambers and a prison. The outer courtyard (called more
   properly the [44]barmkin) was completed and ancillary buildings
   (stables, bakehouses, brewhouses, smithy, etc) built against the
   barmkin wall.

   The third castle comprises almost everything you see above ground
   today, including the tower which dominates the hill.

   Dundonald castle once had its own chapel dedicated to [45]Saint
   Inan.^[46][1]

[[47]edit] The castle today

   There is a visitor centre at the foot of the hill, which includes a
   cafe, souvenir shop and an interpretive exhibition. The exhibition
   outlines the history of the Castle and its preceding buildings with
   detailed models of the earlier castles on the site.

   The visitor centre is owned by [48]South Ayrshire Council and is
   operated on their behalf by The Friends of Dundonald Castle.
