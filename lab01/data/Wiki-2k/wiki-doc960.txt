[[32]edit] Life and work

   Born in [33]Highland Park, [34]Illinois on [35]March 24, [36]1886.
   ^[37][1] He was given his first [38]camera, a Kodak Bull's-Eye #2, for
   his 16th birthday, when he began taking photographs. His favorite
   hangouts were [39]Chicago parks and a farm owned by his aunt. Weston
   met with quick success and the [40]Chicago Art Institute exhibited his
   photographs a year later, in 1903. He attended the [41]Illinois College
   of Photography.

   In 1906, Weston moved to [42]California, where he decided to stay and
   pursue a [43]career in photography. He had four sons with his wife,
   Flora May Chandler (whom he married in 1909): Edward Chandler (1910),
   [44]Theodore Brett (1911), Laurence (1914) and [45]Cole (1919). In
   1910, Weston opened his first [46]photographic studio in Tropico,
   California (now [47]Glendale) and wrote articles about his
   unconventional methods of [48]portraiture for several high-circulation
   magazines.

   In 1922, Weston experienced a transition from [49]pictorialism to
   [50]straight photography, becoming "the pioneer of precise and sharp
   presentation". His pictures included the human figure as well as items
   of nature, including seaside wildlife, plants, and landscapes. [51]Tina
   Modotti, his professional (and romantic) partner, often accompanied him
   to Mexico, creating much gossip in the media. Weston's sons were also
   frequent companions, receiving lessons in photography from their
   experienced father. Brett and Cole later embarked on their own careers
   in the field, along with Weston's grandson [52]Kim and
   great-granddaughter Christine.

   After 1927, Weston worked mainly with [53]nudes, still life his
   [54]shells and vegetable studies were especially important and
   landscape subjects. [55]Henrietta Shore was a companion in the 1930s;
   her paintings influenced him to photograph her shells.^[56][2] After a
   few exhibitions of his works in [57]New York, he co-founded [58]Group
   f/64 in 1932 with [59]Ansel Adams, [60]Willard Van Dyke and others. The
   term f/64 referred to a very small [61]aperture setting on a [62]large
   format camera, which secured great [63]depth of field, making a
   photograph appear evenly sharp from foreground to background. Weston
   also achieved great sharpness by not enlarging. He made contact prints
   from his 4x5" or 8x10" negatives. The detailed, straight photography
   that the group espoused was in opposition to the [64]pictorialist
   soft-edged methods that were still in fashion at the time.

   In 1937 the [65]Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation awarded Weston a
   fellowship, the first given to a photographer. He married his
   assistant, Charis Wilson, the following year (they had lived together
   since 1934, and divorced in 1946). During this time he received
   exclusive commissions and published several books, some with Wilson,
   including an edition of [66]Whitman's [67]Leaves of Grass illustrated
   with his photographs. He also produced some of his few [68]color
   photographs with Willard Van Dyke in 1947. Weston also collaborated on
   several volumes of his photographs with photography critic [69]Nancy
   Newhall, beginning in 1946.

   The [70]Center for Creative Photography at the [71]University of
   Arizona in Tucson houses a full archive of Edward Weston's work.

[[72]edit] Illness and death

   Stricken with [73]Parkinson's Disease, Weston made his last photographs
   at [74]Point Lobos State Reserve in 1948. 1952 saw the publication of a
   50th-anniversary portfolio of his work, printed by his son Brett. Brett
   and Cole Weston, as well as Brett's wife Dody Warren, were appointed to
   [75]print 800 of what he considered his most important [76]negatives
   under his supervision in the years 1955 to 1956.

   Edward Weston died in his house on Wildcat Hill in [77]Carmel Highlands
   in [78]Big Sur, California on [79]January 1, [80]1958, aged 71.^[81][3]

[[82]edit] Legacy

   His comprehensive legacy includes the detailed and articulate Daybooks
   he kept regularly from the mid-1920s to 1934, which allow a very
   intimate glimpse into his personal life, his views on photography, and
   his working methods. Weston is generally recognized as one of the
   greatest photographic artists of the 20th century.

[[83]edit] Images

   Most Popular: "Pepper #30"; "Dunes, Oceano", "Nude, 1936"

   Price History:
   1970s: $500 - $1,500
   1980s: $3,000 - $50,000
   1990s: $10,000 - $300,000
   Current: $5,000 - $1.6M

   Most of his photographs are rare and unnumbered and few vintage
   photographs are available.

   Even though he was a celebrated photographer he survived selling his
   photos for a humble price of $7-10. Now, they have gone up over
   1,000,000% in value.

[[84]edit] Quotations

   "Photography to the amateur is recreation, to the professional it is
   work, and hard work too, no matter how pleasurable it may be."

   "The camera should be used for a recording of life, for rendering the
   very substance and quintessence of the thing itself, whether it be
   polished steel or palpitating flesh."

   "I cannot believe I learned anything of value in school unless it be
   the will to rebel."

   "I want the stark beauty that a lens can so exactly render presented
   without interference of artistic effect."
