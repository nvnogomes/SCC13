[[28]edit] Career

   He was elected [29]Member of Parliament for [30]Chichester in 1894, a
   seat he held until 1921, and became a [31]Privy Counsellor in 1918.

   On [32]27 April [33]1921 he was appointed [34]Lord Lieutenant of
   Ireland, the first [35]Roman Catholic to be appointed to the position
   since 1685 during the reign of [36]King James II. His appointment was
   possible because Section 37 of the [37]Government of Ireland Act 1920
   had been brought into force shortly beforehand.^[38][2] That provision
   provided that no British subject would be disqualified from holding the
   position on account of his religious belief. Concerning the
   announcement of his impending appointment, the [39]Daily Chronicle
   observed that "the concillatory motive of his appointment [being a
   Roman Catholic] is obvious...it is an olive branch in place of a
   dictatorship."^[40][3]

   However, his tenure as Lord Lieutenant lasted only a year and a half.
   The post was abolished with the coming into existence of the [41]Irish
   Free State and its [42]constitution in 1922. The position was replaced
   by the offices of the [43]Governor-General of the Irish Free State and
   the [44]Governor of Northern Ireland.

   The day after his appointment as Lord Lieutenant he was raised to the
   [45]Peerage as "Viscount FitzAlan of [46]Derwent" in the [47]County of
   Derby. In addition, during the minority of his nephew the [48]16th Duke
   of Norfolk, who succeeded to the Dukedom in 1917, he served as Deputy
   [49]Earl Marshal.

[[50]edit] Surname

   Lord FitzAlan of Derwent was born with the surname "FitzAlan-Howard".
   However, in 1876 he assumed by Royal licence the surname "Talbot" as
   part of an unsuccessful attempt to succeed as [51]Earl of Shrewsbury.
   He returned to the use of his paternal name by Royal Licence in 1921,
   shortly after being raised to the Peerage.

[[52]edit] Personal life

   Lord FitzAlan of Derwent married Lady Mary Bertie (18591938), daughter
   of the [53]7th Earl of Abingdon, on [54]5 August [55]1879. He died on
   [56]18 May [57]1947 at the age of 91, and was succeeded in the
   Viscountcy by his only son [58]Henry.
