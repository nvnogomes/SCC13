[[53]edit] Plot

   A scientific team picks through the ruins of [54]Tokyo, searching for
   tissue samples left behind by [55]Godzilla following his previous
   rampage. A team of American paramilitary soldiers working for a United
   States-based genetics research company called Bio-Major attempts to
   escape with a sample, but is overcome by a lone mercenary and the
   samples are stolen.

   Meanwhile, in the [56]Middle East, researcher Genshiro Shiragami looks
   forward to returning home to [57]Japan with his daughter, Erika.
   However, a terrorist bombing destroys his research facility and kills
   Erika.

   Five years later, Dr. Shiragami is now a haunted dreamer, who has
   lately turned most of his attention to the study of the psychic energy
   of [58]roses. Psychic [59]Miki Saegusa, who also heads an institution
   for intuitive children, aids him in his research. Dr. Shiragami is now
   seen as a harmless old man who uses his scientific knowledge to satisfy
   his own curiosity.

   However, two groups are watching Shiragami: a gang of thieves hired by
   Bio-Major and an assassin from a Middle Eastern country called Saradia.
   As it turns out, Dr. Shiragami is involved in the study of Godzilla
   cells. It is believed by Shiragami's employers that he is aiding them
   in figuring out how to utilize the cells' properties to create
   Anti-Nuclear Bacteria (ANB), which is supposed to be used as weapons
   against Godzilla. The bacteria are designed to devour all radioactive
   material, and should prove fatal to Godzilla, but Shiragami has been
   conducting his own secret experiments.

   When the thieves and the assassin catch each other breaking into
   Shiragami's laboratory, a gunfight ensues. It is interrupted by an
   attack of a giant, mobile plant that kills one man and nearly kills
   another. The surviving thief flees, and the assassin barely escapes
   from the plant's grasp. They do not realize that they have just
   encountered the result of Dr. Shiragami's secret experimentations.

   The next morning a giant flower is seen in a nearby lake, and Dr.
   Shiragami confesses that he combined the DNA of roses with Godzilla.
   Furthermore, he confesses privately to a young official that he had, in
   a fit of desperate grief, added Erika's DNA to the mutated genetic
   structure, so that some of the creature is composed of Erika as well.
   He names his creation Biollante.

   Meanwhile, Bio-Major anonymously sends a letter to the [60]Diet of
   Japan, informing them that they have planted several bombs inside Mt.
   Mihara. If the anti-nuclear bacteria is not handed over, the company
   threatens to detonate the bombs and release Godzilla. With the country
   held hostage, the Diet is forced to comply. The trade-off with the
   remaining thief goes well until Shiragami's assassin kills the thief.
   The thief dies before he can show Lieutenant Goro Gondo and Dr.
   Kazuhito Kirishima how to deactivate the timed explosives. Godzilla is
   released as Mt. Mihara erupts.

   Upon hearing Godzilla's [61]roar, Biollante's blossom opens, and the
   monstrous plant begins calling out to Godzilla. Dr. Shiragami theorizes
   that this is because both Godzilla and Biollante are essentially the
   same being. With Godzilla's destination made clear, the Japan
   Self-Defense Forces, under the leadership of Major Sho Koruki, prepare
   their strategies for dealing with the mutant dinosaur. The Super-X II,
   a remote controlled and stronger version of the Super-X, is deployed,
   and though at first seems effective in combating Godzilla, is
   eventually overwhelmed by Godzilla's atomic ray, and is forced to
   retreat.

   Godzilla reaches Biollante. A huge battle ensues, and briefly it
   appears that there is a stalemate. However, Godzilla defeats Biollante
   with his atomic ray With Biollante apparently dead, Godzilla continues
   on. Godzilla, running low on radioactive energy after its fights with
   the Super-X II and Biollante, heads towards the nearest operational
   nuclear reactor, which is located in Tsuruga, on the other side of the
   country. The military is sent out to meet Godzilla at Iso Bay.

   Godzilla surfaces in Osaka bay, avoiding a confrontation with the JSDF.
   Saegusa tries to help, attempting to make Godzilla turn away from
   Osaka. Her efforts distract Godzilla momentarily, but the force of
   Godzilla's will and his physic brainpower overwhelms her and faints. A
   plan is put into action, involving infecting Godzilla with the regained
   ANB. In its final battle, the Super X-II is destroyed by Godzilla after
   luring it into Osaka's business district. Lieutenant Gondo and his
   soldiers use rocket launchers equipped with the ANB. The operation is
   initially successful, despite the death of Lieutenant Gondo, with ANB
   injected into Godzilla into three points in his body. Godzilla is
   unaffected by it, and continues on.

   The failure of the bacteria to work is attributed to Godzilla's low
   body temperature, which keeps the bacteria in a near-dormant state. If
   Godzilla can be heated, Shiragami theorizes, then the ANB should work.
   The JSDF develops another plan: force Godzilla onto a field of
   microwave-emitting plates during an artificial thunderstorm, where it
   will be heated by the microwaves.

   The operation begins, but it seems that Godzilla is not affected by the
   microwaves as he crushes it. Just as everything seems lost, a low
   rumble is heard and Biollante's spores rain down from the sky. Suddenly
   a larger more Godzilla-like Biollante emerges from the ground. After
   destroying all nearby land forces, Biollante attacks Godzilla, and the
   two massive monsters fight to the death with Godzilla winning the
   battle by blasting his atomic ray into Biollante's mouth. However,
   Godzilla falls headfirst into the ocean because of the ANB. With
   Godzilla temporarly knocked out, Biollante returns to her spore form
   disintegrating and once again firing her spores into space. As the
   monster's remains float upwards, Dr. Shiragami sees the image of his
   daughter among the spores. Calling out to her, he walks forward and
   gets killed by the Saradian agent, who is still after Godzilla's cells.
   Dr. Kirishima chases the agent and fights him. The agent is at a
   disadvantage until he is able to grab his weapon again. The Saradian
   agent attempts to kill Kirishima, but Major Koruki disintegrates the
   terrorist.

   The characters celebrate their victory when Godzilla returns from the
   sea waters. The body of Dr. Shiragami is placed inside a tent, with his
   superior briefly mourning him before leaving. Erika is heard to comment
   on the events of the film, and the film concludes with a shot of
   Godzilla swimming away.

   [74]Godzilla
   First Appearance [75]Godzilla vs Biollante
   Created By [76]Shinichiro Kobayashi

   Biollante (, Biorante^[77]?) is a [78]daikaiju (strange beast or
   monster) from the [79]Godzilla film series. She made her first
   appearance in the 1989 feature Godzilla vs. Biollante. She was never
   put into any other Godzilla movies, although she is featured as a
   secret character in [80]Godzilla: Unleashed on the Nintendo Wii.

[[81]edit] Appearance

   At first, Biollante was a giant rose with teeth inside her bud and long
   vines (merely a heavily-mutated and exceptionally large "thinking"
   rose). In her second form, the Godzilla genes took over and Biollante's
   body became an abomination of biological science. Biollante's second
   form had a head like a [82]mosasaur's and a maw with knife-like teeth,
   even on the interior lining of her mouth. In addition, six large tusks
   (three on each side of her mouth) protruded from the fulcrum-region of
   her mouth. Large numbers of vines and tendrils were a primary feature
   of Biollante. Some vines ended in sharp, spear-like ends, while others
   sported small, sharp-toothed mouths. In Biollante's first form, a
   large, fleshy sac was surrounded by her overlaying vines. In her second
   form, what appeared to be meaty flesh was seen underneath the tangled
   mess of vines and plant-tissue. The fleshy surface was pink and had
   many wrinkles and lines, resembling a brain-like surface.

[[83]edit] Abilities

   Biollante, in her rose form, could constrict and grapple with an enemy
   through the use of numerous vines, some of which ended with fanged
   mouths that not only were able to bite an opponent but were capable of
   spitting a highly corrosive acid sap that could blind an opponent. If
   severely injured, Biollante could dissolve into golden energy spores
   and ascend into space for recovery. In Biollante's rose form, her
   cellular division was shown to be abnormally affected by [84]Godzilla's
   atomic beam, resulting in heavy bodily damage. Biollante's second form
   was displayed as a horrible plant abomination sporting a massive jawed
   head with countless teeth and enormous tusks; an arched back with
   plate-like plant spines; and four stubby, root-like legs that Biollante
   utilized as a means of locomotion. Biollante retained all former
   abilities as well as gaining the ability to release large quantities of
   radioactive corrosive sap from the mouth. Several of her vines also
   ended in thorny spears which were capable of penetrating even
   Godzilla's flesh. Despite her plant-like body and rather unwieldy
   appearance, Biollante was capable of moving across the ground rather
   quickly.

[[85]edit] Origin

   After Godzilla's return in 1984, the city of Tokyo, Japan had suffered
   a great deal of destruction. During the aftermath and cleanup, forensic
   workers collected small remains of skin from Godzilla, which were later
   transported to a government lab facility in the arid wasteland of
   Saradia. A scientist by the name of Dr. Shiragami intended to use the
   genetic material of the Godzilla cells in the skin to genetically
   enhance various species of plants to create crops resistant to harsh
   weather and unfavorable conditions of Saradia. Unfortunately, numerous
   other nations did not approve of this move in agricultural wealth-as
   Saradia relied on exports for its produce-and an act of terrorism was
   put into plan to bomb the laboratory working with the cells. Amongst
   the scientists who lost their lives was Erika Shiragami, Dr.
   Shiragami's daughter. Her loss was terrible to him, and he proceeded to
   collect DNA from his daughter and splice it with that of a rosebush in
   hopes of preserving his daughter's spiritual entity. Five years later,
   in 1989, an earthquake destroyed the roses' shelter, thereby killing
   several. Dr. Shiragami panicked, and carried out a risky and
   unauthorized plan to splice the Godzilla DNA with a lone rose, in hopes
   that the rose would remain alive and hopefully invincible. However, the
   seemingly successful fusion of the cells resulted in the slow but
   eventual growth and mutation of the rose, which eventually became
   capable of thinking and moving, and eventually proceeded to smash its
   way through the laboratory wall, making its way to Lake Ashino, where
   it rooted itself and took up residence.

[[86]edit] First Battle

   Biollante's first encounter with Godzilla was inevitable. Godzilla had
   actually sensed the presence of another living being with the same
   genetic makeup as himself, and felt an uncontrollable urge to travel to
   the originating site of this feeling. It was also mentioned by Miki
   Saegusa, an individual endowed with [87]ESP, that Biollante had been
   "calling out to Godzilla" (whether or not this calling was intentional
   or not was never explained). Biollante, in her first encounter, fought
   defensively with wave after wave of tangling [88]vines. Despite the
   great effort that the plant/monster hybrid exerted, it failed miserably
   and took heavy damage from Godzilla's atomic beam. Godzilla eventually
   managed to set Biollante aflame as Biollante seemingly burned to death.
   However, it was reaffirmed that Biollante was immortal as everyone
   watched Biollante begin dissolving into energy particles to ascend into
   space.

   ===Final Battle=== had clearly turned the offensive/defensive tables.
   Biollante was clearly pursuing and fighting Godzilla offensively, to
   eliminate his threat to the inhabitants of Earth. Whereas, Godzilla was
   now fighting with all his might to defend himself against such a
   colossus who fought just as headed out to sea to recuperate.

[[89]edit] Aftermath

   Through the years up until 1993, stray particles of Biollante's DNA
   might have become lost in space, and eventually gone through a complex
   process of galactic mutation, resulting in the creation of one of
   Godzilla's toughest foes, [90]SpaceGodzilla. There has been controversy
   among moviergoers over who the true carrier of the DNA was, with
   [91]Mothra being the other possible candidate. Some of SpaceGodzilla's
   physical appearance points to Biollante being the creature more likely
   to be involved in its origin. The heads on both monsters are clearly
   similar when compared but because Toho has not taken a clear stance on
   the issue, it is left to conjecture. The possibility of Biollante's DNA
   creating SpaceGodzilla is further supported by the similarity in their
   vocals, since Space Godzilla's vocal is quite akin to the wailing cry
   emitted by Biollante.

[[92]edit] Trivia

     * Biollante was slated to appear in [93]Godzilla: Save the Earth, but
       was cut in the final stages. At the time, the design team had
       trouble conceptualizing how Biollante's sheer mass and slow
       movement would translate to such a fast-paced game. A character
       model, sound set and attack list was created but sadly omitted from
       the final product. Some early screen shots exist of Biollante from
       Save the Earth, and it has been suggested by members of the design
       team primarily through the www.Godzilla.com user forums that the
       Biollante data programmed for StE was saved and then later
       translated for use in the Wii version of [94]Godzilla: Unleashed.
       Due to the massive engine overhaul, Biollante fits in perfectly
       with the roster and is the game's largest and most physically
       powerful character. She is a member of the Mutant faction.

     * Biollante is a boss in [95]Godzilla Unleashed: Double Smash and had
       a special chemical spilled on her which cause her to grow even
       larger.

     * Biollante's wailing cry was used for a myriad of other [96]Toho
       movies, including the [97]J-Horror movie [98]Ring 2 and the
       [99]Science Fiction film [100]Sayonara Jupiter.

     * In Marc Cerasini's [101]Godzilla: At World's End, Biollante is a
       genetically engineered monster created by a nearly-extinct race of
       crystalline beings known as the Old Ones. Biollante remained
       stationary (possibly in a state of hibernation) within the Old
       Ones' lost city until the arrival of a group of human explorers and
       (soon after) Godzilla. After nearly killing Godzilla, Biollante is
       set on fire by Godzilla, and although the flames were put out when
       the city was flooded, it can be assumed that Biollante was killed
       when cavern containing the Old Ones' Necropolis collapses. This
       version of Biollante has no connection to Godzilla.

     * Biollante's exact relationship to Godzilla is difficult to place.
       Although the two have been referred to as brother and sister, it is
       more scientifically accurate that Biollante should be considered
       Godzilla's biological daughter, due to the fact that she was
       created by injecting cells from Godzilla into a rose, creating a
       being who has only half Godzilla's genetic information, in the way
       that two parents share genetic material to create offspring. In the
       same regard, her relationship to [102]SpaceGodzilla, whose own
       origins are convoluted and difficult to pin down, is just as
       difficult to quantify. One possible origin for SpaceGodzilla that
       was given is that some of the cells of Biollante may have found
       themselves in deep space, sucked through a black hole and ejected
       from a white hole. The other origin given in Toho canon is that
       Godzilla cells were carried into space by Mothra, and were
       subjected to the black hole/white hole dynamic, while Trendmasters
       [103]Godzilla Wars toyline claimed Godzilla cells were carried into
       space by Mothra and merged with a crystalline entity which then
       resulted in SpaceGodzilla's creation. As a result, SpaceGodzilla
       can be said to be either Biollante's half-brother, her son, or very
       possibly a second 'father', as his cells and appearance more
       closely resemble Godzilla than Biollante.

[[122]edit] Box office

   In Japan, the film sold approximately 2 million tickets, earning
   $7,000,000.

[[123]edit] Critical reaction

   Ed Godziszewski of Monster Zero said the film is "by no means a
   classic" but felt that "for the first time in well over 20 years, a
   [Godzilla] script is presented with some fresh, original ideas and
   themes."^[124][1] Joseph Savitski of Beyond Hollywood said the film's
   music is "a major detraction," but added that it's "not only one of the
   most imaginative films in the series, but also the most enjoyable to
   watch."^[125][2] Japan Hero said, "[T]his is definitely a Godzilla
   movie not to be missed."^[126][3]

[[127]edit] Production

   Godzilla vs. Biollante began as a winner of a contest by Toho. The
   concept was created by Shinichiro Kobayashi, a dentist. His script was
   widely different from the final film, the few parts that remained were
   Erika's death, Biollante's creation, a psychic girl, and for the most
   part, the ending. This first draft also had Dr. Shiragami first create
   a rat/fish hybrid monster named Deutalios who was quickly killed by
   Godzilla. This was cut and replaced by Godzilla's battles with
   Biollante's rose stage and the Super X-II. In another ending, Biollante
   sacrifices herself to defeat Godzilla by turning into a wave of pure
   energy.

[[128]edit] DVD Releases

     * There are currently no stated plans to release Godzilla vs.
       Biollante on Region 1 [129]DVD from [130]Miramax Home
       Entertainment.

     * Toho has released the film several times on DVD in Japan, but as a
       Region 2 release and without English subtitles.

     * There was a Region 3 release by Universe Laser & Video Co. as a
       budget title alongside [131]The Return of Godzilla. It contains
       Japanese and Cantonese audio and also includes English subtitles.
