[[39]edit] History

   Drury was founded as Springfield College in 1873 by
   [40]Congregationalist church missionaries in the mold of other
   Congregationalist universities such as [41]Dartmouth College and
   [42]Yale University. Rev. Nathan Morrison, Samuel Drury, and James and
   Charles Harwood provided the school's initial endowment and
   organization; Samuel Drury's gift was the largest of the group and the
   school was soon renamed in honor of Drury's recently deceased son.

   The early curriculum emphasized educational, religious and musical
   strengths. Students came to the new college from a wide area, including
   the Indian Territories of Oklahoma. The first graduating class included
   four women.

   When classes began in 1873, they were held in a single building on a
   campus occupying less than 1 acres. Twenty-five years later the 40-acre
   (160,000 m^2) campus included Stone Chapel, the Presidents House and
   three academic buildings. Today, the university occupies a 115-acre
   (0.47 km^2) campus, including the original historic buildings.

   Drury College became Drury University on January 1, 2000.^[43][1] In
   addition to the academic programs of the early years, Drury students
   today study in the Breech School of Business Administration, the
   Hammons School of Architecture, and the departments of education,
   mathematics and sciences, social sciences, exercise and sport science.
   The list of majors and minors at Drury has also grown and now includes
   high tech studies in computer science, computer information systems and
   e-commerce.

   The College of Graduate and Continuing Studies serves nearly three
   thousand students in Springfield and at nine branch campuses.^[44][1]

[[45]edit] Religious affiliations

   Since its founding, Drury has been affiliated with the
   Congregationalist church and its successor, the [46]United Church of
   Christ. It has also been affiliated with the [47]Christian Church
   (Disciples of Christ) since the founding of the Drury School of
   Religion in 1909.^[48][2] The religious foundation of the university
   still manifests itself in a faith community on campus.

[[50]edit] Global Perspectives 21

   The Global Perspectives 21 (GP21) program is an interdisciplinary
   curriculum "designed to prepare students for the 21st century by
   providing the breadth of understanding and skills needed in our rapidly
   changing global society."^[51][3] A practical benefit of the program is
   that all traditional Drury day students receive a minor in Global
   Studies for completing their general education requirements.

   Drury explains the program in this way: "The GP21 program is rooted in
   the liberal arts and thus helps develop the knowledge and skills
   associated with a bachelors degree. Students develop their reading,
   writing, and oral communication skills. They extend their abilities to
   think critically and creatively and to solve problems. They explore
   values and ethical issues in many ways and develop a deeper awareness
   of what divides and unite global cultures. This integrated program of
   study thus prepares students for meaningful and successful lives as
   persons and professionals."^[52][3]

[[53]edit] Study Abroad

   Although not directly tied to the GP21 curriculum, Drury's study abroad
   program is an integral part of the college experience. Almost half of
   the student body studies overseas at some point in short-term,
   semester, or year-long programs. Foreign learning is a requirement for
   most students with majors in the schools of Business and Architecture.

   Drury also maintains a satellite campus in [54]Volos, [55]Greece, that
   is home to several of the university's most distinctive courses. Though
   the Center is quite popular with architecture students, it is attended
   by students across disciplines and majors.^[56][4]

[[57]edit] Athletics

   The school was a founding member of the [58]Heartland Conference. In
   the Fall of 2005, the Drury Panthers joined the [59]Great Lakes Valley
   Conference. Drury sponsors NCAA [60]Division II intercollegiate
   athletic teams in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross
   country, men's and women's golf, men's and women's soccer, men's and
   women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's baseball, women's
   softball, and women's volleyball.

   Baseball, in hiatus since the 1970s, was reorganized for the 2007
   season by new Head Coach Mark Stratton. The 2007 team was composed
   mainly of freshmen, with two seniors (Tony Lewis and Brian York) on the
   roster. In the pre-season picks, Drury Baseball was picked to finish
   last in the [61]Great Lakes Valley Conference. However, the Drury
   Panther Baseball team won a bid into their conference tournament. They
   took this opportunity, and went undefeated to become the 2007 Great
   Lakes Valley Conference Champions. This gave them an automatic bid into
   the NCAA Division-II tournament. While they eventually were defeated by
   Grand Valley State (ranked 6th in the nation), the Drury Panthers sent
   home two Great Lakes Intercollegiate Conference teams (Ashland and
   Saginaw Valley State, which out ranked the last seeded Drury), and
   finished third in the NCAA Division-II Regional. Tony Lewis was the
   recipient of the Rawlings Golden Glove Award. Lewis and Joe Rohlfing
   were named to the All-Tournament team for the NCAA Division-II North
   Central Regional. Drury ended the season going 33-24.

   Drury men's swimming head coach Brian Reynolds was recently inducted
   into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.

   Universities (AAC&U) project Shared Futures: General Education for
   Global Learning, which focuses on linking the liberal arts to global
   issues. In the same year [84]John Sellars was appointed president.

   On April 23, 2007, Drury's 15th President John Sellars resigned,
   effective May 31, 2007. He later was named president of [85]Graceland
