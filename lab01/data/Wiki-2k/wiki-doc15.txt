   "Distant Origin" is an episode of [23]Star Trek: Voyager, the 23^rd
   episode of the third season.

[[24]edit] Plot

   Professor Gegen and his assistant, Veer, two Voth [25]palaeontologists,
   make a shocking find on a nearby planet: the skeletal remains of a
   creature whose genome is so closely related to their own that it could
   only have evolved on the same planet as the Voth did.

   It is an individual from a technologically advanced species, judging by
   its synthetic clothing, a gold and black [26]Starfleet uniform with a
   [27]Maquis insignia. (The specific human is Lieutenant Hogan, killed in
   the earlier episode "[28]Basics.") The scientists analyze the bones in
   their lab. The creature was an [29]endotherm, probably a [30]mammal,
   unlike the [31]reptilian Voth. Still, the genetic similarities intrigue
   the scientists and they make a dangerous hypothesis, one which will
   need strong scientific evidence to convince the dogmatic elders of Voth
   society that their theological explanation for the origin of their
   species is not total truth. The archaeologists surmise that the
   creature in their lab evolved on a distant planet, and that the Voth
   evolved on the very same planet. This is the basis of the "Distant
   Origin Theory", one which is not accepted in Voth society because it
   contradicts doctrine that states that the Voth are the "first" race,
   which evolved in the area of space they now occupy and have ruled it
   for many millions of years.

   A few Voth scientists are closet believers in Distant Origin and have
   worked to present evidence that might support their ideas. These
   scientists are considered subversive by many, but Professor Gegen is
   determined to prove Distant Origin, risking his career to bring his
   society out of ignorance and belief in myth.

   Further analysis of the creature's garments and information from
   traders and merchants bring the archaeologists closer to finding the
   crewmates of the endotherm. They seek his ship, Voyager, and its crew,
   which call themselves "humans". Once they track down the ship, Gegen
   and Veer shield themselves and venture on board to observe their
   distant relatives. The humans are certainly mammalian, complete with a
   strange odor and a lack of scales. The scientists observe an intriguing
   courtship ritual between a male ([32]Paris), and a female ([33]Torres).
   The society of the humans is apparently rigidly hierarchical, perhaps a
   [34]matriarchy as evidenced by the dominance of one female
   ([35]Janeway).

   The ship's sensors detect some sort of cloaked intruder on board. The
   crew goes on alert and seeks out the invisible infiltrators.
   [36]Chakotay's phaser set to the right frequency brings the Voth into
   phase, and in a panic, Veer shoots him with a poison dart. [37]Tuvok
   stuns Veer, and Gegen grabs the tranquilized Chakotay and transports
   back to his ship with him, where he plans to study the live human. In
   Sickbay, [38]The Doctor does the same with his patient, who has just
   put himself into a state of [39]hibernation. The Doctor discovers the
   genetic similarity. By running models on the holodeck he and Captain
   Janeway discover that the Voth are descendents of [40]hadrosaurs,
   probably of genus [41]Parasaurolophus.

   There is no time for more research, however, when Voyager is accosted
   and beamed into the belly of a massive city-ship and shut down. It's
   the Voth, who plan to destroy the humans as threats to doctrine.

   The Voth elders take Gegen into custody and put him on trial for
   [42]heresy. Even though he brings Chakotay with him into the courtroom
   as evidence of the genetic link between Voth and human, the head elder,
   Minister Odala, presents findings from obviously doctrine-loyal
   scientists that explain the similarities as random convergence. She
   then introduces the star witness against Gegen, his assistant Veer. The
   younger Voth has been coerced into recanting his claims supporting
   Distant Origin. Odala gives Gegen a chance to recant his as well.

   Odala is disgusted by Gegen's assertions regarding the truthfulness of
   Distant Origin. She notes that the Voth have been spacegoing for so
   many millions of years and have dominated their area of space since
   ancient times; they couldn't possibly be refugee "immigrants" from a
   faraway planet crawling with mammals. Chakotay points out that the
   doctrine of the Voth has been changed many times to conveniently
   explain truth via myth. The minister dismisses this and gives Gegen one
   final chance. He refuses to retract his theories and Odala convicts him
   of heresy and remands him to a prison colony. She then condemns the
   crew of Voyager to the same fate.

   To prevent the imprisonment of the humans, Gegen retracts the science
   he believes so strongly in, and states that he is wrong. Defeated and
   hopeless, he agrees to take a position in another area of research.
   Minister Odala releases Chakotay and demands the humans leave Voth
   space forever. But as Chakotay and Gegen are saying good bye to each
   other, Chakotay presents him with a globe of the Earth. Gegen tells him
   that one day, all Voth will realize that the Earth is their home.
