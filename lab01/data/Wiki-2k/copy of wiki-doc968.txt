   Edwin Fuller Uhl ([9]August 14, [10]1841 [11]May 17, [12]1901) was a
   prominent [13]Michigan [14]lawyer and [15]politician. He served as
   [16]Mayor of [17]Grand Rapids, Michigan, [18]Ambassador to Germany and
   [19]United States Assistant Secretary of State.

   Uhl was born in the township of [20]Rush, New York, the son of David M.
   and Catherine (De Garmo) Uhl. The family moved to a farm near
   [21]Ypsilanti, Michigan in 1844. Uhl graduated from the [22]University
   of Michigan in 1862 and received an M.A. degree from the same
   institution in 1863. He then studied [23]law, gaining admission to the
   Michigan [24]bar in January 1864, and began practice. He would practice
   law alone and in partnerships for the next thirty years.

   On [26]May 1, [27]1865 Uhl married Alice Follett, the daughter of
   Benjamin Follett, a prominent citizen and onetime mayor of Ypsilanti.
   They had four children: Lucy Follett, David Edwin, Alice Edwina and
   Marshall Mortimer.

   In 1870 Uhl was elected Prosecuting Attorney of [28]Washtenaw County
   and served in that office for two years. In 1876 the Uhl family moved
   to [29]Grand Rapids. In 1881 he become president of the Grand Rapids
   National Bank; he remained in that position until 1893, then returned
   to it in 1897. At one time he served as President of the Bar
   Association of Grand Rapids. In 1890 he was elected Mayor of Grand
   Rapids, serving two years.

   In 1893 Uhl was appointed [30]Assistant Secretary of State and moved to
   [31]Washington, DC. From [32]May 28 to [33]June 9, [34]1895, he served
   as Acting Secretary of State by appointment of [35]President Cleveland.
   In 1895 the federal government appointed him to inspect US [36]consular
   offices throughout [37]Europe and in 1896 he was appointed Ambassador
   to Germany, a post he held until 1897, when the Cleveland
   administration and its appointees were replaced. He returned to Grand
   Rapids and resumed his career there until his death four years later.

   He is buried in Highland Cemetery in [38]Ypsilanti, Michigan.
