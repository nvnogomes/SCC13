   Pass laws in [39]South Africa were designed to [40]segregate the
   population and limit severely the movements of the non-white populace.
   This legislation was one of the dominant features of the country's
   [41]apartheid system. Introduced in [42]South Africa in 1923, they were
   designed to regulate movement of black Africans in urban areas. Outside
   designated "[43]homelands", black South Africans had to carry passbooks
   ("dom pas", meaning dumb pass) at all times, documentation proving they
   were authorised to live or move in "White" South Africa.^[44][1]

   The laws also affected other non-white races. Indian people, for
   example, were barred from the [45]Orange Free State.

   These discriminatory regulations sparked outrage from the black
   population and the [46]ANC began the [47]Defiance Campaign to oppose
   the pass laws.

   This conflict climaxed at the [48]Sharpeville Massacre where the black
   opposition was violently put down, with 69 people killed and over 180
   injured.

   The system of pass laws was repealed in South Africa in 1986.

   Pass laws also stated that black Africans could not hold a higher
   business position within a company than the lowest white employee.

   The first pass laws were introduced in 1760 to regulate the movement of
   slaves in the Cape. The Urban Areas Consolidation Act of 1945, together
   with the Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents)
   Act of 1952, were key laws. The Urban Areas Act outlined requirements
   for African peoples' "qualification" to reside legally in white
   metropolitan areas. To do so, they had to have Section 10 rights, based
   on whether
     * the person had been born there and resided there always since
       birth;
     * the person had laboured continuously for ten years in any agreed
       area for any employer, or lived continuously in any such area for
       less than ten years;
     * the person was the spouse, spinster or son under eighteen years of
       age of an African person, falling into the above two categories,
       usually lived with him and had originally entered the area
       legitimately; or
     * the person had been granted a permit to remain by a labour bureau.

[[54]edit] Native Urban Areas Act

   The Native Urban Areas Act 1923 deemed urban areas in South Africa as
   "white" and forced all black African men in cities and towns to carry
   permits called "passes" at all times. Anyone found without a pass would
   be arrested immediately and sent to a rural area.

[[55]edit] Pass Laws Act

   The Pass Laws Act 1952 made it compulsory for all [56]black South
   Africans over the age of 16 to carry a "pass book" at all times. The
   law stipulated where, when, and for how long a person could remain.
   This pass was also known as a dompas.

   The document was similar to an [57]internal passport, containing
   details on the bearer such as their [58]fingerprints, [59]photograph,
   the name of his/her employer, his/her address, how long the bearer had
   been employed, as well as other identification information. Employers
   often entered a behavioural evaluation, on the conduct of the pass
   holder.

   An employer was defined under the law and could be only a [60]white
   person. The pass also documented permission requested and denied or
   granted to be in a certain region and the reason for seeking such
   permission. Under the terms of the law, any governmental employee could
   strike out such entries, basically canceling the permission to remain
   in the area.

   A pass book without a valid entry then allowed officials to arrest and
   imprison the bearer of the pass. These passes often became the most
   despised symbols of [61]apartheid. The resistance to the Pass Law led
   to many thousands of arrests and was the spark that ignited the
   [62]Sharpeville Massacre on [63]21 March [64]1960, and led to the
   arrest of [65]Robert Sobukwe on that same date.
