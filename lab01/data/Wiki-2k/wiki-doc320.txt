   Dr. Who and the Daleks ([33]1965) was the first of two [34]Doctor Who
   films made in the 1960s, and was followed by [35]Daleks - Invasion
   Earth 2150 AD.

   The film features [36]Peter Cushing as [37]Dr. Who, [38]Roberta Tovey
   as Susan, [39]Jennie Linden as Barbara, and noted [40]Carry On star
   [41]Roy Castle as Ian.

   It is based on [42]The Daleks, the second Doctor Who serial (and the
   first to feature the [43]Daleks). Filmed in [44]Technicolor, it is the
   first Doctor Who story to be made in colour and in a widescreen format.
   The television series continued to be made in black-and-white until
   [45]1969, and not in widescreen until the revival of the series.

   The film is generally not considered [46]canon^[[47]citation needed].

[[55]edit] Plot

   [56]Dr. Who (Cushing) and his granddaughters, [57]Susan (Tovey) and
   [58]Barbara (Linden), show Barbara's boyfriend [59]Ian (Castle) the
   Doctor's latest invention, a [60]time machine called [61]Tardis. When
   Ian accidentally activates the machine, it takes them to a
   [62]petrified [63]jungle on a world devastated by an ancient
   [64]nuclear war fought between the [65]Daleks and the [66]Thals.
   (Although the planet is not named in the film, in its sequel it is
   retroactively revealed to be called [67]Skaro, matching the name given
   in the television series.) At the conclusion of the war, the Daleks,
   heavily [68]mutated by [69]radiation, encased themselves in protective
   machines and retreated into their city, while the humanoid Thals
   survived the fallout through the use of an anti-radiation [70]drug and
   became a peaceful race of farmers. However, the Thals' crops have
   recently failed and they have journeyed to the petrified jungle to seek
   help from their former enemies. The Daleks, meanwhile, although
   determined to become the dominant race on Skaro, are unable to leave
   the city due to their vulnerability to radiation and their reliance on
   [71]static electricity to power their machines.

   Ian and Barbara are unnerved by the jungle and demand to return to
   [72]London, but the Doctor, eager to investigate the city, fakes a leak
   in one of the vital Tardis fluid links to trap them on Skaro. The group
   decide to search the city for the [73]mercury needed to refill the link
   but stumble across a case of Thal drug [74]vials as they leave. In the
   city, the Doctor learns from a [75]Geiger counter that the planet is
   radioactive, and, in view of the fact that they are feeling unwell,
   deduces that they are developing [76]radiation sickness. Suddenly, the
   Daleks appear and capture the travellers, confining them to a cell and
   seizing the Doctor's fluid link for inspection.

   The Daleks know of the Thal drug and want to reproduce it in large
   quantities so that they can leave the city and exterminate other races.
   They offer to let the humans use some of the drug to cure their
   sickness if the vials abandoned outside Tardis are brought to the city.
   While carrying out the task, Susan encounters Alydon, the Thal leader
   who left the vials. Alydon gives Susan a secondary drug supply to use
   in case the Daleks deviate from their promise and also lends her his
   plastic cape.

   The Daleks discover Susan's secret drug supply but allow the humans to
   treat themselves with it. They then summon Susan to write a letter to
   the Thals, informing them that they wish to end post-war hostilities
   and will leave food in their control room as an act of friendship.
   However, the adventurers find out that when the Thals come, they will
   actually be ambushed and exterminated.

   When a Dalek comes to the cell to deliver food and water, the Doctor
   and his companions immobilise it by forcing it onto Susan's cape, thus
   [77]insulating it from the charged metal floor. Ian takes the place of
   the creature inside the casing and notifies another Dalek that he is
   taking the Doctor, Barbara and Susan to the control room for
   questioning. Now free, the travellers shout a warning to the Thals who
   are entering the city and escape with them into the jungle, but an
   elderly man, Temmosus, is killed by the Daleks.

   Later, the Daleks test the Thal drug on a number of themselves but find
   that it causes disastrous side effects. With no way of leaving the
   city, they decide to detonate a [78]neutron bomb to increase the
   radiation on Skaro to a point at which not even the Thals can survive.

   At the Thal camp, the Doctor urges Alydon to fight the Daleks for a
   safe future. Alydon insists that the Thals are pacifist, but the Doctor
   tests this claim by ordering Ian to take Dyoni, Alydon's love, to the
   Daleks in exchange for the confiscated fluid link: Alydon punches Ian
   to the ground, proving that Thals will fight for some things. Alydon,
   Susan and the Doctor lead the tribe to the front entrance of the city,
   where they attempt to confuse the enemy's scanners by reflecting light
   off small [79]mirrors to give the impression of greater numbers.
   However, when the Daleks appear, the Thals scatter and Susan and the
   Doctor are captured.

   Meanwhile, Ian and Barbara, guided by Ganatus, Antodus and Elyon, set
   out to infiltrate the city from behind. However, while navigating a
   [80]swamp, Elyon is plucked to his death by marsh-dwelling mutations
   and the party is eventually forced to jump a chasm to proceed any
   further. Antodus falls short and plunges into the void, but manages to
   cling to the uneven rock face and is pulled up by the others.

   In the city control room, the Daleks ignore the Doctor's appeals as
   they start the bomb countdown. Ian, Barbara, Ganatus and Antodus
   penetrate the city and join Alydon and the rest of the Thals, who
   returned in their determination to rescue Susan and the Doctor. The
   Thals and humans enter the control room and struggle with the Daleks
   while Doctor yells for someone to stop the bomb detonation. Ian calls
   out his presence, but dives for cover as the Daleks fire towards him in
   unison. The aliens inadvertently destroy their own control panel,
   disabling themselves as well as freezing the countdown. The Doctor
   retrieves the Tardis fluid link.

   In the jungle, the Thals bid farewell to the Doctor and his companions
   and express their gratitude with special gifts. However, when the
   travellers depart in Tardis, they materialise not in London but on an
   ancient battlefield in front of an advancing army.

[[81]edit] Changes from the television series

   Several changes were made to the main characters. [82]Cushing's Dr. Who
   is an Earth-born scientist and inventor (whose name is actually Who)
   who built [83]Tardis (not the TARDIS as in the television show), his
   [84]time travelling ship. Cushing plays the Doctor as an amiable and
   absent-minded inventor, in contrast to [85]William Hartnell's more
   prickly and mysterious persona, though Cushing's version does show
   leadership and determination in moments of crisis. Barbara and Susan
   are now both his granddaughters. Ian Chesterton is now Barbara's
   bumbling boyfriend, and the entire subplot of them being Susan's
   teachers is dropped. Ian is the comic relief in the film, rather than
   the heroic version seen in [86]The Daleks.

   Because of this departure from the established continuity of the
   television series, this film is generally not considered
   [87]canon^[[88]citation needed], although attempts have been made in
   various [89]spin-off media to fit it in.

[[127]edit] Production

     * In 1995 a documentary, [128]Dalekmania, about the two Dalek films
       was released, it has interesting material about the productions,
       spin-offs, and publicity.^[129][2]
     * The actor [130]Barrie Ingham discussed the production in an
       interview in Australia in 1976 for the Doctor Who fanzine
       [131]Zerinza. ^[132][3]
     * Originally, the Daleks were going to be armed with
       [133]flamethrowers, but these were vetoed (for fear of being too
       frightening, and also for [134]health and safety reasons) and
       replaced with smoke projectors. Flamethrowers were, however, later
       incorporated into the Daleks seen in the TV serial [135]The Daleks'
       Master Plan broadcast later in 1965.
     * The Daleks were slightly redesigned from their appearance in the
       television series. Several of the movie Dalek models were purchased
       by the BBC and used in the serial [136]The Chase. As the film was
       not released until after The Chase, this film actually marks the
       movie Daleks' second appearance.
     * [137]David Whitaker novelised the original television serial in
       1964 as Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks (later
       retitled Doctor Who and the Daleks). Although not strictly a
       novelisation of the film, there are some similiaries in that the
       book has Ian joining the TARDIS crew for the first time as he does
       here (even though he actually joined the Doctor in [138]a previous
       serial in the television version).
     * The Daleks also seemed a lot taller than the TV Daleks, as they had
       some sort of bumpers at the bottom (Possibly to make them more
       menacing because the TV Daleks were small in height).
     * A number of Daleks also had Claws instead of a plunger.
     * Some of the Daleks used for mass scenes and in the background were
       apparently made using fibreglass from moulds, noticeable for the
       slightly different shape of the brass coloured straps around their
       mid-sections.
     * A mass array of Daleks were displayed on the back of a truck at the
       Cannes film festival for publicity, and single Daleks were also
       sent further afield, one making an appearance at the cinema in
       Sydney, Australia, before apparently being thrown out (or "lost").

[[139]edit] Popular Culture

     * There was a colouring-in book for children with colour photographic
       illustrations on the covers.
     * The film style Daleks also appeared in some of the stories in the
       long running Dalek comic strip in the magazine "TV Century 21."
     * In the film [140]Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit
       (co-written by long-time Doctor Who contributor Bob Baker), a
       marquee is briefly seen advertising "Dr. [141]Hoe and the
       [142]Garlics", a reference to this film.
