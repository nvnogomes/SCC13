   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   EnergySolutions is one of the worlds largest processors of [9]low level
   waste (LLW), and is the largest nuclear waste company in the United
   States. EnergySolutions is a publicly traded company NYSE: ES) based in
   [10]Salt Lake City, Utah, although it has operations in 40 states.
   Steve Creamer is the founder and current CEO of the company, which
   formed from the merger of four waste disposal companies: Envirocare,
   Scientech D&D, BNG America, and Duratek. The company took over several
   [11]Magnox atomic plants from [12]British Nuclear Fuels plc in
   [13]United Kingdom on [14]June 7, [15]2007.^[16][1]

   EnergySolutions owns and operates a licensed landfill to dispose of
   radioactive waste in Tooele County, Utah and operates another in
   Barnwell County, South Carolina. The company also possesses technology
   to convert waste into environmentally safe forms, such as durable
   glass, and is contracted by the [17]United States Department of Energy
   to assist in waste conversion efforts.

   The company holds the naming rights to [18]EnergySolutions Arena.

[[24]edit] Creation of EnergySolutions

   Envirocare of [25]Utah purchased the [26]Connecticut-based Scientech
   D&D division in October 2005.^[27][2] On February 2, 2006, Envirocare
   announced the $90 million purchase of BNG America a subsidiary of
   [28]British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) based in [29]Virginia.^[30][3] The
   merged company would change its name to EnergySolutions, with corporate
   headquarters based in [31]Salt Lake City, Utah. On February 7, 2006,
   EnergySolutions announced it would buy [32]Maryland-based Duratek, a
   [33]publicly-traded company, for $396 million in an all-cash
   deal.^[34][4] The [35]leveraged buyout was financed by banks led by
   [36]Citigroup, effectively taking the company private.

   After the acquisitions, EnergySolutions has 2,500 employees in 40
   [37]states with an annual revenue of $280 million.^[38][5]
   Additionally, EnergySolutions owns two of the nation's three commercial
   low-level nuclear-waste repositories, although its primary competitor,
   Waste Control Specialists, hopes to build a fourth repository in Texas.

[[39]edit] Envirocare

   Envirocare was founded by Iranian immigrant Khosrow Semnani in 1988.
   Semnani served as president of the company until May 1997, when
   Envirocare's largest customerthe [40]Department of Energyrequested that
   he step down in the wake of a bribery scandal.^[41][6] Semnani
   allegedly bribed Utah's Division of Radiation Control director, Larry
   B. Anderson, with $600,000 in cash, gifts, and gold coins over several
   years. Semnani alleged that he was extorted by Anderson, and the two
   sued each other in civil court. Semnani agreed to testify against
   Anderson in a plea bargain forcing him to pay a $100,000 fine for
   aiding in the preparation of a false tax return.^[42][7] Anderson was
   convicted to serve 30 months in federal prison on tax charges.

   In mid-December 2004, Semnani sold Envirocare for an undisclosed sum.
   Steve Creamer became the company's new CEO. The deal was financed by
   private equity firms, led by [43]Lindsay Goldberg & Bessemer of New
   York, Creamer Investments, and Peterson Partners both of Salt Lake
   City. Envirocare management promised to drop plans to bury hotter class
   B and C nuclear waste in Utah in deference to developing political
   opposition to the company, which was poised to ban the waste
   anyway.^[44][8] Envirocare's management and ownership was retained as
   it made the acquisitions to become EnergySolutions.

[[45]edit] Duratek

   Based in [46]Columbia, Maryland, Duratek was founded in [47]1983. In
   1990, the company merged with General Technical Services (GTS); the
   resulting company was known as GTS Duratek^[48][9]. That year, the
   company formed a joint venture with another firm Chem-Nuclear Systems,
   Inc. to build a commercial [49]vitrification system.

   In 1997, GTS Duratek acquired the [50]Scientific Ecology Group (SEG).
   In 2000, the company purchased the nuclear services business arm of
   [51]Waste Management Inc.^[52][10] One year later, the company
   announced that it was dropping GTS from its name, and was once again
   known as Duratek.

   Duratek was purchased by EnergySolutions at 25.7% premium over the
   February 7, 2006 stock price when the merger was announced.^[53][4]
