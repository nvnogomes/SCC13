[[34]edit] Early life

   James (Jim) McDaid was born in Termon, [35]County Donegal. He was
   educated in [36]St. Eunan's College, [37]Letterkenny and [38]University
   College, Galway. While at UCG he played on the university soccer team
   that won three national titles, with McDaid captaining the side on two
   of those occasions. Between 1974 and 1979 he worked at [39]Letterkenny
   General Hospital, and in 1979 he went into partnership as a general
   practitioner in Letterkenny. He was also involved as medical officer to
   the [40]Donegal county [41]Gaelic football team.

[[42]edit] Political career

   McDaid was elected to [43]Dil ireann on his first attempt at the
   [44]1989 general election. He remained on the backbenches until 1991
   when he was nominated by [45]Taoiseach [46]Charles Haughey to the
   position of [47]Minister for Defence. On the morning of his
   appointment, however, a photograph emerged taken outside Dublin's
   [48]Four Courts on the day a judge ruled that the [49]Maze escaper,
   James Pius Clarke, should not be [50]extradited to the [51]United
   Kingdom. McDaid was seen in the background, smiling broadly. While
   McDaid stated that his presence at the hearing was due to personal
   connections -- Clarke's mother was a constituent and a patient in his
   general practice in Letterkenny -- the opposition [52]Fine Gael party
   objected to his appointment and ministers from Fianna Fil's coalition
   partners, the [53]Progressive Democrats, indicated their unwillingness
   to remain in office should McDaid be appointed. McDaid handed back his
   portfolio that evening and returned to the backbenches. Following
   [54]Bertie Ahern's election as leader of [55]Fianna Fil in 1994, McDaid
   was appointed to the [56]front bench as spokesperson on Equality and
   Law Reform.

   As a result of this appointment McDaid joined the government in 1997
   when he became Minister for Tourism, Sport & Recreation. During his
   tenure he earned the nickname "the Minister for Fun," however, he
   presided over much more weighty issues such as investigations into
   controversial events such as drugs allegations in sport and sex abuse
   by swimming coaches. Following the [57]2002 general election McDaid
   failed to retain his Cabinet post, but he did become a [58]Minister of
   State. Mc Daid was dropped from the cabinet table because, during the
   2002 general election campaign he stated that anyone who completes
   suicide is a "selfish bastard". He failed to be elected to the
   [59]European Parliament in 2004 and was later sacked from his position
   as Minister of State and returned to the backbenches once again. In
   April 2006, McDaid announced that he would be retiring from public life
   in favour of returning to his medical practice and would not be
   standing in the [60]next general election. However, on 27 July 2006,
   following the announcement that [61]Niall Blaney TD had joined the
   Fianna Fil party, McDaid reversed this decision, and announced that he
   would be seeking nomination as a candidate once again.

[[62]edit] Personal life

   McDaid's private life has long been a source of interest in the Irish
   media. The breakdown of his marriage, and the subsequent publication of
   a book by his ex-wife, revealed the details of their troubled marriage
   and separation.

   In April 2005 McDaid was arrested when found driving drunk in the wrong
   direction on a [63]dual carriageway outside Dublin. Oncoming vehicles
   were forced to swerve to avoid his car, which was eventually force to
   stop when a haulier was forced to block his path. Tests showed a
   [64]blood alcohol level of 267mg, more than three times over the legal
   limit of 80 mg. He was subsequently convicted of dangerous driving
   while intoxicated and [65]drunken driving, banned from driving for 2
   years and fined EUR 750. However he was returned his licence after only
   a year. The case attracted media attention and McDaid was described as
   'a disgrace' and 'an idiot'. He acknowledged that these descriptions
   were accurate, and stated that he was genuinely sorry for his actions.

   Three years earlier, as Junior Transport Minister in November 2002, he
   had spearheaded the Government's anti-drink driving campaign, warning
   that 'some drivers still choose to ignore our drink driving laws, and
   as a result innocent lives are destroyed'.

   He currently lives with his partner, Siobhan O'Donnell, a former
   barmaid, and the couple's son, Neal.

[[66]edit] Politics

   Having previously publicly indicated that politics "no longer holds any
   challenge for him" and that he was to resign from politics at the
   dissolution of the [67]29th Dil, McDaid announced on 27 July 2006 that
   he would seek a nomination to contest the [68]2007 general election.
   [69][1]

   Following the absorption of [70]Independent Fianna Fil and its sole TD,
   [71]Niall Blaney into Fianna Fil, there were then three outgoing
   [72]Fianna Fil [73]Teachta Dla's in this very competitive three-seater
   constituency. Under the [74]Single Transferable Vote proportional
   representation electoral system used in Ireland, it was considered
   virtually impossible for all three to be elected. Fianna Fil duly lost
   one of its three seats to Fine Gael candidate [75]Joe McHugh, with
   McDaid and Blaney being the two successful Fianna Fil candidates.

   Jim McDaid told the [76]Irish Independent on 1 June 2007 that he had
   received no help from Fianna Fil headquarters during the general
   election campaign and that the party had treated him as a virtual
   independent. He warned that, consequently, the party should not take
   his support in the [77]30th Dil for granted. This threat was followed
   through on in November 2008 when he abstained from a vote on the
   [78]HPV vaccine, resulting in his explusion from the Fianna Fail
   parliamentary party ^[79][1]
