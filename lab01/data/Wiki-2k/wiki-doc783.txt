Eowa of Mercia

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Eawa of Mercia)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   "EOWA" redirects here. EOWA may also refer to the [9]Equal Opportunity
   for Women in the Workplace Agency.

   Eowa (or Eawa) was a son of the [10]Mercian king [11]Pybba and a
   brother of the Mercian king [12]Penda; according to the [13]Historia
   Brittonum^[14][1] and the [15]Annales Cambriae.^[16][2] These two
   sources state that Eowa was a king of the Mercians himself at the time
   of the [17]Battle of Maserfield (or Cogwy), in which he was killed, on
   [18]August 5 of what was probably the year 642. The later Mercian kings
   [19]Ethelbald, [20]Offa and [21]Ecgfrith were descended from Eowa; the
   period of their rule began in 716 following the death of Penda's
   grandson [22]Ceolred and ended with Ecgfrith's death in December 796.

   It was in the battle of Maserfield that [23]Oswald of Northumbria was
   defeated and killed by the Mercians under Penda. Eowa also died in this
   battle, although little is known about this. It has been suggested that
   Eowa may have been a co-ruler of the Mercians alongside Penda, or
   possibly even superior in status to Penda at this time (if so, this
   could explain why the Historia Brittonum seems to date Penda's reign
   from the battle of Maserfield), and that he may have been subject to
   Oswald and fighting as his ally in the battle.^[24][3] It is possible
   that it was customary among the Mercians until this time for there to
   be more than one king, and Penda and Eowa may have ruled over the
   southern and northern Mercians respectively.^[25][4]

   Neither [26]Bede, in his [27]Ecclesiastical History of the English
   People, nor the [28]Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mention Eowa's participation
   or death at Maserfield, or his previously being a Mercian king,
   although the Chronicle later mentions him when tracing the descent of
   Ethelbald and Offa.

   Nicholas Brooks wrote that, if Eowa is considered to have ruled during
   the period between roughly 635 and Maserfield, this could account for
   an obscure recorded Welsh raid into Mercian territory, during which it
   is said that no mercy was shown to "book-holding monks". Brooks noted
   that if Eowa was a Northumbrian puppet, there would be the possibility
   that Oswald may have made moves to promote Christianity in Mercia at
   this time, thus accounting for the presence of monks in what was still
   a pagan kingdom. Since Penda is known to history as an ally of the
   Welsh, this along with the presence of monks makes it seem unlikely
   that the raid could have taken place during his rule.^[29][3]

   The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the lineage of Eowa's grandson
   Ethelbald, who ruled from 716 until 757:

          Aethelbald was Alweo's offspring, Alweo Eawa's offspring, Eawa
          Pybba's offspring...^[30][5]

   Later, it gives the lineage of Eowa's great-great-grandson Offa, who
   ruled from 757 to 796 and was descended from Eowa's son Osmod rather
   than Eowa's son Alweo. The descent purportedly extends back to
   [31]Woden:

          That Offa was Thingfrith's offspring, Thingfrith Eanwulf's
          offspring, Eanwulf Osmod's offspring, Osmod Eawa's offspring,
          Eawa Pybba's offspring, Pybba Creoda's offspring, Creoda
          Cynewald's offspring, Cynewald Cnebba's offspring, Cnebba Icel's
          offspring, Icel Eomer's offspring, Eomer Angeltheow's offspring,
          Angeltheow Offa's offspring, Offa Wermund's offspring, Wermund
          Wihtlaeg's offspring, [32]Wihtlaeg Woden's offspring.^[33][6]

   The Historia Brittonum says that Pybba had 12 sons, but that Penda and
   Eowa were the ones best known to him.^[34][7]
