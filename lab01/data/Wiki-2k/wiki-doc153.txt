   - "Don't Worry, Be Happy"
   (1988)

   "Don't Worry, Be Happy" is the title and principal lyric of a [26]song
   by musician [27]Bobby McFerrin. In September of [28]1988, it became the
   first [29]a cappella song to reach number one on the [30]Billboard Hot
   100 chart and held that position for two weeks. On the [31]UK Singles
   Chart, the song reached number 2 during its fifth week on the chart. At
   the [32]1989 Grammy Awards, "Don't Worry Be Happy" won the awards for
   [33]Song of the Year, [34]Record of the Year, and [35]Best Male Pop
   Vocal Performance. The song's title is taken from a famous quote by
   [36]Meher Baba. The original [37]music video stars [38]Robin Williams
   and [39]Bill Irwin. The "instrumentals" in the song are entirely
   composed of sounds made by McFerrin and combined in production. There
   are no instruments used in the song.

   1966 Don't Worry Be Happy inspiration card

[[46]edit] History

   [47]Meher Baba (1894-1969) often used the expression "Don't worry, be
   happy" when cabling his followers in the [48]West.^[49][1] Later, in
   the 1960s, this well used expression by Baba was printed up on
   inspiration cards and posters of the era. In 1988, McFerrin noticed a
   similar poster in the apartment of the jazz band Tuck & Patti in
   [50]San Francisco. Inspired by the expression's charm and simplicity,
   McFerrin wrote the now famous song. In 1988, Bobby McFerrin's hit song,
   "Don't Worry, Be Happy" was included in the soundtrack of the movie
   "[51]Cocktail", and became a hit single the following year. In an
   interview by Bruce Fessier for USA Weekend Magazine in 1988 McFerrin
   said, "Whenever you see a poster of Meher Baba, it usually says 'Don't
   worry, be happy,' which is a pretty neat philosophy in four words, I
   think."^[52][2]

[[53]edit] Covers and alternative versions

   Versions of "Don't Worry, Be Happy" have been recorded by several
   artists. The [54]Katsimiha Brothers made a [55]Greek cover of the song
   with original lyrics, and Montenegrin musician [56]Rambo Amadeus made a
   parody entitled "Don't Happy, Be Worry," as a critique to the optimism
   of the music scene in the former Yugoslavia in the face of war and
   economic depression. The lyrics of "[57]Fight the Power" by hip-hop
   artists [58]Public Enemy also reference "Don't Worry, Be Happy".
   Contrary to mistaken labeling on the internet,^[[59]citation needed]
   Bob Marley never sung this song, as he died 7 years before its release.

[[60]edit] Usage in films and television

   The song, and its title are commonly repeated in US culture. Comedian
   [61]George Carlin wrote in [62]Napalm and Silly Putty that many
   Americans would embrace the philosophy of denial in the song. The song
   was used in [63]George H. W. Bush's [64]1988 U.S. presidential election
   campaign until McFerrin, who was a Democrat, objected and the campaign
   desisted.^[65][3] The song is frequently used in film and television
   soundtracks to accompany light-hearted scenes, such as in [66]Flushed
   Away (2006), [67]WALL-E (2008), [68]The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,
   [69]The Simpsons, [70]Futurama and [71]That 70s Show. It has also been
   used in an ironic context for shocking or traumatic scenes, such as in
   [72]Dawn of the Dead (2004) and [73]Jarhead (2005). The song has been
   used in various forms in TV advertising for brands including [74]Alamo
   Rent A Car, [75]Walkers and [76]Huggies.
