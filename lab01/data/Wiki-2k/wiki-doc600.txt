   Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann ([28]January 24, [29]1776 [30]June 25,
   [31]1822), better known by his [32]pen name E.T.A. Hoffmann (Ernst
   Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann), was a [33]German [34]Romantic [35]author of
   [36]fantasy and [37]horror, a [38]jurist, [39]composer, [40]music
   critic, [41]draftsman and [42]caricaturist. He is the subject and hero
   of [43]Jacques Offenbach's famous but fictional opera [44]The Tales of
   Hoffmann.

   Hoffmann's stories were tremendously influential in the 19th century,
   and he is one of the key authors of [45]the Romantic movement.

[[65]edit] Life

[[66]edit] Youth

   Hoffmann's ancestors, both maternal and paternal, were [67]jurists. His
   father, Christoph Ludwig Hoffmann (173697) was a [68]barrister in
   [69]Knigsberg, [70]Prussia, and also a poet and amateur musician who
   played the [71]viola da gamba. In 1767 he married his cousin Lovisa
   Albertina Doerffer (174896). Ernst Theodor Wilhelm, born on [72]January
   24, [73]1776, was the youngest of three children, of whom the second
   died in infancy.

   His parents separated in 1778, the father going to [74]Insterburg (now
   Chernyakhovsk) with his elder son, Johann Ludwig Hoffmann (1768after
   1822), while Ernst's mother stayed in Knigsberg with her relatives: two
   aunts, Johanna Sophie Doerffer (1745-1803) and Charlotte Wilhelmine
   Doerffer (c. 1754-79) and their brother, Otto Wilhelm Doerffer
   (17411811), who were all unmarried. This trio took it upon themselves
   to educate the youngster.

   The household, dominated by the uncle (whom Ernst nicknamed O Weh or
   "Oh dear" in a play on his initials), was pietistic and uncongenial.
   Hoffmann was to regret his estrangement from his father. Nevertheless,
   he remembered his aunts with great affection, especially the younger,
   Charlotte, whom he nicknamed Tante Fchen ("Aunt Littlefeet"). Although
   she died when he was only three years old, he treasured her memory
   (e.g. see Kater Murr) and embroidered stories about her to such an
   extent that later biographers sometimes assumed her to be imaginary,
   until proofs of her existence were found after [75]World War
   II.^[76][1]

   Between 1781 and 1792 he attended the Lutheran school or Burgschule,
   where he made good progress in classics. He was taught drawing by one
   Saemann, and counterpoint by a Polish organist named Podbileski, who
   was to be the prototype of Abraham Liscot in Kater Murr. Ernst showed
   great talent for piano-playing, and busied himself with writing and
   drawing. The provincial setting was not, however, conducive to
   technical progress, and despite his many-sided talents he remained
   relatively ignorant, both of classical forms and of the new artistic
   ideas that were then developing in Germany. He had however read
   [77]Schiller, [78]Goethe, [79]Swift, [80]Sterne, [81]Rousseau, and
   [82]Jean Paul, and wrote part of a novel called Der Geheimnisvolle.

   Around 1787 he became friends with Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel
   (1775-1843), the son of a pastor and nephew of [83]Theodor Gottlieb von
   Hippel, the well-known writer friend of [84]Immanuel Kant. In 1792,
   both attended some of Kant's lectures at the [85]University of
   Knigsberg. Their friendship, although often tested by a widening social
   gulf, was to be life-long.

   In 1794, Hoffmann fell in love with Dora Hatt, a married woman to whom
   he had given music lessons. She was ten years older, and in 1795 gave
   birth to her sixth child. In February 1796, her family protested
   against his attentions, and, with his faltering consent, they asked
   another of his uncles to arrange employment for him in [86]Glogau
   (Gogw), [87]Prussian Silesia.^[88][2]

[[89]edit] The provinces

   From 1796 Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann
   Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After
   passing further examinations he visited [90]Dresden, where he was
   amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of
   [91]Correggio and [92]Raphael. In the summer of 1798 his uncle was
   promoted to a court in [93]Berlin, and the three of them moved there in
   August Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that
   Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an
   operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen [94]Luise of
   Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of
   the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter
   responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of exams and had already
   left for [95]Posen (Pozna) in [96]South Prussia in the company of his
   old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the
   gallery.

   From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of
   [97]Greater Poland and [98]Masovia. This was the first time he had
   lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to
   become "what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call
   dissolute." His first job, at Posen, was put in jeopardy after Carnival
   on [99]Shrove Tuesday 1802, when caricatures of military officers were
   distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them,
   and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant
   to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by
   "promoting" Hoffmann to [100]Pock in [101]New East Prussia, the former
   capital of Poland (1079-1138) where administrative offices were moved
   from [102]Thorn (Toru). He visited the place to arrange lodging, before
   returning to Posen where he married "Mischa" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla
   Michalina Rorer, whose [103]Polish surname was Trzciska). They moved to
   Pock in August 1802.

   Hoffmann despaired over his exile, and drew caricatures of himself
   drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. One of his tasks was to
   devise surnames for [104]Jews. He found some poetic ones like Goldbaum
   and Apfelbaum. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing
   and composing. He started a diary on [105]1 October [106]1803. An essay
   on the theatre was published in [107]Kotzebue's periodical, Die
   Freimthige, and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write
   a play. Hoffmann's was called Der Preis ("The Prize"), and was itself
   about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but
   none was judged worthy of the award: 100 [108]Friedrichs d'or.
   Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise. ^[109][3] This was
   one of the few high points in a sad period in his life, which saw the
   deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Dora
   Hatt in Knigsberg.

   At the beginning of 1804 he obtained a post at [110]Warsaw. On his way
   there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Dora Hatt's
   daughters. He was never to return to Knigsberg.

[[111]edit] Warsaw

   Hoffmann assimilated well in Polish society; the years spent in
   Prussian Poland he recognized as the happiest in his life. In Warsaw he
   found the same atmosphere he had enjoyed in Berlin, renewing his
   friendship with [112]Zacharias Werner, and meeting his future
   biographer, a neighbour and fellow jurist called Julius Eduard Itzig
   (who changed his name to Hitzig after his baptism). Itzig had been a
   member of the Berlin literary group called the Nordstern, and he gave
   Hoffmann the works of [113]Novalis, [114]Ludwig Tieck, [115]Achim von
   Arnim, [116]Clemens Brentano, [117]Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert,
   [118]Carlo Gozzi, and [119]Calderon. These relatively late
   introductions marked his work profoundly.

   He moved in the circles of [120]August Wilhelm Schlegel, [121]Adelbert
   von Chamisso, [122]Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu, [123]Rahel Levin, and
   [124]David Ferdinand Koreff.

   Unfortunately, his fortunate position was not to last: on [125]28
   November [126]1806 during the [127]War of the Fourth Coalition,
   [128]Napoleon Bonaparte's troops liberated Warsaw, and the Prussian
   bureaucrats lost their positions at a stroke. They divided the contents
   of the treasury between them and fled. In January 1807 his wife and
   two-year-old daughter Ccilia returned to Posen, while he pondered
   whether to move to [129]Vienna or go back to Berlin. A delay of six
   months was caused by severe illness. Eventually the French authorities
   demanded that all former officials swear allegiance or leave the
   country. As they refused to grant him a passport to Vienna, he was
   forced to return to Berlin. He visited his family in Posen before
   arriving in Berlin on [130]18 June [131]1807, hoping to further his
   career there as an artist and writer.

[[132]edit] Berlin and Bamberg

   The next fifteen months were some of the worst in Hoffmann's life. The
   city of Berlin was also occupied by Napoleon's troops, and it was in
   vain that he tried to pick up the pieces. Obtaining only meagre
   allowances, he had frequent recourse to his friends, constantly
   borrowing money and still going hungry for days at a time; he learned
   that his daughter had died. Nevertheless, he managed to compose his Six
   Canticles for a cappella choir: one of his best compositions, which he
   would later attribute to Kreisler in Lebensansichten des Katers Murr.

   On [133]1 September [134]1808 he arrived with his wife in [135]Bamberg,
   where he took up a position as theatre manager. The director, Count
   Soden, left almost immediately for Wrzburg, leaving a man named
   Heinrich Cuno in charge. Hoffmann was unable to improve standards of
   performance, and his efforts led to intrigues against him which
   resulted in him losing his job to Cuno. He began work as music critic
   for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, a newspaper in [136]Leipzig,
   and his articles on [137]Beethoven were especially well received, and
   highly regarded by the composer himself. It was in its pages that the
   "[138]Kapellmeister [139]Johannes Kreisler" character made his first
   appearance.

   Hoffmann's breakthrough came in 1809, with the publication of Ritter
   Gluck, a story about a man who meets, or believes he has met, the
   composer [140]Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-87) more than twenty
   years after the latter's death. The theme alludes to the work of
   [141]Jean Paul, who coined the term [142]Doppelgnger the previous
   decade, and continued to exact a powerful influence over Hoffmann,
   becoming one of his earliest admirers. With this publication, Hoffmann
   began to use the pen name E. T. A. Hoffmann, telling people that the
   "A" stood for Amadeus, in homage to the composer [143]Wolfgang Amadeus
   Mozart (175691). However, he continued to use Wilhelm in official
   documents throughout his life, and the initials E. T. W. also appear on
   his gravestone.

   The next year, he was employed at the Bamberg Theatre as stagehand,
   decorator, and playwright, while also giving private music lessons. He
   fell so deeply in love with a young singing student, Julia Marc, that
   his feelings were obvious whenever they were together, and Julia's
   mother quickly found her a more suitable match. When Joseph Seconda
   offered Hoffmann a position as musical director for his opera company
   (then performing in Dresden), he accepted, leaving on [144]21 April
   [145]1813.

[[146]edit] Dresden and Leipzig

   Prussia had declared war against France on [147]16 March during the
   [148]War of the Sixth Coalition, and their journey was fraught with
   difficulties. They arrived on the 25th, only to find that Seconda was
   in Leipzig; on the 26th, they sent a letter pleading for temporary
   funds. That same day Hoffmann was surprised to meet Hippel, whom he had
   not seen in nine years.

   The situation deteriorated, and in early May Hoffmann tried in vain to
   find transport to Leipzig. On [149]8 May, the bridges were destroyed,
   and his family were marooned in the city. During the day, Hoffmann
   would roam, watching the fighting with curiosity. Finally, on [150]20
   May, they left for Leipzig, only to be involved in an accident which
   killed one of the passengers in their coach and injured his wife.

   They arrived on [151]23 May, and Hoffmann started work with Seconda's
   orchestra, which he found to be of the highest quality. On [152]4 June
   an armistice began, which allowed the company to return to Dresden. But
   on [153]22 August, after the end of the armistice, the family was
   forced to move from their pleasant house in the suburbs into the town,
   and over the next few days the [154]Battle of Dresden raged. The city
   was bombarded; many people were killed by bombs directly in front of
   him. After the main battle was over, he visited the gory battlefield.
   His account can be found in Vision auf dem Schlachtfeld bei Dresden.
   After a long period of continued disturbance the town surrendered on
   [155]11 November, and on [156]9 December the company travelled to
   Leipzig.

   On [157]25 February Hoffmann quarrelled with Seconda, and the next day
   he was given notice of twelve weeks. When asked to accompany them on
   their trip to Dresden in April, he refused, and they left without him.
   But in July his friend Hippel visited, and soon he found himself being
   guided back into his old career as a jurist.

[[158]edit] Berlin

   Grave of E. T. A. Hoffmann. Translated, the inscription reads: E. T. W.
   Hoffmann, born on January 24th, 1776, in Knigsberg, died on June 25th,
   1822, in Berlin, Counsillor of the Court of Justice, excellent in his
   office, as a poet, as a musician, as a painter, dedicated by his
   friends.

   At the end of September 1814, in the wake of Napoleon's defeat,
   Hoffmann returned to Berlin and succeeded in regaining a position at
   the Kammergericht, the chamber court. His opera [159]Undine was
   performed by the Berlin Theatre. Its successful run came to an end only
   after a fire on the night of the 25th performance. Magazines clamoured
   for his contributions, and after a while his standards started to
   decline. Nevertheless, many masterpieces date from this time.

   The period from 1819 saw Hoffmann embroiled in legal disputes, while
   battling ill health. Alcohol abuse and syphilis led eventually to
   weakening of the limbs in 1821, and paralysis from the beginning of
   1822. His last works were dictated to his wife or to a secretary.

   [160]Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich's anti-liberal crusades began
   to put Hoffmann in situations that tested his conscience. Thousands of
   people were accused of treason for having certain political opinions,
   and university professors were monitored during their lectures.

   King [161]Frederick William III of Prussia appointed an Immediate
   Commission for the investigation of political dissidence; when he found
   its observance of the rule of law too frustrating, he established a
   Ministerial Commission to interfere with its processes. The latter was
   greatly influenced by Commissioner Kamptz. During the trial of
   [162]"Turnvater" Jahn, the founder of the gymnastics association
   movement, Hoffmann found himself crossing the will of Kamptz, and
   became a political target. When Hoffmann caricatured Kamptz in a story
   (Meister Floh), Kamptz began legal proceedings. These petered out when
   Hoffmann's illness was seen to be life-threatening. The King asked for
   a reprimand only, but no action was ever taken. Eventually Meister Floh
   was published with the offending passages removed.

   Hoffmann died in Berlin on [163]25 June [164]1822 at the age of 46, and
   is buried near the Hallesches Tor in the Jerusalem and New Churches
   Community Cemetery.

[[181]edit] Nutcracker

   The [182]White House 2003 [183]Christmas decoration using E. T. A.
   Hoffmann's Nutcrackers as the theme.

   Hoffmann wrote novels and short stories, and he composed music,
   including an [184]opera, [185]Undine (1814). However, when reading the
   original text of E. T. A. Hoffmann's stories, one soon realizes that
   these stories were conceived and written at a very sensitive time
   politically. Comparable messages were expressed in earlier animal
   stories such as [186]Reinicke Fuchs or [187]Aesop's Fables. His most
   familiar story is Nussknacker und Mauseknig ("[188]The Nutcracker and
   the Mouse King", 1816), which inspired [189]Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's
   ballet [190]The Nutcracker (1892). His story [191]Der Sandmann ("The
   Sandman", 1816) similarly inspired [192]Delibes's ballet [193]Copplia
   (1870).

   The Nutcracker story is full of charming mimed phantasies with Marie
   (Clara in the ballet), Fritz and Pate Drosselmayr, the mean Mouse King
   and the popular Nutcracker. Many versions of the story have been
   published as children's books. Nutcracker performances have become a
   yearly feature in many cities around Christmas. Yet these stories, as
   with the majority of his literary work, point beyond themselves in
   philosophical terms; Hoffmann invariably moves into territory where an
   exploration of the nature of Selfhood, Art and value-judgements are
   required in order for the reader to enjoy Hoffmann's writings more
   fully. Stories are, in their various media, the ultimate form of
   self-definition and world-interpretation; it is through stories that
   Hoffmann expresses his aesthetic, ethical and political concerns.
   Moreover, the original Hoffmann stories (including the Nutcracker)
   often have dark themes.

[[194]edit] Assessment

   Hoffmann is one of the best-known representatives of [195]German
   Romanticism, and a pioneer of the [196]fantasy genre, with a taste for
   the [197]macabre combined with [198]realism that influenced such
   authors as [199]Edgar Allan Poe (18091849), [200]Nikolai Gogol
   (18091852), [201]Charles Dickens (18121870), [202]Charles Baudelaire
   (18211867), [203]Fyodor Dostoevsky (18211881), and [204]Franz Kafka
   (18831924). Hoffmann's story [205]Das Frulein von Scuderi is sometimes
   cited as the first [206]detective story and a direct influence on Poe's
   "[207]The Murders in the Rue Morgue".^[208][4]

   Hoffmann's work illuminates the darker side of the human spirit found
   behind the hypocritical harmony of [209]bourgeois life, yet his
   wide-ranging influence upon and creative significance within the later
   German romantic period is frequently underestimated. The
   twentieth-century Russian literary theorist [210]Mikhail Bakhtin
   characterised Hoffmann's works as [211]Menippea, essentially satirical
   and self-parodying in form, thus placing him in a tradition that
   includes [212]Cervantes, [213]Diderot and [214]Voltaire.

   [215]Robert Schumann's piano suite [216]Kreisleriana (1838) takes its
   title from one of Hoffmann's books (and according to [217]Charles
   Rosen's The Romantic Generation, is possibly also inspired by "The Life
   and Opinions of Tomcat Murr", in which Kreisler appears). [218]Jacques
   Offenbach's masterwork, the opera [219]Les contes d'Hoffmann ("The
   Tales of Hoffmann", 1881), is based on the stories [220]Der Sandmann
   ("The Sandman", 1816), [221]Rat Krespel ("Councillor Krespel", 1818),
   and Das verlorene Spiegelbild ("The Lost Reflection") from [222]Die
   Abenteuer der Silvester-Nacht ("The Adventures of New Year's Eve",
   1814). [223]Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet [224]The Nutcracker
   (1892) is based on "Nutcracker and Mouse King".

   Hoffmann also influenced 19th century musical taste directly through
   his music criticism. His reviews of [225]Beethoven's [226]Symphony No.
   5 in C minor, Op. 67 (1808) and other important works set new literary
   standards for writing about music, and encouraged later writers to see
   music as "the most Romantic of all the arts." Hoffmann's reviews were
   first collected for modern readers by [227]Friedrich Schnapp, ed., in
   E.T.A. Hoffmann: Schriften zur Musik; Nachlese (1963) and have been
   made available in an English translation in E.T.A. Hoffmann's Writings
   on Music, Collected in a Single Volume (2004).

   Hoffmann strove for artistic polymathy. He created far more in his
   works than mere political commentary achieved through satire. His
   masterpiece (it is generally agreed) is [228]Lebensansichten des Katers
   Murr ("The Life and Opinions of Tomcat Murr", 18191821). This novel
   deals with such issues as the aesthetic status of 'true' artistry, and
   the modes of self-transcendence that accompany any genuine endeavour to
   create. Hoffmann's portrayal of the character Kreisler (a genius
   musician) is wittily counterpointed with the character of the tomcat
   Murr a virtuoso illustration of artistic pretentiousness that many of
   Hoffmann's contemporaries found offensive and subversive of Romantic
   ideals.

   Hoffmann's literature points to the failings of many so-called artists
   to differentiate between the superficial and the authentic aspects of
   such Romantic ideals. The self-conscious effort to impress must,
   according to Hoffmann, be divorced from the self-aware effort to
   create. This essential duality in Kater Murr is structurally conveyed
   through a discursive 'splicing together' of two biographical
   narratives. Such a framework warrants an extensive exploration of its
   philosophical implications.

     * [230]Robertson Davies invokes Hoffmann as a character (with the pet
       name of 'ETAH') trapped in Limbo, within his novel [231]The Lyre of
       Orpheus (1988).
     * [232]Andrew Crumey's novel Mobius Dick also mentions Hoffmann, and
       specifically The Life and Opinions of Tomcat Murr.
     * [233]Angela Carter - [234]The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor
       Hoffman (1972)
     * [235]Alexandre Dumas, pre referenced Hoffmann in [236]The Count of
       Monte Cristo.
     * The exotic and supernatural elements in the storyline of
       [237]Ingmar Bergman's 1982 film [238]Fanny and Alexander derive
       largely from the stories of Hoffmann.
     * [239]Andrei Tarkovsky wrote a script entitled Hoffmaniana in which
       the writer himself is the main protagonist. Unfortunately, due to
       Tarkovsky's premature death, the film was never made.
