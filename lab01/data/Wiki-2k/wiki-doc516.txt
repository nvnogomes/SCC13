   German Weibier

   Wheat beer is a [9]beer that is [10]brewed with a significant
   proportion of [11]wheat. Wheat beers often also contain a significant
   proportion of [12]malted [13]barley. Wheat beers are usually
   [14]top-fermented (in Germany they have to be by law).^[15][1] The
   flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific
   style.

[[25]edit] Varieties

   Two common varieties of wheat beer are witbieren ("white beers") based
   on the [26]Belgian tradition of using flavourings such as [27]coriander
   and [28]orange peel,^[29][2] and Weibiere (German - "white beers")
   based on the [30]German tradition of mixing at least 50% wheat to
   barley malt to make a light coloured ale.^[31][3] Both the Belgian
   [32]witbier and the German Weibier were termed "white beers" because
   historically they were paler than other beers at the time.

   Belgian white beers often have spices such as [33]coriander or
   [34]bitter orange peel added, giving them a slightly fruity flavour.
   They are also often made with raw unmalted wheat, as opposed to the
   malted wheat used in other varieties.

   German wheat beers are called Weizen ("wheat") in the western
   ([35]Baden-Wrttemberg) and northern regions, and Weibier or Weie
   ("white beer" or "white") in [36]Bavaria. Hefeweizen ("hefe" is German
   for yeast) is the name for unfiltered wheat beers, while Kristallweizen
   ("kristall" is German for crystal) is the same beer filtered.

   [37]Breweries in other countries, particularly the [38]U.S. and
   [39]Canada, will brew wheat beers based on these two main traditions
   using special wheat yeasts; however, other varieties of wheat beer are
   also brewed with ordinary ale yeast, which produces a less fruity taste
   than the Bavarian styles^[40][4].

   Sour ales such as [41]Berliner Weie, [42]Gose, and [43]Lambic are made
   with a significant proportion of wheat.

   In [44]Britain, wheat beer is not considered traditional, but several
   brewers produce cask-conditioned varieties, such as, [45]Fuller's
   Discovery, [46]Oakleaf Eichenblatt Bitte, [47]Hoskins White Dolphin,
   [48]Fyfe Weiss Squad and [49]Oakham White Dwarf. British wheat beer
   tends to be a hybrid of the continental style with an English bitter,
   rather than an exact emulation.^[50][5]^[51][6]

   Wheat beers are commonly marketed as spring or summer seasonal
   products.

[[52]edit] Weissbier

          Main article: [53]Weissbier

   Weissbier (or Weibier), as it is called in German, refers to several
   different types of wheat beer. The term Hefeweizen refers to wheat beer
   in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term Kristallweizen (crystal
   wheat), or Kristall Weibier (crystal wheat beer), refers to a wheat
   beer that is [54]filtered to remove the yeast from suspension.
   Additionally, the filtration process removes wheat proteins present in
   the beer which contribute to its cloudy appearance.

   Weissbier is available in a number of other stronger forms including;
   Dunkelweizen (dark wheat), and Weizenstarkbier (strong wheat beer),
   commonly referred to as Weizenbock. The dark wheat varieties typically
   have a much higher alcohol content than their lighter cousins.

   Alternate terms for Hefeweizen include: Hefeweibier, Weibier, Hefeweie,
   Dunkelweizen, Weizenbock, or Weizenstarkbier. A Weizenbock is not
   necessarily considered a Hefeweizen unless it is left unfiltered.

   The Hefeweizen style is particularly noted for its low hop bitterness
   (about 15 [55]IBUs) and relatively high carbonation (approaching four
   volumes), considered important to balance the beer's relatively malty
   sweetness.

   Another balancing flavour note unique to Hefeweizen beer is its
   phenolic character; its signature phenol is [56]4-vinyl guaiacol, a
   metabolite of [57]ferulic acid, the result of fermentation by ale yeast
   appropriate for the style. Hefeweizen's phenolic character has been
   described as "clove" and "medicinal" ("Band-aid") but also smoky. Other
   more typical but less assertive ale flavour notes include "banana"
   ([58]amyl acetate), "bubble gum", and sometimes "vanilla"
   ([59]vanillin).

   Some prominent commercial examples of Hefeweizen are produced by
   [60]Paulaner, [61]Erdinger, [62]Schneider Weisse (original amber only),
   [63]Franziskaner, [64]Schweiger, [65]Hacker-Pschorr, [66]Ayinger (Bru
   Weisse) and [67]Weihenstephaner. The style is nowadays drunk throughout
   Germany, but is especially popular in its Southern German homeland.

[[68]edit] Witbier

   Witbier, White beer, (French: bire blanche), or simply Witte is a
   barley/wheat, top-fermented [69]beer brewed mainly in [70]Belgium,
   although there are also examples in the [71]Netherlands and elsewhere.
   It gets its name due to suspended yeast and wheat proteins which cause
   the beer to look hazy, or white, when cold. It is a descendant from
   those Medieval beers which were not brewed with [72]hops, but instead
   flavoured and preserved with a blend of spices and other plants
   referred to as "[73]gruit". It therefore still uses gruit, although
   nowadays the gruit consists mainly of [74]coriander, [75]orange,
   [76]bitter orange, and hops. The taste is therefore only slightly
   hoppish, and is very refreshing in summer. The beers have a somewhat
   [77]sour taste due to the presence of [78]lactic acid.^[79][7] ^[80][8]
   The suspensed yeast in the beer causes some continuing fermentation in
   the bottle.

   Witbier differs from other varieties of wheat beer in the use of
   [81]gruit. French laws (the territory was French in the 14th century)
   prohibited the use of hops in gruit. Witbier can be made with [82]raw
   wheat, in addition to wheat [83]malt.^[84][9] ^[85][7]

[[86]edit] Sour varieties

          Main articles: [87]Berliner Weie and [88]Lambic

   A minor variety of wheat beer is represented by Berliner Weie (Berlin
   White), which is low in alcohol (2.5% to 3% ABV) and quite tart.
   Although it can be imbibed by itself, enthusiasts often add sweetened
   syrups of [89]lemon, [90]raspberry, or [91]woodruff herb into the beer.

   A very similar light beer variety of the Rhineland, near [92]Cologne,
   called Wei ("white") is now almost extinct.

   Leipziger [93]Gose is similar to Berliner Weie but slightly stronger at
   around 4% ABV. Its ingredients include coriander and salt, which means
   it does not comply with the [94]Reinheitsgebot. Both [95]Gose and
   [96]Berliner Weie acquire their sourness through the use of lactic acid
   bacteria in the fermentation in addition to yeast.

   The Belgian Lambic is also made with wheat and barley, but differs from
   witbier in its yeast. Lambic is a brew of spontaneous [97]fermentation.

[[98]edit] Names and types of wheat beer

   German Kristallweibier (left) and Hefeweibier (right) from [99]Erdinger
   Weibru

   According to the place in which the beer is brewed and small variations
   on the recipe, several different names are used for wheat beer:
     * Weibier, short Weie': these terms are used almost exclusively in
       the southern German state of [100]Bavaria. "Wei" is German for
       "white".
     * Weizenbier, short Weizen: these names are used to indicate the same
       thing. "Weizen" is German for "wheat".
     * Hefeweibier or Hefeweizen: "Hefe" is the German word for yeast. The
       prefix is added to indicate that the beer is
       [101]bottle-conditioned (unfiltered) and thus, might have sediment.
     * Kristallweibier or Kristallweizen: if the weibier is filtered, the
       beer will look "clear" (or "kristall").
     * Dunkles Weibier or Dunkles Weizen: a dark version of a wheat beer
       ("dunkel" is the German word for "dark").
     * Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the [102]bock [103]style
       originating in [104]Germany. An example of this style is Aventinus,
       made by the [105]G. Schneider & Sohn [106]brewery in [107]Kelheim,
       Germany.
     * [108]Witbier or simply Wit: Dutch language name for the Belgian
       style of wheat beer.
     * Bire blanche or blanche: French language name for these beers.

[[109]edit] Serving wheat beer

   Bavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in half-liter, vase-shaped
   glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 25cl glass, however
   there is no standard shape. Berliner Weisse is often served in a
   schooner.

   Kristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat
   beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon in the glass; this is
   generally frowned upon in Bavaria. ^[110][1]
