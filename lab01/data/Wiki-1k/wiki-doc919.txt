   Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory is the fifth studio album by
   [42]American [43]progressive metal band [44]Dream Theater, released in
   [45]1999. It is a [46]concept album that deals with the story of a man
   named Nicholas and the discovery of his past life, which involves
   [47]love, [48]murder, and [49]infidelity as Victoria Page. It was
   recorded at BearTracks Studios in New York, where the band had
   previously recorded their second album [50]Images and Words and the EP
   [51]A Change Of Seasons.

   The album is the sequel to "[52]Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the
   Sleeper", a song previously featured on [53]Images and Words. Critical
   and commercial reaction to the album was extremely favorable, as many
   fans and critics alike view the album as the band's masterpiece. It was
   also the first album to feature [54]Jordan Rudess on keyboards, and the
   last album (as yet) for which [55]John Myung has written lyrics for a
   song.

[[85]edit] History

   After playing with keyboardist Jordan Rudess in [86]Liquid Tension
   Experiment, a supergroup composed of various members of famous
   [87]progressive rock bands and finding themselves writing music and
   working together quite easily, drummer Mike Portnoy and guitarist John
   Petrucci convinced the band to offer Rudess the position of full-time
   keyboardist for the band's upcoming album. He accepted, and current
   keyboardist [88]Derek Sherinian was fired from the band via a
   [89]conference call between the four members in New York and him in Los
   Angeles (Portnoy and Petrucci have stated that while it was an
   uncomfortable and unattractive situation, they didn't want to ask Derek
   to fly out from L.A. to New York only to be fired). After his
   departure, the band went back to BearTracks Studios in New York City to
   record their new album, previously the site of recording for [90]Images
   and Words. (A photograph of Beartracks Studios is featured on the
   album's back cover, meant to represent the house in the album.) After
   the commercial failure of [91]Falling into Infinity, their record label
   gave the band free rein over their new album's direction, which led the
   band to finally finish the story begun with "Metropolis, Pt. 1" from
   [92]Images and Words.

   The album's recording was kept secretive, to keep fans from meddling
   with the band's recording, and to surprise them. Fans had previously
   requested the band to make the sequel to the first part, but they had
   not yet been able. The band thought that the surprise would delight
   their fans, thus the secretive nature of the recording. However,
   shortly before the album's release, the track list and release date
   were leaked onto the internet against the band's wishes.

   The album was released in September 1999 to wide critical and
   commercial success. The band then embarked on a massive world tour, and
   at a show in New York City the band actually hired actors to perform
   the album live while they were playing the music in the background. The
   performance was recorded and was released in 2001 as the [93]Metropolis
   2000 Live DVD. To the band's dismay, their documents of the
   performances for the album were burdened by the Live CD's release date,
   [94]September 11, 2001. The album's cover also featured pictures of the
   [95]World Trade Center with a flame above them. The unfortunate
   occurrence resulted in the band changing the album's cover shortly
   after release. However, some copies with the original artwork were
   sold, which have since become highly sought after by fans.

   The album was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of [96]Guitar
   World magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time
   ^[97][1].

   Roughly half of the songs on the album was used for the soundtrack of
   the American version of [98]The History of Trunks, a [99]Dragon Ball Z
   TV Special.

[[104]edit] Act 1

[[105]edit] Scene One: Regression

   The album opens with Nicholas relaxing to the sounds of the
   Hypnotherapist's voice and entering a [106]hypnotic state in the
   pursuit of [107]regression therapy. A part of "The Spirit Carries On"
   can be faintly heard in the background at one point. The track ends
   with Nicholas greeting a girl named Victoria.

[[108]edit] Scene Two: I. Overture 1928

   Nicholas is in a hypnotic trance and marvelling at the surreal peace
   and comfort. As he settles into his trance, he begins to focus on the
   subject of his regression therapy, a girl named Victoria and a life
   that feels strangely similar to his own. In this song, there are many
   parts included from other songs from the album. At the beginning of
   "Overture 1928" (00:05-00:11) and at the guitar solo (01:35-01:51)
   there are riffs from [109]Metropolis Pt. 1. The "Strange Dj Vu" chorus
   appears from 00:44 to 01:01 and from 02:08 to 02:25. The main theme
   from "One Last Time" is used from 02:26 to 02:42. A part from "The
   Dance Of Eternity" is sampled from 02:45 to 03:08. This song is also a
   slight nod towards The Who's Tommy. The idea of an instrumental song
   describing an experience was the concept of the song "Underture" on
   that album.

[[110]edit] Scene Two: II. Strange Dj Vu

   We hear a little more about previous [111]dreams that have led Nicholas
   to his therapy, and also continue deeper in the current trance. We
   learn that every time he closes his eyes, he is taken to this very
   vivid, recurring dream of another (yet just out of reach of conscious
   understanding) life. We understand that it is what he's been dreaming
   previously that has led him to his regression therapy.

   The dream is as follows: there is a [112]pathway to a house. Inside the
   house and upstairs is a room where a girl appears in a mirror. All of
   this seems very familiar to him, but it logically shouldn't. In this
   dream, probably because this is actually a hypnotic trance and not just
   a regular dream, some things seem clearer than ever before. He can see
   the face of a young girl and poses the question, "Young child, won't
   you tell me why I'm here?" He sees that she has something to share with
   him, that there is a reason she is leading him here, a story to be
   told, and this story is of something terrible that is "tearing at her
   soul".

   Victoria now expresses her first hint at why she is haunting Nicholas.
   She has been searching for a way to reveal the truth about her
   [113]murder. She also expresses great [114]lament, "tears my heart into
   two". This along with the next line, "I'm not the one the Sleeper
   thought he knew", is her guilt that Julian Baynes never knew about her
   relationship with his brother, Senator Edward Baynes, which we learn
   about much later. She feels guilty for what she did to Julian.

   Now Nicholas is out of his therapy and back in real life. Even though
   he is awake, the thoughts and events of this other life are beginning
   to permeate every second of his day, and this is the beginning of his
   obsession with resolving this whole thing. He desperately wants to know
   why this is happening and would cross over to this other world
   consciously if he knew how. Nothing in the current day matters to him,
   only learning more about his new obsession. It is here that he has his
   first inclination that he may have actually lived in the world of which
   he dreams. He knows that this dreamland holds the key to his peace, and
   he will not rest until he unlocks that door.

[[115]edit] Scene Three: I. Through My Words

   Nicholas realizes that he was Victoria in a past life. He now knows why
   he feels so drawn to her and her world as they share the same soul.

[[116]edit] Scene Three: II. Fatal Tragedy

   It starts with Nicholas 'alone at night.' He knows who Victoria is now,
   but not why she is so torn or how he is involved. Sometime later he
   goes to visit an older man, who the story makes a point to tell us is
   'alone.' Whose house this is, and who the old man is, are things that
   are never made clear. The importance of the older man is that he knows
   a little about a murder that happened a long time ago and shares what
   he knows with Nicholas. We learn that a girl was murdered when she was
   very young. Nicholas sits and listens to the older man's tale and finds
   that exactly what happened still remains a mystery.

   Nicholas is then realizing that until he unveils the truth about what
   happened to Victoria, he cannot live his current life. He is stuck in
   this obsession and cannot turn back. We learn then that Nicholas
   understands that without faith and hope, 'there can be no peace of
   mind,' therefore Nicholas encourages himself to be strong and have
   faith that he will find the truth, because without the truth he will
   never rest. This song ends with the Hypnotherapist speaking. The next
   session starts with taking Nicholas back to the point of Victoria's
   murder.

[[117]edit] Scene Four: Beyond This Life

   We learn the [118]newspaper account of what happened in 1928. The story
   is that an anonymous witness heard a horrifying sound and upon reaching
   the scene of the sound discovered a woman who'd been shot dead, and the
   shooter standing over her. The witness tried to help, but the man shot
   himself next. The newspaper account talks of a sad close to a broken
   love affair. This indicates that the victim and the murderer are
   identified as previous or maybe even current lovers.

   The paper goes on to explain that Victoria and Julian had recently
   broken up due to Julian's decadent lifestyle; it's later suggested that
   [119]gambling and/or [120]drug addiction might be of significance.
   Julian later drops a [121]liquor bottle in scene 9, so it's possible
   his habit was drinking. It's also indicated that Victoria would have
   taken him back if he'd straighten up his lifestyle. The article
   speculates that the murder may have been premeditated.

   Next we read an account of the physical evidence at the scene. There is
   evidence of a 'violent struggle' and a [122]switchblade is found. The
   switchblade causes some confusion, because the victim is a young girl
   and typically you wouldn't expect a young girl in 1928 to be carrying a
   switchblade, unless she was anticipating a need to defend herself. Also
   found, in the killer's pocket, is a written note. It clearly reads that
   Julian would rather take his own life than live without Victoria, but
   it mentions nothing of harming her.

   Lastly, there is the repetition at the end of "Beyond This Life." These
   lines are deepening Nicholas's belief that he and Victoria share the
   same soul. They also indicate that not only souls reincarnate, but they
   also carry the same personality traits with them, and deeds will follow
   each soul throughout eternity.

[[123]edit] Scene Five: Through Her Eyes

   Nicholas is awake again. He has learned that Victoria was brutally
   murdered in 1928. He feels compelled to visit Victoria's grave. He
   expresses the sorrow he feels for her, and how helpless and innocent
   she was. Not only that, but since he's learning about his life by
   looking through her eyes, he realizes that this happened to HIM also
   and the unfairness of it begins to nag him.

   Upon reaching her grave, he is overcome with sadness. Even the words on
   her stone indicate that she was a sweet innocent girl who had her life
   brutally taken from her at a very young age. He is startled by how much
   her death feels like his own. He compares it to losing someone you
   love. He continues to let images of her wander through his mind as he
   just wallows in his sadness for a while. He thinks of how much more
   he's lived and again is stricken by the injustice of her young death.
   As the song ends, Nicholas begins to regain his composure and is
   comforted by the realization that by facing this tragedy and mourning
   the loss, he can now move on. This time of pain was necessary to accept
   his death in a previous life and fully comprehend why this other life
   has beckoned him.

[[124]edit] Act 2

[[125]edit] Scene Six: Home

   We hear Julian talk of his obsession with decadence and how he is only
   living a charade. Victoria (as we learned earlier) ultimately leaves
   him because of his addiction, considered by some to be a combination of
   cocaine and alcohol (possibly hinted at by the lyrics "Lines take me
   higher") and gambling. Next we hear Edward, giving his account of
   Victoria crying on his shoulder over her break up with Julian. He finds
   himself falling for her, and at first even feels guilt over deceiving
   his own brother. But his obsession for her becomes stronger than his
   guilt and he seduces her in her vulnerable state. He soon becomes
   violently possessive as well.

   Lastly we hear from Nicholas again, back in present day, and awake. So
   far he only knows what the older man told him, and what he learned
   about the newspaper article in his last therapy session. He knows there
   must be more to the story and he is obsessed with solving this mystery.
   He yearns for regression and cannot wait for his next therapy session
   so that he can get back to solving the mystery.

   There are several lyrical similarities between "Home" and "Metropolis
   Pt. 1," such as references to "the city's cold blood" and a "lake of
   fire," the lines "I was told there's a new love that's born for each
   one that has died." Also, "Home" contains the lines, "Victoria watches
   and thoughtfully smiles/she's taken me to my home," while "Metropolis"
   features, "Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles/she's taken you
   to your home." Also, in the last several seconds of the song, the
   beginning of Metropolis Pt. 1 is sampled.

[[126]edit] Scene Seven: I. The Dance of Eternity

   As last line of "Metropolis Pt. 1" says, "Love is the Dance of
   Eternity". This represents when Victoria and Ed make love, the dance
   because of the movements and eternity as the endless memory of that
   moment. The song begins with a sample of Part 1 played backwards.

[[127]edit] Scene Seven: II. One Last Time

   This song begins with Nicholas going over it in his head. He is not
   convinced, from the evidence given so far, that the newspaper account
   is the truth. He also appears to have heard some rumors, most likely
   rumors of Victoria's affair with Ed. Did Victoria wound Ed's soul and
   bid him farewell? Then we see Victoria, in the past again, saying "One
   last time, we'll lay down today." This may be Nicholas hearing Victoria
   telling Ed goodbye, that this will be their last meeting.

   Nicholas visits Edward's house, where he and Victoria had their affair.
   The house seems to hold many clues and he feels that he is finally
   shown some confirmation of what he's been thinking. Though he is now
   awake, as he enters the bedroom, he experiences a sort of revelation,
   almost as though he's slipped right out of consciousness. The cold
   returns, as he felt in his recurring dreams before, and he's suddenly
   outside and hears a woman screaming and a man pleading forgiveness. It
   is possible that Nicholas at this point suspects Edward and Victoria
   were having an affair. That is the suspicion to which the home holds
   many clues. In his current state of dual consciousness, he is seeing
   Victoria's memories of the fatal meeting, but he doesn't get enough
   info yet and the scene fades to black.

[[128]edit] Scene Eight: The Spirit Carries On

   Nicholas is again, and for the last time, under hypnosis and
   reiterating his belief that his soul will transcend, and that he need
   not fear death. He believes now that Edward was involved in the murder.
   He plans to expose the truth behind a crime that happened over 70 years
   ago. Victoria pipes up, in the present this time, and tells Nicholas
   that he should move on now, she has revealed the truth to him, but he
   should never forget her. At this point he basks in the peace that he
   feels as he has appeased Victoria's nagging and his own obsession.
   Nicholas now feels that the reason all of this happened, the ultimate
   message, is that death is not the end, but only a transition, as the
   Hypnotherapist has already pointed out.

[[129]edit] Scene Nine: Finally Free

   The last scene holds information Nicholas is not aware of, because the
   Hypnotherapist brings him out of his last hypnotic trance and we hear
   him get in his car and leave. What we learn is that Victoria and Julian
   meet by chance and decide to meet up later in secret so they can talk.
   She is obviously excited because Julian is the one she has always
   loved, and she's going to break it off with Edward. She is no longer
   torn between Edward and Julian, who she would rather have been with.
   But she knows Edward would "kill his brother if he only knew" of her
   affair with him.

   They meet without anyone knowing, or so they think. Edward shows up and
   begins struggling with Julian, who drops a bottle of [130]liquor out of
   his coat pocket and pulls out the knife. Ed shoots Julian. Victoria
   screams. Edward tells her "Open your eyes, Victoria," and shoots her
   also. Julian crawls over to her, collapses on top of her and utters his
   last lines ("One last time..."). Edward writes the suicide note, leaves
   it in Julian's pocket and then runs for help to play his part as the
   [131]witness.

   We then are transferred back to Nicholas. He's driving home and
   thinking about how he is free of the [132]haunting that has plagued
   him. Also he has learned about his life, that it will carry on after
   death, through Victoria's presence in his life. Nicholas arrives home,
   begins playing a record and pours himself a drink to relax. Soon
   another car pulls up. The Hypnotherapist enters the room and startles
   him by saying "open your eyes, Nicholas." The [133]phonograph gets
   bumped as Nicholas is startled by the Hypnotherapist. Then we hear
   static noise, which fades to black. The album recording leaves things
   unclear as to what happens, but it's revealed on the live DVD that the
   Hypnotherapist, Edward's reincarnation, has killed Nicholas and has
   completed the cycle yet again.

   The static from the phonograph marks the beginning of what fans have
   called a meta-album where the last note or noise of one album is the
   same or similar to the beginning of the next. The [134]Dream Theater
   meta-album spans 4 albums, from Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory
   to [135]Octavarium. [136]Octavarium Ends the meta-album by having the
   same piano note at the beginning and end of the same album, with the
   last lyrics stating "This story ends where it began."
