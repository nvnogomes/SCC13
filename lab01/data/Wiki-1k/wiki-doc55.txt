   Mendes (), the [30]Greek name of the [31]Ancient Egyptian city of
   Djedet, also known in [32]Ancient Egypt as [33]Per-Banebdjedet ("The
   Domain of the Ram Lord of Djedet") and Anpet, is known today as Tell
   El-Ruba ([34]Arabic: ).

   The [35]city is located in the eastern [36]Nile delta ([37]305730N
   313057E / 30.95833N 31.51583E / 30.95833; 31.51583) and was the
   [38]capital of the 16th [39]Lower Egyptian [40]nome of [41]Kha, until
   it was replaced by [42]Thmuis in Greco-[43]Roman [44]Egypt. The two
   cities are only several hundred meters apart. During the [45]29th
   dynasty, Mendes was also the capital of Ancient Egypt, which lies on
   the Mendesian branch of the [46]Nile (now silted up), about 35 km east
   of [47]al-Mansurah.

[[54]edit] History

   Mendes was a famous city in ancient times, attracting notice of most
   ancient geographers and historians, including [55]Herodotus (ii. 42,
   46. 166), [56]Diodorus (i. 84), [57]Strabo (xvii. p. 802), [58]Mela (i.
   9 9), [59]Pliny the Elder (v. 10. s. 12), [60]Ptolemy (iv. 5. 51), and
   [61]Stephanus of Byzantium (s. v.). The city was the capital of the
   [62]Mendesian nome, situated at the point where the Mendesian arm of
   the Nile ( , [63]Scylax, p. 43; Ptol. iv, 5. 10; Mendesium ostium,
   Pliny, Mela, ll. cc.) flows into the lake of [64]Tanis. Archaeological
   evidence attests to the existence of the [65]town at least as far back
   as the [66]Naqada II period. Under the first [67]Pharaohs, Mendes
   quickly became a strong seat of [68]provincial government and remained
   so throughout the Ancient Egyptian period. In [69]Classical times, the
   nome it governed was one of the nomes assigned to that division of the
   native army which was called the [70]Calasires, and the city was
   celebrated for the manufacture of a [71]perfume designated as the
   Mendesium [72]unguentum. (Plin. xiii. 1. s. 2.) Mendes, however,
   declined early, and disappears in the first century AD; since both
   Ptolemy (l. c.) and [73]P. Aelius Aristides (iii. p. 160) mention
   [74]Thmuis as the only town of note in the Mendesian nome. From its
   position at the junction of the river and the lake, it was probably
   [75]encroached upon by their waters, after the [76]canals fell into
   neglect under the [77]Macedonian kings, and when they were repaired by
   [78]Augustus ([79]Sueton. Aug. 18, 63) Thmuis had attracted its
   [80]trade and population.

[[81]edit] Religion

   The chief [82]deities of Mendes were the [83]ram deity Banebdjedet
   (lit. Ba of the Lord of Djedet), who was the [84]Ba of [85]Osiris, and
   his [86]consort, the fish goddess [87]Hatmehit. With their child
   [88]Har-pa-khered ("[89]Horus the Child"), they formed the triad of
   Mendes.

   The [90]ram deity of Mendes was described by [91]Herodotus in his
   History (Book II, 42)[Robin Waterfield translation] as being
   represented with the head and [92]fleece of a [93]goat: ...whereas
   anyone with a sanctuary of Mendes or who comes from the province of
   Mendes, will have nothing to do with ([94]sacrificing) goats, but uses
   [95]sheep as his sacrificial animals... They say that Heracles
   overriding desire was to see [96]Zeus, but Zeus was refusing to let him
   do so. Eventually, as a result of Heracles pleading, Zeus came up with
   a plan. He skinned a ram and cut off his head, then he held the head in
   front of himself, wore the fleece, and showed himself to Heracles like
   that. That is why the Egyptian statues of Zeus have a rams head, is why
   rams are sacred to the Thebans, and they do not use them as sacrificial
   animals. However there is just one day of the year--the day of the
   [97]festival of Zeus--when they chop up a single ram, skin it, dress
   the statue of Zeus in the way mentioned, and then bring the statue of
   Heracles up close to the statue of Zeus. Then everyone around the
   [98]sanctuary mourns the death of the ram and finally they bury it in a
   sacred tomb.

   Presumably following Herodotus' description, the occultist [99]Eliphas
   Levi in his Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie (1855) called his
   goat-headed conception of [100]Baphomet the "Baphomet of Mendes", thus
   popularizing and perpetuating this incorrect attribution, which has
   given rise to a flood of spurious connections, such as "The Goat of
   Mendes" by the [101]blackened death metal band [102]Akercocke.

[[103]edit] Ruins

   The site is today the largest surviving [104]tell in the Nile delta,
   and consists of both Tell El-Ruba (the site of the main temple
   enclosure) and [105]Tell El-Timai (the settlement site of Thmuis to the
   south). Overall, Mendes is about 3km long from north to south and
   averages about 900m east-to-west. An [106]Old Kingdom [107]necropolis
   is estimated to contain over 9,000 [108]interments. Several campaigns
   of 20th-century excavations have been led by [109]North American
   institutions, including [110]New York University and the
   [111]University of Toronto, as well as a [112]Pennsylvania State
   University team led by [113]Donald Redford. Under the direction of
   Prof. Redford, the current excavations are concentrating on a number of
   areas in and around the main [114]temple. Work on the [115]New Kingdom
   processional-style temple has recently uncovered foundation deposits of
   [116]Merenptah below the second [117]pylon. It is thought that four
   separate pylons or gates existed for each of the [118]avatars of the
   main deity worshiped here. Evidence has suggested that their
   construction dates from at least the [119]Middle Kingdom, as
   [120]foundation deposits were uncovered. The original structures were
   buried, added to, or incorporated into later ones over time by later
   rulers. [121]Billy Morin, recently at [122]University of Cambridge in
   [123]England and now at Leiden University in the Netherlands led a team
   that investigated these further and uncovered several mud-brick walls
   acting as pylons and their foundations . Over thirty of the bricks were
   stamped with the [124]cartouche of [125]Menkheperre, the pre-nomen of
   [126]Thutmose III. A [127]cemetery of sacred rams was discovered in the
   northwest corner of Tell El-Ruba. [128]Monuments bearing the names of
   [129]Ramesses II, [130]Merneptah. and [131]Ramesses III were also
   found. A temple attested by its foundation deposits was built by
   [132]Amasis. The tomb of [133]Nepherites I, which Donald Reford
   concluded was destroyed by the [134]Persians^[135][1], was discovered
   by a joint team from the [136]University of Washington and the
   [137]University of Toronto in 1992-1993. On the edge of the [138]temple
   mound, a [139]sondage supervised by [140]Matthew J. Adams has revealed
   uninterrupted [141]stratification from the late [142]Old
   Kingdom/[143]First Intermediate Period down to the [144]First Dynasty.
   Coring results suggest that future excavations in that sondage should
   expect to take the stratification down into the early [145]Naqada
   Period. The material excavated so far is already the longest
   uninterrupted stratification for all of the Nile Delta, and possibly
   for all of Egypt. An architectural and ceramic report on this
   unprecedented sequence is currently in progress.
