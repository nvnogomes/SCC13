   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edme Henry ([8]November 15, [9]1760 [10]September 14, [11]1841) was a
   [12]notary and political figure in [13]Lower Canada. He was also known
   as Edmund Henry.

   He was born in [14]Longueuil in 1760, the son of a surgeon-major in the
   Rgiment Royal Roussillon who settled on [15]Saint-Pierre and Miquelon
   leaving his wife and family in [16]Quebec. Henry attended the
   [17]Collge Saint-Raphal, studied law with [18]Simon Sanguinet, received
   his commission as a notary in 1783 and set up practice in [19]Montreal.
   In 1794, he moved to [20]La Prairie. He was elected to the
   [21]Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for [22]Huntingdon County in
   1810. Henry served as a major in the militia during the [23]War of
   1812, taking part in the [24]Battle of Chteauguay, and was promoted to
   lieutenant-colonel in 1822. Henry acted as [25]seigneurial agent for
   Napier Christie Burton, the son of [26]Gabriel Christie; he was also
   crown land agent for the seigneury of Prairie-de-la-Madeleine and
   served as commissioner for roads and bridges. In 1815, he established
   the villages of Christieville (later [27]Iberville), [28]Napierville,
   and [29]Henryville. Henry was also part owner of the [30]steamboat
   Edmund Henry. In 1828, he married Marie-Clotilde Girardin, the widow of
   [31]Jean-Baptiste Raymond, after the death of his first wife Eunice
   Parker. In 1837, he founded Henry's Bank, with branches at La Prairie
   and Montreal; he was temporarily forced into bankruptcy after his bank
   manager absconded with the cash.

   He died at La Prairie in 1841.
