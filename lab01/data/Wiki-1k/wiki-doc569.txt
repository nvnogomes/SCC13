   Die Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman without a Shadow) is an [27]opera in
   three acts by [28]Richard Strauss with a [29]libretto by his long-time
   collaborator, the poet [30]Hugo von Hofmannsthal. When the work
   premiered in [31]Vienna on [32]10 October [33]1919, critics and
   audiences were unenthusiastic (many cited problems with Hofmannsthal's
   complicated and heavily symbolic libretto). Today, the opera is
   considered by many to be Strauss's finest work in the
   genre,^[[34]citation needed] although less frequently produced than
   some of the others.

[[43]edit] Background of the Opera

   Work on the opera began in 1911. Hofmannsthals earliest sketches for
   the libretto are based on a piece by [44]Goethe, The Conversation of
   German Emigrants (1795). Hofmannsthal handles Goethes material freely,
   adding the idea of two couples, the emperor and empress who come from
   another realm, and the dyer and his wife who belong to the ordinary
   world. Hofmannsthal also drew on portions of the [45]Arabian Nights,
   [46]Grimm's Fairy Tales, and even quotes [47]Goethe's Faust. The opera
   is conceived as a fairy-tale on the theme of love blessed through the
   birth of children. Hofmannsthal, in his letters, compared it with
   [48]Mozarts [49]Magic Flute, which has a similar arrangement of two
   couples.

   Strauss began composing immediately. He and Hofmannsthal worked on
   music and words in parallel, each receiving inspiration from the other.
   Strauss was happy with Hofmannsthals text, but asked him to rewrite
   many passages for the sake of dramatic effect. Hofmannsthal was adamant
   to do it and was more worried with the [50]symbolism beneath his
   [51]libretto. The opera was finished in 1915, during the First World
   War, but had to wait for its premiere until 1919. The sometimes
   difficult genesis of the opera is documented in their correspondence.

   Strauss himself called this opera his child of woe (he even called it
   "Die Frosch", which in German means frog, that is "Die Frau ohne
   Schatten"). The complexity of the text and the stress of wartime made
   its composition a laborious task, and Strauss was also disappointed
   with the first productions.

   Musically, Die Frau ohne Schatten is one of Strausss most complicated
   and colorful scores. In contrast to the quickly-moving [52]Salome and
   [53]Elektra, it includes extended monologues and scenes. The opera
   remains a challenge to stage, even for a major opera house, calling as
   it does for five top soloists in the demanding principal roles,
   [54]first rate [55]secondary roles, a large orchestra, and elaborate
   sets and scenic effects.

   Scenically, it is also demanding, with all the scene changes and
   special effects. Children singing out of a frying pan is particularly
   demanding, as is the final golden waterfall scene. Few opera houses are
   capable of staging the work.

   In 1946 Strauss created a one-movement orchestral piece, the Fantasy on
   Die Frau ohne Schatten, based on high points from the opera. It was
   premiered in Vienna in 1947.

   three baritones
   Voices of Three Town Watchmen (Stimmen Der Wchter Der Stadt) baritones
   Servants of the Empress, other children and beggar-children,
   spirit-servants and spirit-voices

   The role of the Empress calls for a dramatic soprano who is also
   capable of extended coloratura passages containing trills, runs, and a
   high D (and that's just her first solo in Act One). Similarly, any
   tenor attempting the Emperor must be able to handle numerous passages
   in his uppermost range, particularly his extended solo scene in Act
   Two. The Nurse role sits mostly in the contralto range, but makes
   frequent leaps above the staff. The Dyer's Wife also calls for a
   soprano with immense sound to be heard over heavily orchestrated
   passages. The Dyer is the most approachable of the leading vocal parts,
   but again the orchestration is very heavy and requires a baritone with
   sufficient stamina to last the opera's three hours and fifteen minutes.

[[71]edit] Synopsis

   The opera's story is set in the mythical empire of the Southeastern
   Islands and involves five principal characters: the Emperor
   ([72]tenor), the Empress ([73]soprano), her Nurse ([74]mezzo-soprano or
   [75]contralto), Barak, a lowly dyer ([76]bass-baritone), and the Dyer's
   Wife, ([77]dramatic soprano). A sixth character, Keikobad, King of the
   Spirit Realm and father to the Empress, sets the plot in motion, but
   never appears on stage. The Empress is not human: she was captured by
   the Emperor in the form of a gazelle. She assumed human shape and he
   married her, but she has no shadow. This symbolizes her inability to
   bear children. Keikobad has decreed that unless the Empress gains a
   shadow before the end of the twelfth moon, she will be reclaimed by her
   father and the Emperor will turn to stone.

[[78]edit] Act 1

   Scene 1

   It is dawn, outside the bedchambers of the Emperor and Empress. The
   Messenger of Keikobad arrives, and tells the Empress' Nurse that the
   Empress must acquire a shadow within three days, or will be forcibly
   returned to his realm, and the Emperor turned to stone. The Nurse is
   excited about the prospect of returning to the spirit world, since she
   hates humans and having to dwell with them. The Messenger leaves and
   the Emperor emerges from his bedchamber. He departs on a three-day
   hunting trip, seeking his favorite falcon, which he drove away for
   attacking a gazelle that later turned into the Empress. He leaves his
   wife to the Nurse's care. The Empress emerges from her chamber and
   reminisces about times when she had the ability to turn into any
   creature she wanted, it is revealed that after being attacked by the
   red falcon that the Emperor is seeking, she lost a [79]talisman that
   gave [80]transformation powers, it had inscribed a curse that foresaw
   the fate she and the Emperor are about to face if she does not acquire
   a shadow. The red falcon appears and warns the Empress about it and
   begs the Nurse to help her get a shadow. The Nurse, who is steeped in
   magic, suggests descending to the mortal world and finding a woman who
   will sell her shadow to the Empress.

   Scene 2

   Barak, an old [81]dyer, shares his hut with his Wife and his three
   brothers: the One-Eyed Man, the One-Armed Man, and the Hunchback. The
   three brothers fight about a stolen item and are separated by the Wife,
   who throws at them a bucket of water. The brothers-in-law then argue
   with the Wife. Barak enters and peaces things, the Wife wants to have
   her [82]in-laws thrown out, but her husband refuses. The Dyer desires
   children, but his Wife fears the responsibility and has secretly sworn
   not to have any. The Dyer and his brothers leave, and the Empress and
   the Nurse arrive in disguise. The Wife wants them out of her house but
   the Nurse conjures up visions of luxury and promises them to the Wife
   in return for her shadow. The Wife agrees to deny her husband for three
   days during which the Nurse and the Empress will live at the Dyer's hut
   as poor relatives who have come to work as [83]servants. Barak
   approaches and the Wife is worried that dinner is not ready, the Nurse
   once more uses her magic to have everything ready, including the
   separation of Barak's bed. The Nurse and Empress disappear, while the
   Wife hears the offstage Voices of Unborn Children lamenting, which
   emerge from the fish that are cooking on the fire. The Dyer returns, to
   find he is barred from his marital bed; he initially considers this as
   a good [84]omen, for he knows that women act strangely "during the
   first days", assuming that her Wife might be pregnant, he hears the
   Town Watchmen sing of conjugal love and agrees to sleep on the floor.

[[85]edit] Act 2

   Scene 1

   The Empress, acting as a servant, helps the Dyer leave for work, but is
   troubled by her role, because Barak is very kind to her. The Nurse
   conjures up the image of a handsome youth by bringing a broom into
   life, which tempts the Dyer's Wife. The Dyer returns with his hungry
   brothers and beggar children. He has had a magnificent day at the
   market and has sold all his goods, having invited everyone to
   celebrate, however the Wife manages to ruin his celebration.

   Scene 2

   The Emperor, led by the red falcon, sees the Empress and Nurse
   surreptitiously enter his hunting lodge, and is suspicious. When he
   comes closer, he smells that the Empress has human odour. He resolves
   that he must kill her but cannot bring himself to do it, because the
   red falcon does not let him do it unless it is with his bare hands.

   Scene 3

   At the Dyer's house, the Dyer is drugged into sleep by the Nurse. The
   Nurse again conjures up the young man for the Wife, who grows
   frightened and rouses the Dyer. Barak is surprised to learn that there
   is a man in his house but is quickly shouted at by his Wife, who then
   leaves into the city, leaving her confused husband alone with the
   Empress who feels more guilty than before.

   Scene 4

   The Empress goes to sleep at the hunting lodge, but in her sleep she is
   further troubled by her crime and by the possible fate of the Emperor.
   She sees the Emperor walk into a big hall that she recognizes as her
   father's realm. Unseen choruses chant the curse in the talisman.

   Scene 5

   The next day, the Wife gives up her shadow. When light reveals that she
   has no shadow, the Dyer moves to strike her with a sword that appears
   in his hand. He is stopped by his brothers as the Wife begs for mercy.
   The Empress refuses to take over the shadow as it is covered in blood.
   Everyone is swallowed into the earth. A river floods into the house,
   and the Empress and Nurse depart on a magic boat, waiting judgement
   from Keikobad.

[[86]edit] Act 3

   Scene 1

   In a grotto beneath the realm of Keikobad, the Wife is haunted by the
   Voices of Unborn Children. She protests that she loves the Dyer, who
   regrets his attempted violence. A voice directs them up separate
   staircases.

   Scene 2

   The Empress and Nurse arrive before Keikobad's [87]Temple. The Nurse
   tries to convince the Empress to escape but she remembers the doors
   from her dream and knows that her father is waiting for her in the
   other side. She dismisses the Nurse and enters. The Nurse foretells the
   terrible tortures awaiting the Empress and misleads the Wife and Barak,
   who are looking for each other, she to die at her husband's hand, he to
   forgive her and hold her in his arms. Keikobad's Messenger condemns the
   Nurse to wander the mortal world.

   Scene 3

   Inside the Temple, the Empress speaks to Keikobad asking for
   forgiveness and to find her place amongst those who cast shadows.
   Keikobad does not answer but shows the Emperor already almost
   petrified. A voice urges her to drink from the [88]Fountain of Life,
   which is there, and claim the Wife's shadow to herself. But the Dyer
   and the Wife are heard offstage, and the Empress refuses to take their
   future happiness from them, for she cannot become human by robbing
   humanity from someone else, singing "I will - not!" This act of
   renunciation frees her: she receives a shadow, and the Emperor is
   restored. The scene changes to a beautiful landscape, Barak and his
   Wife are reunited and she receives her shadow again. Both couples sing
   of their humanity and praise their Unborn Children.
