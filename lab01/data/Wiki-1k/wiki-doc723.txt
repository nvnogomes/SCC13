[[26]edit] Early life

   Born in [27]Jacksonville, Florida, White was the 13th child of a former
   slave. She was adopted by Clara English White at a very young age and
   the two had an extremely loving relationship. It was from her mother's
   example that White sought to improve the condition of the poor and
   helpless people in Jacksonville.

   In her youth, White attended schools in Florida and New York. In 1893,
   upon graduation from the [28]Stanton School in Jacksonville, she moved
   to New York City for a brief period in order to avoid a [29]yellow
   fever quarantine. After high school she attended the Madam Hall Beauty
   School and the [30]National Conservatory of Music. She also became an
   opera singer with the Oriental American Opera Company (the first
   African-American opera company), where she sang as a lyric [31]soprano
   and traveled with the company throughout the United States and Europe.
   She returned to Florida in 1896, where she graduated from the Florida
   Baptist Academy.

[[32]edit] Adult life

   After graduation, White embarked on a sixteen-year teaching career in
   [33]Bayard and later at her alma mater, the Stanton School. She also
   became involved in political activities by participating in the
   [34]Republican Party as well as beginning the Colored Citizens
   Protective League in Jacksonville. In 1941, she joined with [35]A.
   Philip Randolph to protest job discrimination. She never married, lived
   frugally, and spent all her money on a wide range of philanthropic
   activities, including social work with prison inmates, an orphanage, a
   mother and baby home, a working women's childcare facility, homes for
   the aged, a boys' club and a mission for the poor, all of which, due to
   segregation, were directed primarily towards African-Americans.

   It was through the Clara White Mission that Eartha White made her
   biggest impact on the Jacksonville community. Her mother began the
   charity in the 1880s primarily as a soup kitchen to feed the needy. In
   1932, Ms. White purchased the old Globe Theater and named it the Clara
   White Mission in honor of her late mother, expanding the organization
   and moving it to its present location on Ashley Street in the
   [36]LaVilla neighborhood. Notably, the Mission was the only non-profit
   organization serving daily meals to the needy in the city.^[37][1]

   In 1970 she was awarded the Lane Bryant Award for Volunteer Service and
   was appointed to the President's National Center for Voluntary Action
   in 1971.

   Eartha White died of [38]heart failure at age ninety-seven on January
   18, 1974.

[[39]edit] Quotes

     * "I never married. I was too busy - What man would put up with me
       running around the way I do?"

   -According to Charles E. Bennett, author of Twelve On The River St.
   Johns
     * "I've already decided I want it to serve humanity. What would I do
       with it? Sit around the Plaza Hotel? I'm too busy."

   -After a reception at the White House with President Nixon, she quite
   characteristically responded to the question of how she would spend her
   cash reward

[[40]edit] Collections

   Eartha White's private collection of photographs and correspondence was
   split, after her death, between the Clara White Mission and the
   [41]University of North Florida's Thomas G. Carpenter Library Special
   Collections. They are both allowed to be viewed by the public.^[42][2]
