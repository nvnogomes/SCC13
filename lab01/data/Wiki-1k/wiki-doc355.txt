[[37]edit] Early life

   Sam Pitroda was born in India in Titilagarh, [38]Orissa.His parents
   hailed from Gujarat and migrated to Orissa. They were deeply influenced
   by Gandhi and his philosophy. Sam Pitroda and his brother were sent to
   Gujarat to imbibe Gandhian philosophy. Sam completed his schooling from
   Vallabh Vidyanagar in Gujarat and completed his Masters in Physics and
   Electronics from [39]Maharaja Sayajirao University in Vadodara. After
   completing a Masters in Physics from [40]Maharaja Sayajirao University
   in [41]Vadodara he went to the US and did his Masters in [42]electrical
   engineering from [43]Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.

   Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s he was involved in the
   cutting edge technology research work in telecommunications and
   handheld computing. He is particularly known for having introduced
   microprocessors in telephone switches leading to early digital
   switching. His invention of the Electronic Diary in 1975 is now
   regarded as one of the earliest examples of hand-held computing. With
   over 100 patents to his credit Pitroda has been a leading name in
   telecommunications and information technology for over three decades.

   He went on to found [44]Wescom Switching. Wescom was acquired by
   [45]Rockwell International, where Mr. Pitroda became a Vice President.

   In 1983, he also designed his own computer-themed card game called
   [46]Compucards which used binary numbers (1, 2, 4, 8...) instead of
   decimal and had a computer bug as the joker. The equivalent of a king
   in a regular deck of cards was the 'Programmer' that bore an uncanny
   resemblance to Mr. Pitroda himself.

   During his four decades as an engineer Mr. Pitroda has been involved
   filing scores of patents in telecommunications. The latest set of
   patents relate to mobile phone based transaction technology
   [([47]http://www.c-sam.com)] [([48]http://www.sampitroda.com])] which
   cover the entire spectrum of transactions, both financial and
   non-financial, via mobile phones.

[[49]edit] Government service

   In 1984, Mr. Pitroda was invited to return to India by the then
   [50]Prime Minister [51]Indira Gandhi. On his return, he started the
   Center for Development of Telematics ([52]C-DOT), an autonomous telecom
   R&D organization. In 1987, he became advisor to Mrs. Gandhi's
   successor, [53]Rajiv Gandhi and was responsible for shaping India's
   foreign and domestic telecommunications policies. He is largely
   considered responsible for the telecommunications revolution in India
   and specifically, the ubiquitous, yellow-signed Public Call Offices
   (PCO) that quickly brought cheap and easy domestic and international
   public telephones all over the country.

   An unpleasant and public disagreement over the degree of autonomy he
   would be granted with [54]K.P. Unnikrishnan, the Minister for
   Telecommunication in the [55]V.P. Singh government that followed Rajiv
   Gandhi's, led to his exit from public service and return to Chicago.

   For the subsequent decade, Pitroda continued his business interests in
   computer manufacturing and software. When the 2004 elections were
   declared, [56]Rahul Gandhi asked for his help for a small committee
   that he was forming to advise him on policy issues.

   When the [57]United Progressive Alliance government came to power
   following the [58]2004 General Elections, the Prime Minister Dr.
   [59]Manmohan Singh invited him to head the [60]National Knowledge
   Commission.

   In January 2008, [61]Andhra University, [62]Visakhapatnam, [63]Andhra
   Pradesh honoured Sam Pitroda with a Doctorate of Science.

[[64]edit] Awards

   Mr Pitroda is the recipient of prestigious [65]Canada India Foundation
   ("CIF") Chanchlani Global Indian Award (2008). The award instituted by
   the [66]Canada India Foundation is presented annually to an outstanding
   Indian who has demonstrated global leadership, vision, and personal
   excellence, which has made all of us of Indian origin extremely proud
   of our heritage. Mr. Pitroda received this award in presence of the
   Prime Minister of Canada [67]Stephen Harper and former president of
   India Dr. [68]Abdul Kalam.

   He was also awarded the Dataquest IT Lifetime Achievement Award in
   2002.

   He has been awarded the [69]Padma Bhushan award in 2009 by the
   Government of India for his contribution to Science and Engineering.

[[70]edit] Other contributions

   In 1993, Sam Pitroda established^[71][1] [72]Foundation for
   Revitalisation of Local Health Tradition [73](FRLHT) near [74]Bangalore
   in [75]India. At present, he is a Governing Council Member. The aim of
   the foundation is to make full use of India's rich and diverse
   medicinal knowledge. ^[76][2]
