Drag-resistant aerospike

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Drag-reducing aerospike)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   Trident I first launch on [9]18 January [10]1977 at Cape Canaveral. The
   thin antenna-like structure mounted on the [11]nose cone is the
   aerospike, which is composed of 2 parts. 1) The Extensible Boom is the
   long, slender, slightly tapered cylindrical structure; the wider
   "underside" is mounted to the nose cone. The narrow, top end of the
   Boom (see full resolution image) is for mounting:2) "flat, circular,
   metallic" plates (brownish/yellow color, above). New formulas can be
   tested to see how good the protection from supersonic flight. The
   plates are mounted perpendicular to the Vertical Axis--much like an
   upturned [12]Martini glass, the container representing the nosecone,
   with the stem and base representing the Boom and plate, respectively.

   A drag-reducing aerospike is a device used to reduce the forebody
   pressure [13]drag of blunt bodies at [14]supersonic speeds. The
   aerospike creates a detached [15]shock ahead of the body. Between the
   shock and the forebody a zone of recirculating flow occurs which acts
   like a more streamlined forebody profile, reducing the drag.

   This concept was first introduced on the [16]Trident missile and is
   estimated to have increased the range by 550 km. The Trident aerospike
   consists of a flat circular plate mounted on an extensible boom which
   is deployed shortly after the missile breaks through the surface of the
   water after launch from the submarine. The use of the aerospike allowed
   a much blunter nose shape, providing increased internal volume for
   payload and propulsion without increasing the drag. This was required
   because the Trident I C-4 was fitted with a third propulsion stage to
   achieve the desired increase in range over the [17]Poseidon C-3 missile
   it replaced. To fit within the existing submarine launch tubes the
   third stage motor had to be mounted in the center of the post-boost
   vehicle with the reentry vehicles arranged around the motor.

   Further development of this concept has resulted in the [18]air-spike
   ^[19][1]. This is formed by concentrated energy, either from an
   electric arc torch or a pulsed laser, projected forwards from the body,
   which produces a region of low density hot air ahead of the body. This
   has the advantage over a structural aerospike that the air density is
   lower than that behind a shock wave providing increased drag reduction.

   In 1995 at the 33rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting it was reported that
   tests were performed at an aerospike-protected missile dome to Mach 6,
   obtaining quantitative surface pressure and temperature-rise data on
   the feasibility of using aerospikes on [20]hypersonic missiles.
