   Petz ([16]Dogz and [17]Catz) is a series of games dating back to 1995,
   in which the player can adopt, raise, care for and breed their own
   [18]virtual pets. Petz were the world's first [19]virtual pets, first
   released before [20]Tamagotchi. They were among the first 3D
   characters, rendered in a non-photorealistic cartoon style. Petz has
   sold over 3 million copies worldwide, and appeals to both children and
   adults.

   The player starts at the Adoption Center, where they may choose a dog
   or cat to adopt of a breed and gender of their choosing. Once they have
   found a pet they like the user can adopt and name the new puppy or
   kitten. After around three days (real time) the petz become adults.
   Adult petz can then breed and have kittens or puppies of their own in
   Petz 3, Petz 4, and Petz 5 (this was not available in the first two
   lines). Cross-breeding can create different types of petz, called
   'Mixed Breeds'.

   There are a number of toyz, food/water bowls and treats available. Petz
   can learn tricks with positive rewards such as tickling and treats, or
   trained not to do something using the punishment (water) spray bottle.
   Petz must be looked after properly; abused or neglected petz may run
   away.

   Players may share their petz with others who have the game. Each
   version allows the importing of petz from all earlier versions. There
   is also a camera feature, permitting snapshots of petz to be taken and
   saved as .bmp files.

   One can choose to adopt dogz, catz or both depending on the version
   installed, and play with a small selection of other animals including
   pigz and bunniez. Later versions of the games included a Petz Web Fun
   Pack, Petz Publisher and a Petz Player web browser plug-in, allowing
   players to publish their petz online in playable webpages.

   Users soon learned how to reverse-engineer the system, and began
   producing additional breedz, toys, playscenes, clothes, and developer
   tools for the games, as permitted by [21]PF Magic, [22]Mindscape, and
   [23]Ubisoft Entertainment.

[[32]edit] Creature Design

   Body: (Ball style design) The petz are modelled as a set of balls
   joined by lines with variable parameters. The concept for this was
   developed in an early [33]PF Magic title, the fighting game [34]Ballz
   for Sega Genesis.This model was scrapped in the 2006 games "Dogz" and
   "Catz" for the PC for a more "realistic" look.

   Colours: There are 10 default colours that occur naturally in the game.
   These are white, black, 2 shades of grey (known as blue and silver),
   cream, brown, red/ruddy/sorrel/russet, orange, tan and dusty. In
   addition to these coat colours is the pink found on some Poodle
   variations. Eye colours are not limited to these 10, although shades of
   brown, green and blue are most common, particularly in low generation
   petz.

   Textures: Textures cover the balls, imitating fur.

   Paintballz: Some Breedz have splotches of colour on their bodies called
   Paintballz. The spots on the Alley Cat and Dalmatian are examples of
   this.

[[35]edit] Breedz

   Each Petz breed has its own body shape, personality and colour
   variations.

   Petz 2 began with 5 Breedz per game, and new ones were introduced
   through downloads the PF Magic website. In addition to what became 10
   Breedz, avid Petz fans began using a hex editor to modify the 10 Breedz
   to form new ones. This hexing continued through Petz 3 as well.

   Petz 3 and 4 contain 10 Breedz per game, referred to as the Original PF
   Magic Breedz. For Catz these are the [36]Alley Cat, [37]Black & White
   Shorthair (B&W), [38]Calico, [39]Chinchilla Persian, [40]Maine Coon,
   [41]Orange Shorthair (Oshie), [42]Persian, [43]Russian Blue,
   [44]Siamese (Meezer) and [45]Tabby. For Dogz these are [46]Bulldog,
   [47]Chihuahua, [48]Dachshund, [49]Dalmatian, [50]Great Dane,
   [51]Labrador Retriever, [52]Mutt, [53]Poodle, [54]Scottish Terrier
   (Scottie) and [55]Sheepdog.

   Petz 5 saw the addition of 5 new Breedz per game, referred to as the
   UbiSoft Breedz. For Catz these are the [56]Desert Lynx, [57]Egyptian
   Mau, [58]Honey Bear, [59]Japanese Bobtail and [60]Scottish Fold. For
   Dogz these are the [61]German Shepherd, [62]Golden Retriever, [63]Jack
   Russell Terrier, [64]Papillon and [65]Pug.

[[66]edit] Hexies

   Hexed breedz and petz -- called "hexies" -- are petz that have been
   modified to appear or act a certain way -- colour, size, behaviour,
   sound, shape, fuzziness, texture, paintballz and much more can be
   changed in this way. This can be particularly useful when creating new
   breedz and unique petz. The term comes from "hexadecimal code", which
   is the coding that is modified to create a hexie.

[[67]edit] Breeding and Petz Genetics

   Petz in the game can become attracted to one another and breed to
   produce offspring, much like in real life. This feature was introduced
   in [68]Petz 3 and has also appeared in [69]Petz 4 and Petz 5. In Petz 3
   and Petz 4, a petz couple could only produce one kitten/puppy per
   breeding, but in [70]Petz 5 a mother can bear up to 4 offspring and
   have litters.

   The user can encourage petz to fall in love by squirting them with love
   potions and perfumes and giving them food with [71]aphrodisiac-like
   qualities, as well as using other means. When petz have mated, a heart
   will appear on the screen informing the user of the female's pregnancy
   (which generally lasts 3 - 5 days).

   Petz' genes carry through to their offspring but can mutate (very
   easily in Petz 5, less so in previous versions), resulting in different
   fur and eye colours to that of the parents. Crossing small and big petz
   can also result in odd-looking offspring, and it is possible to
   selectively breed overly large or small Petz. If you breed two first
   generation Petz of the same breed their offspring will sometimes look
   identical, but then when they become kittens or puppies they will be
   slightly different looking.

   There are 10 coat colours a pet's body colour can be. These are the
   default colours listed in the Creature Design section. The eye colours
   are not restricted to these colours.

   When two different breeds of Petz are bred together, the offspring will
   have the base personality of one parent (or ancestor). The base
   personality can be determined by the pet's voice, their personality and
   behaviour (eg. if the pet trembles when it walks, it has an Orange
   Shorthair personality) and how they pose if they are a cat (different
   breeds pose with different expressions, and some pose more readily than
   others).
   Mixed breedz often clearly show traits of their base breeds, but also
   have mutations (eg. the ruddy fur and black eyes/eyelids in this case).

   Dogz and Catz cannot breed together as they rely on different base
   files that determine their movement and behaviour.

   Players have reported that in very rare cases, it is possible for two
   females to breed due to an unintentional coding glitch.

[[72]edit] Petz Life Cycle

   The difference between a high-gen calico (left) and one from the
   adoption center (right) can be easily seen, despite being the same
   breed

   When petz have babies, the player is asked to name the offspring.
   During the first few days of a pet's life, it is blind, small and
   cannot walk as it would be in real life. They cry when they are touched
   or picked up (which can irritate the mother). The mother feeds her
   infant and the user can do so with the milk bottle.

   In Petz 5, the mother is confined to "The Nursery" at all times and the
   father is unable to visit his mate or offspring.

   The [73]newborn will later become an [74]infant, or toddler. Its eyes
   have opened and it is able to walk around, jump onto ledges and has
   stopped suckling. They can eat from food bowls and drink from the milk
   bottle, but cannot swallow treatz.

   Eventually, the offspring will separate from their mothers as they grow
   to kittenz and puppiez.

   As a result, many generations and colors may occur in the game, even in
   purebreds. The differences can be enormous. A maximum of 8 generations
   can be recorded in the pet's file and family tree, although Petz can
   obviously be bred to much higher generations.

[[75]edit] 2006 Petz

   The 2006 and onwards Petz games bear little resemblance to the original
   Petz games, and can (and should) be considered different series
   entirely. Instead of mathematically generated ball-and-line modelled
   Catz and Dogz that could grow, breed and interact with each other (as
   opposed to a separate game for each species), the 2006 Petz feature 3D
   graphics that can be retextured, but not remodelled by players due to
   the expensive software used to create them (the resulting model files
   being saved in a format incompatible with other 3D programs).

   Six other games were released along with Catz and Dogz. These were
   Bunnyz, Horsez, Tigerz, Dolphinz, Monkeyz and Hamsterz. The new Petz
   games were produced for a range of consoles, including Playstation 2,
   Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, Gameboy Advance and PC. On the DS and GBA,
   the player can care for up to three catz or dogz, which are unable to
   breed, whilst on the Wii and PS2, the player controls a cat/dog on an
   adventure quest to save the planet from Ivlet, an evil wolf. In this
   version the player may customize his/her cat or dog to their style,
   respectively. In the PC version, the player cares for a single pet.
