   Location of Druzno Lake

   Druno ([16]Polish: Jezioro Druzno; [17]German: Drausensee,
   [18]Lithuanian: Drsuo) is a body of water historically considered a
   [19]lake in northern [20]Poland on the east side of the [21]Vistula
   delta, near the city of [22]Elblg. As it is currently not deep enough
   to qualify as a lake hydrologically and receives some periodic inflow
   of sea water from the [23]Vistula Lagoon along the [24]Elblg River,
   some suggest that it be termed an estuary reservoir. A village of
   recent origin also called Druno is situated near the lake.

   The German name Draussensee, in earlier records called Drusensee, is
   connected to the ancient trade city of [25]Truso, which stood within
   the lands now occupied by Elblg. The lake is greatly reduced from its
   original size partly due to large building expansion of housing in the
   last few decades, but mainly because of the natural death of the lake
   by sedimentation. The lake is the site of a [26]nature reserve, one of
   the 13 sites in Poland protected under the [27]Ramsar convention.

[[39]edit] Geography

   The central coordinates of the lake are [40]544N 1927E / 54.067N 19.45E
   / 54.067; 19.45. It lies to the east of the [41]Nogat, the main right
   branch of the lower Vistula, at the edge of the lowland of the delta
   (uawy Wilane), which is a region of shifting sediments and channels
   partly controlled by dikes, dams and ditches, about 181 square
   kilometres (70 sq mi). in area and sometimes up to 1.8 metres (5.9 ft)
   below sea level. The delta ends at Elblg upland (Wysoczyzna Elblska),
   much of which is wooded. The delta itself is sparsely populated,
   despite the presence of large cities nearby (Gdansk, Elblag and
   others). Most of it is rich agricultural land and the rest is a
   wildlife habitat of great natural beauty.

   The lake today is a 13 to 29 square kilometres (5.0 to 11 [42]sq mi).
   body of water with a mean depth of about 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) and a
   maximum depth of 3 metres (9.8 ft). The lake is drained by the Elblg
   River. There is only a 0.1 metres (3.9 in) difference in altitude
   between the lake and Elblska Bay, which projects from Vistula Lagoon.
   The surface altitude of these bodies varies for a few reasons, such as
   wind. When there is a strong wind blowing to the south the bay can be a
   meter or so higher than the lake, which causes back currents in the
   river.

   The Prussians called Vistula Lagoon by the name "fresh-water bay",
   which it was in those days. Since then the greatly diminished egress of
   Vistula water, due to human uses, has brought Baltic water into the
   bay, now brackish. As a result back currents in the river bring
   intrusions of brackish water into the lake. Generally the southern end
   remains fresh. There probably always were reversals of river current,
   which must have speeded traffic between Frisches Haff and the lake.

   The lake is surrounded by and includes marsh, swamp and [43]alder
   thickets. On its surface are floating [44]Nymphaea, submerged are
   [45]Potamogeton and the marshes feature tracts of [46]Phragmites. It
   should have sedimented over long ago but the high throughput of water
   from various sources brings fresh Oxygen into the lake, retarding its
   aging.

   Twelve streams empty into the lake radially, with water from another
   twelve canals being pumped into it. They bring about 6.9 cubic metres
   per second (240 cu ft/s) into the lake (1970) with about 7 draining
   through the river (1975). Variability in these figures as well as wind
   and back currents cause expansion and contraction of the lake over wide
   areas. The total capacity is about 22.4 million cubic metres
   (18,200 [47]acreft) with a catchment area of 1,084 square kilometres
   (419 sq mi).

[[48]edit] Historical uses of the lake

   The lake is valuable currently mainly as a nature preserve. Some 20,000
   migratory waterfowl use it, chiefly [49]Anser, [50]Anas, [51]Grus and
   [52]Chlidonias.

   In ancient times the lake was deeper and of wider extent. In the
   troubled Viking Age and the conflicts and acts of piracy between the
   various tribes of the Balts and voyagers from Scandinavia and
   elsewhere, the lake would have been an ideal masked route for
   shallow-draft vessels, such as the Viking ships. When the lake became
   useless for that purpose Elblag was still a port with access to the
   [53]Zalew Wislany and through there to the [54]Gulf of Danzig. It rose
   to prominence as that. The remains of Truso may be one of the
   archaeological sites in the area, or it may be under Elblag, or may
   have been obliterated by construction.

   In an attempt to make the inland region more accessible, the Prussian
   government opened the [55]Elblg Canal through the lake in 1860. The
   northern terminus of the canal route to the south is [56]Elblg. It runs
   through a dredged channel in the lake and becomes an overland canal to
   the south; that is, the canal is composed of sections connected by
   tracks for lifting and lowering vessels. It joins a number of lakes to
   the south, but they are not drained by the canal. During its life the
   canal was used mainly to haul timber to the coast. After destruction in
   World War II the canal was restored in 1948 but finds little commercial
   use now. Instead the entire route has been converted into a
   recreational area featuring nature preserves such as Lake Druzno.

[[57]edit] Prehistory of the lake

[[58]edit] Janow Pomorski site

   Janow Pomorski is a village about 7 km to the southeast of [59]Elblg
   where the traces of some workshops have been found that were on the
   then edge of the lake. A large abundance of finished and partly
   finished artifacts in antler and amber have been found. They were
   manufactured in structures of about 5 by 10 metres (16 ft  33 ft), and
   long houses about 6 by 21 metres (20 ft  69 ft) above ground, three
   rooms, made of wood, believed to be residences also. A cache of wrecked
   boats has been found. The artifacts are similar to both Slavic and
   Scandinavian equivalents. Some archaeologists suggest that this may be
   the site of Truso; however, the name may have referred to a collection
   of settlements.

   The settlement is dated from the late 8th century to the early 10th by
   pottery. Trenches nearby have uncovered two layers of peat sandwiching
   a layer of peat and sand over a thick layer of silt. The layers have
   been dated by a variety of methods. The history of the lake is roughly
   reconstructed as follows:
     * Originally Eblska Bay extended into the region of the lake.
     * Extension of the Vistula Delta closed off the lake from the bay at
       about 2000 [60]BP.
     * A rise in sea level brought the lake and the bay together again.
     * A second advance of the delta created the current configuration by
       1000 BP except that the lake was larger and deeper. It has been
       filling in and growing over since then.

   The lake in this view is seen as a transitory phenomenon created by
   accidents of topography and the growth of the [61]Vistula Delta. The
   combined lake and bay might have served as a natural border in
   antiquity but whether it was one remains to be demonstrated. Truso must
   have been settled between the 2000 BP and 1000 BP lake maxima. Truso
   might well have been at [62]Janw Pomorski, but the artifacts give no
   indication that the native populations were Prussian, Slavic or
   Scandinavian.

   It is true that in 1237 the entire right bank of the lower [63]Vistula
   was occupied by [64]Old Prussians and that Truso was in or projected
   into the Old Prussian dukedom of [65]Pomesania. Moreover [66]Adalbert
   of Prague had been beheaded further north-east at the coast of the
   Baltic Sea near Rybaki (Fischhausen) for cutting down the sacred groves
   of the Old Prussians as part of an effort to convert them (997 [67]AD).
   This circumstantial evidence is not conclusive about the ethnicity of
   the founders of Truso.

   In 1237 also the [68]Teutonic Order opened hostilities against the Old
   Prussians, putting down a castle at the future [69]Elbing. The order's
   modus operandi was to sack and burn an Old Prussian town and then hold
   it against reoccupation with a stone keep nearby, around which a new
   town of Germanic or mixed ethnicity would grow. There is no evidence
   yet that they practiced that method on Truso, although the question is
   still open. According to the Museum at Elblg, Truso was burned down by
   pirates or robbers two centuries before. Its relationship to the order
   at Elbing remains unknown.

[[70]edit] Ptolemy and the prehistory

   [71]Ptolemy,^[72][1] writing in the period of the initial lake, refers
   to the entire Gulf of Gdask as Venedicus Bay and states that the
   Greater Venedae occupied its coast. The name is known also among the
   Slavic [73]Wends, but he may have meant by "Greater" that Balts were to
   be included; if not, one would have to ask where the historical Balts
   came from. There were some historical [74]Vends later in Latvia, who
   may have been their descendants.

   Ptolemy does mention the Prussians by name (Borusci), but also the
   Gythones appear at the mouth of the Vistula. These can be interpreted
   as [75]Goths or the early settlements of [76]Gdask might have been
   there under that name. There is no explicit mention of a town of Danzig
   and he does not give his usual list of river towns for the Vistula and
   eastward. Truso was at a location where already in the [77]Roman Empire
   and before the (only) people who collected and traded amber shipped it
   south on the [78]Amber Road to [79]Carnuntium and further. In [80]Old
   Prussian history it is known, that Northmen, Danes came to Prussia and
   intermarried. A number of swords along the [81]Nemunas river, attest to
   their presence.

[[82]edit] Wulfstan and the prehistory

   [83]Wulfstan of Hedeby left an account of a voyage dated to about 880
   AD as told to [84]Alfred the Great and inserted into his translation of
   [85]Orosius' Histories. It is the first mention of the lake in history
   and also briefly describes the Prussians of the times, which he calls
   "Aesti" .Aisti- Aesti (meaning easterners) was the name used for Baltic
   Prussian in records starting 800 years earlier.

   Wulfstan sailed from [86]Hedeby (Haithabu), [87]Jutland to Truso in
   seven days keeping Weonodland ("Wendland") on the right as far as the
   mouth of the Weissel (Vistula). These Venedi are on the opposite bank
   of the Vistula from the Greater Venedi of Ptolemy. By mouth of the
   Vistula Wulfstan explains that he means the passage between Frisches
   Haff and the Bay of Danzig.

   The Ilfing River runs east of the Weisel from a lake on the banks of
   which stands Truso into the Estmere (Eastern Sea-Ostsee), where it is
   incorporated into the Weissel; i.e., Wulfstan sees the Ilfing as a
   tributary of the Weissel and Estmere as the lower Weissel.

   Weonodland extends as far as the Weissel, after which Witland, the
   westernmost part of Eastland, begins. It is generally agreed that
   Wulfstan is interpreting the source of Tacitus' [88]Aestii as Eastland.
   The Estonians ultimately inherited the name, but in Wulfstan it has to
   mean at least the Prussians, perhaps further.

   This passage tells us that the topography was more or less modern. The
   lake is not named, but it is considered a lake drained by the Ilfing
   River. Being east of the Weissel, Truso, the lake and the river must be
   in Witland, but Wulfstan does not say that. He describes the Estonians
   (Balts) as being a rich and populous nation divided into towns, each of
   which was ruled by a king. The passage does not pinpoint Truso as being
   in Weonodland or Eastland and does not say if they are Estonians.

[[89]edit] Languages of the ethnic populations

   By [90]Ptolemy's time the [91]Proto-Balto-Slavic language had divided
   into [92]Proto-Baltic and [93]Proto-Slavic, perhaps even into dialects.
   As the greater Venedi and the Weonods cannot have spoken the same
   language the name must once have applied to both [94]Balts and
   [95]Slavs (unless Ptolemy was wrong).

   Each were on a different bank of the [96]Vistula, Ptolemy's border
   between Greater Germany and European Sarmatia. On the left bank Ptolemy
   lists only peoples he considers Germans. There is no sign of any
   Venedi, [97]Pomeranians or [98]Kashubians. The [99]Ruticli live in
   Pomerania with the [100]Lugii to the south of them. Some Gotini (Goths)
   and [101]Aelvaeones (Elbingers?, local name is to this day Albinger)
   dwell on the lower Vistula.

   On the right bank are the Gythones. It would not be surprising to find
   Goths there too, but if the Gythones are Danzigers, they must have
   extended to [102]Vistula Spit. East of them were the Venedae, south of
   whom were the Galindae (one of the Prussian tribes). The Venedae
   therefore must have been the coastal Estonians of Wulfstan,
   [103]Western Baltic ancestral speakers.

   By Wulfstan's time the [104]East Germanics had abandoned the left bank
   of the Vistula. Some may have remained in and around the Vistula Delta,
   especially Danzig, possibly Truso. The [105]Slavs had expanded north
   into Pomerania. Proto-Slavic began to differentiate after the Slavs
   expanded beyond their [106]Carpathian homeland in the 6th century AD,
   too late for the foundation of Truso.

   From the fact that the name of [107]Charlemagne (742-814 AD), which
   became the Slavic word for king, entered Proto-Slavic, and other
   indicators used by historical linguists,^[108][2] it has been deduced
   that [109]Old Church Slavonic is in fact Proto-Slavic. By 1000 AD it
   was showing traces of influence by regional dialects. By that time the
   Slavs had been on the Baltic coast for some time; i.e., Wulfstan's
   Weonods were speakers of Proto-Slavic. They were probably there before
   Charlemagne, but he encouraged them to settle along the Baltic.
   Adalbert's Danzig was not only Christian but very recently under Slavic
   control, if not to some degree Slavic speaking.

   After Adalbert events moved rapidly to produce great changes.
   [110]Pomerania as a governable territory appeared in the 10th century;
   by the 11th the initial state of [111]Poland had formed and was
   contending with the [112]Dukes of Pomerania for control. It was
   probably at this time that [113]Lekhitic developed and moved rapidly to
   [114]Polish, [115]Pomeranian, [116]Kashubian and [117]Slovincian.
   Eastern Pomerania was the Duchy of [118]Pomerelia, which spit into
   others including Kashubian-speaking areas west of Gdask. Kashubian is
   distinguished by a large number of [119]Low German loans.

   On the right bank of the Vistula the Proto-Baltic speakers had been
   gradually giving ground to the Proto-Slavs in the east and lost
   Pomerania to Germanic expansion. They divided into West and East Baltic
   in the middle of the 1st millennium. The Goths achieved domination over
   the West Balts for a time and then were gone. After 1000 Old Prussian
   Galindian and Sudovian existed. In East Baltic Lithuanian and Latvian
   were distinct. Between east and west was Curonian. This was the ethnic
   distribution when the [120]Teutonic Order received Prussia from the
   [121]Emperor Frederick II and from the pope. The papal bull also
   granted them the government of all the Balts, as well as the Finnic
   Estonians, with consequences that continue today.

   The Slavs had been moving in on the Old Prussians but had been stopped
   by them. The different duchies made hypocritical claims to lands they
   never controlled and invited the Teutonic Order to suppress
   "rebellions" there. It is possible therefore that the Kashubian Duchy
   of Gdask was asserting a nominal claim over Lake Druno and Truso, but
   it was never one recognized by the Old Prussians.

[[122]edit] The name

   The name of the settlement has been restored in Old Prussian by the
   linguist Letas Palmaitis as [123]*Drs.^[124][3] Such a restoration,
   however, must refer to a language more recent by a few hundred years
   than the attested Truso, which is the first known settlement name in
   the coastal region. The possible originating cultures are not
   diminished by this restoration, but without further evidence it is hard
   to say what the language of the settlement's initial population was.

   In one theory the name is [125]Slavic in origin: "(Z)Druno" means
   "together" in [126]Slavic languages. It might have been named from
   being a place of gathering and resting for the caravan traders of
   various nationalities. (This is a complete nonsensical uttering)

   On the other hand the historical linguist [127]Julius Pokorny lists
   [128]*trus-, "reed", as an [129]Indo-European root, not used in
   English, but appearing in [130]Old Church Slavonic and [131]Lithuanian
   words from a Balto-Slavic form *trusom.

   If the place was named from the reeds, which are still there, it
   probably acquired the name *Trusom during the growth of the second
   lake, evolving into the Old Prussian reconstruction from which came the
   Germanic Drusen, High German Drausen. Such a derivation still does not
   pinpoint the language spoken by the settlers.

   In 1897 and in the 1920's escavations near Gut Hansdorf brought a
   number of archaeological finds to light and it was assumed that it was
   Truso. These artifacts were kept at the Elbing Museum. War years and
   the take-over by communists stopped further research. Recently
   excavations near Gut Hansdorf (now Janowo) were resumed by Polish
   authorities and the site of 20 [132]hectares (49 [133]acres) unearthed.
