   The ATX (for Advanced Technology Extended) [32]form factor was created
   by [33]Intel in 1995. It was the first big change in [34]computer case
   and [35]motherboard design in many years. ATX overtook [36]AT
   completely as the default form factor for new systems. ATX addressed
   many of the AT form factor's annoyances that had frustrated system
   builders. Other standards for smaller boards (including [37]microATX,
   [38]FlexATX and [39]mini-ITX) usually keep the basic rear layout but
   reduce the size of the board and the number of expansion slot
   positions. In 2003, Intel announced the [40]BTX standard, intended as a
   replacement for ATX. As of 2009^[41][update] the ATX form factor
   remains the industry standard for do-it-yourselfers; [42]BTX has
   however made inroads into pre-made systems, being adopted by computer
   makers like [43]Dell, [44]Gateway, and [45]HP.

   The official specifications were released by Intel in 1995, and have
   been revised numerous times since, the most recent being version
   2.2,^[46][1] released in 2004.

   A full size ATX board is 305 mm wide by 244 mm deep (12" x 9.6" ). This
   allows many ATX form factor chassis to accept [47]microATX boards as
   well.

[[76]edit] Power supply

   ATX form motherboards became increasingly popular because of their
   advantages over older [77]AT motherboards.

[[78]edit] Main changes from AT design

[[79]edit] Power switch

   AT-style computer cases had a power button that was directly connected
   to the system [80]computer power supply (PSU). The general
   configuration was a double-pole latching mains voltage switch with the
   four pins connected to wires from a four-core cable. The wires were
   either [81]soldered to the power button (making it difficult to replace
   the power supply if it failed) or [82]blade receptacles were used.
   Typical ATX [83]power supply
   Interior view of an ATX power supply.

   An ATX power supply does not directly connect to the system power
   button, allowing the computer to be turned off via [84]software.
   However, many ATX power supplies have a manual switch on the back to
   ensure the computer is truly off and no power is being sent to the
   components. With this switch on, energy still flows to the components
   even when the computer appears to be "off." This is known as soft-off
   or standby and can be used for remote wake up through [85]Wake-on-Ring
   or [86]Wake-on-LAN, but is generally used to power on the computer
   through a front switch.

[[87]edit] Power connection to the motherboard

   The power supply's connection to the motherboard was changed. Older AT
   power supplies had two similar connectors that could be accidentally
   switched, usually causing short-circuits and irreversible damage to the
   motherboard. ATX used one large, keyed connector instead, making a
   reversed connection very difficult. The new connector also provided a
   3.3 volt source, removing the need for motherboards to derive this
   voltage from one of the other power rails. Some motherboards,
   particularly late model AT form factor offerings, supported both AT and
   ATX PSUs.

   If you are not working with an ATX motherboard you can only turn on the
   power by shorting the green wire from the ATX connector to a black wire
   on the connector (or ground), since it is the motherboard's power
   switch which the ATX PSU uses. This means that an old PC power supply
   can be used for tasks other than powering a PC, but one must be careful
   to observe the minimum load requirements of the PSU.

[[88]edit] Airflow

   ATX was originally designed with the power supply drawing air into the
   case and exhausting it down onto the motherboard. The plan was to
   deliver cool air directly to the CPU's and power regulation circuitry's
   location, which was usually at the top of the motherboard in ATX
   designs. This was not particularly useful for a variety of reasons.
   Early ATX systems simply didn't have processors or components with
   thermal output that required special cooling considerations. Later ATX
   systems with significantly greater heat output would not be aided in
   cooling by a power supply, because it would be delivering its often
   significantly heated exhaust into the case. As a result, the ATX
   specification was changed to make PSU airflow optional.[89][1]

[[90]edit] ATX power supply revisions

[[91]edit] Original ATX

   ATX, introduced in late 1995, defined three types of power connectors:
     * 4-pin peripheral connector (commonly but inaccurately known as
       "MOLEX")transferred directly from AT standard
     * 4-pin floppy connectortransferred directly from AT standard
     * 20-pin main motherboard connectornew to the ATX standard

   The power distribution specification defined that most of PSU's power
   should be provided on 5V and 3.3V rails, because most of the electronic
   components (CPU, RAM, chipset, PCI, AGP and ISA cards) used 5V or 3.3V
   for power supply. The 12V rail was only used by fans and motors of
   peripheral devices (HDD, FDD, CD-ROM, etc.).

   The original ATX power supply specification remained mostly unrevised
   until year 2000.

[[92]edit] ATX12V 1.x

   While designing the Pentium 4 platform in 1999/2000, the standard
   20-pin ATX power connector was deemed inadequate to supply increasing
   electrical load requirements. So, ATX was significantly revised into
   ATX12V 1.0 standard (that is why ATX12V 1.x is sometimes inaccurately
   called ATX-P4). ATX12V 1.x was also adopted by Athlon XP and Athlon 64
   systems.

[[93]edit] ATX12V 1.0

   The main changes and additions in ATX12V 1.0 (released in February
   2000) were:
     * An extra 4-pin, 12-volt connector to power the CPU. Formally called
       the "+12 V Power Connector", this is commonly referred to as the P4
       connector because this was first needed to support the [94]Pentium
       4 processor. (Older processors were powered from the 5V rail.)
     * A supplemental 6-pin AUX connector providing additional 3.3V and 5V
       supplies to the motherboard, if it needed it. Although it was
       provided by every ATX12V 1.x PSU (as required per standard), it was
       rarely required by motherboards.
     * Increased the power on the 12V rail (power on 5V and 3.3V rails
       remained mostly the same).

[[95]edit] ATX12V 1.1

   This is a minor revision from August 2000. The power on 3.3V rail was
   slightly increased, among other much lesser changes.

[[96]edit] ATX12V 1.2

   A relatively minor revision from January 2002. The only significant
   change was that the 5V rail was no longer required (it became
   optional). This voltage was very rarely used, only on some old systems
   with some ISA add-on cards.

[[97]edit] ATX12V 1.3

   Introduced in April 2003 (a month after 2.0). Lot of relatively minor
   changes. Some of them are:
     * Slightly increased the power on 12V rail.
     * Defined minimal required PSU efficiencies for light and normal
       load.
     * Defined acoustic levels.
     * Introduction of Serial ATA power connector (but defined as
       optional).

[[98]edit] ATX12V 2.x

   ATX12V 2.x brought a very significant design change regarding power
   distribution. When analyzing the then-current PC architectures' power
   demands, it was determined that it would be much easier (both from
   economical and engineering perspectives) to power most PC components
   from 12V rails, instead of from 3.3V and 5V rails.

[[99]edit] ATX12V 2.0

   The above conclusion was incorporated in ATX12V 2.0 (introduced in
   February 2003), which defined quite different power distribution from
   ATX12V 1.x:
     * The main ATX power connector was extended to 24 pins (it is
       backwards compatible). The extra four pins provide one additional
       3.3V, 5V and 12V circuit.
     * The 6-pin AUX connector from ATX12V 1.x was removed because the
       extra 3.3V and 5V circuits which it provided are now incorporated
       in the 24-pin main connector.
     * Most power is now provided on 12V rails. The standard specifies
       that two independent 12V rails (12V2 for the 4 pin connector and
       12V1 for everything else) with independent overcurrent protection
       are needed to meet the power requirements safely (some very high
       power PSUs have more than two rails, recommendations for such large
       PSUs are not given by the standard).
     * The power on 3.3V and 5.V rails was significantly reduced.
     * Serial ATA power cable is required.
     * Many other specification changes and additions.

[[100]edit] ATX12V v2.1

   This is a minor revision from March 2005. The 5V rail was completely
   removed from the specification. The power was slightly increased on all
   rails.

[[101]edit] ATX12V v2.2

   Another minor revision, the main change was a call for higher-quality
   connectors on the motherboard power connectors.

[[102]edit] ATX power supply derivatives

[[103]edit] AMD GES

   This is an ATX12V power supply derivative made by AMD to power its
   Athlon MP (dual processor) platform. It was used only on high-end
   Athlon MP motherboards. It has a special 8-pin supplemental connector
   for motherboard, so an AMD GES PSU is required for such motherboards
   (those motherboards will not work with ATX(12V) PSUs).

[[104]edit] EPS12V

   Defined in [105]SSI, and used by some (Xeon and [106]Opteron)
   systems^[[107]dubious [108]discuss]. It has 24 pin main connector, 8
   pin secondary connector, optional 4 pin tertiary connector.

[[109]edit] Recent specification changes and additions

   Because video card power demands have dramatically increased over the
   2000s, some high-end graphics cards have power demands that exceed
   [110]AGP or [111]PCIe slot capabilities. For these cards, supplementary
   power was delivered through a standard 4-pin peripheral or floppy power
   connector. Midrange and high-end PCI Express-based video cards
   manufactured after 2004 typically use a standard 6 or 8-pin PCIe power
   connector directly from the PSU.

[[112]edit] Interchanging old/new systems with old/new PSUs

   Although the ATX power supply specifications are all vertically
   compatible in both ways (both electrically and physically), it is not
   wise to mix old motherboards/systems with new PSU's, and vice versa.

   There are two main reasons for this:
     * The power distribution biases across 3.3V, 5V and 12V [113]rails
       are very different between older and newer ATX PSU designs, as well
       as between older and newer PC system designs.
     * Older PSUs may not have connectors which are required for newer PC
       systems to properly operate.

   This is a practical guidance what to mix and what not to mix:
     * Older systems (until Pentium 4 and Athlon XP platforms) were
       designed to draw most power from 5V and 3.3V rails.
     * Pentium 4 and Athlon XP systems draw much more from 12V rail,
       instead from 5V and 3.3V rails.
     * Newer systems (Athlon 64, Core Duo etc.) draw most power from 12V
       rails.
     * Original ATX PSUs have power distribution designed for pre-P4/XP
       PCs. They lack the supplemental 4-pin 12-volt connector for the
       CPU, so they simply cannot be used with P4/XP era or newer
       motherboards (adapters do exist but power drain on the 12V rail
       must be checked very carefully if using them).
     * ATX12V 1.x PSUs have power distribution designed for P4/XP PCs, but
       they are also greatly suitable for older PCs, since they give
       plenty of power (relative to old PCs' needs) both on 12V and on
       5V/3.3V. Some of them might not have the -5V rail which is needed
       for some special add-in ISA cards. It is not recommended to use
       ATX12V 1.x PSUs on ATX12V 2.x motherboards because those systems
       require much more power on 12V, and much less on 3.3V/5V than
       ATX12V PSUs provide.
     * ATX12V 2.x PSUs have power distribution designed for late P4/XP PCs
       and for Athlon 64 and Core Duo PCs. They can be used with earlier
       P4/XP PCs, but the power distribution will be significantly
       suboptimal, so a more powerful ATX12V 2.0 PSU should be used to
       compensate for that discrepancy. ATX12V 2.x PSUs can also be used
       with pre-P4/XP systems, but the power distribution will be greatly
       suboptimal (12V rails will be mostly unused, while the 3.3V/5V
       rails will be overloaded), so this is not recommended.

   Special note: Proprietary brand-name or high-end workstation/server
   designs do not fit into these guidelines. They usually require an
   exactly matching power supply unit.

[[114]edit] Issues with Dell power supplies

   Older Dell computers, particularly those from the [115]Pentium II and
   [116]III times, are notable for using proprietary power wiring on their
   power supplies and motherboards. While the motherboard connectors
   appear to be standard ATX, and will actually fit a standard power
   supply, they are not compatible. Not only have wires been switched from
   one location to another, but the number of wires for a given voltage
   has been changed. Thus, the pins cannot simply be rearranged.[117][2]

   The change affects not only 20-pin ATX connectors, but also auxiliary
   6-pin connectors. Modern Dell systems may use standard ATX
   connectors.[118][3] Dell PC owners should be careful when attempting to
   mix non-Dell motherboards and power supplies, as it can cause damage to
   the power supply or other components. If the power supply color coding
   on the wiring does not match ATX standards, then it is probably
   proprietary. Wiring diagrams for Dell systems are usually available on
   Dell's support page.

[[119]edit] Connectors

   ATX I/O plates

   On the back of the system, some major changes were made. The AT
   standard had only a [120]keyboard connector and expansion slots for
   add-on card backplates. Any other onboard interfaces (such as
   [121]serial and [122]parallel ports) had to be connected via
   [123]flying leads to connectors which were mounted either on spaces
   provided by the case or brackets placed in unused expansion slot
   positions. ATX allowed each motherboard manufacturer to put these ports
   in a rectangular area on the back of the system, with an arrangement
   they could define themselves (though a number of general patterns
   depending on what ports the motherboard offers have been followed by
   most manufacturers). Generally the case comes with a snap out panel,
   also known as an I/O plate, reflecting one of the common arrangements.
   If necessary, I/O plates can be replaced to suit the arrangement on the
   motherboard that is being fitted and the I/O plates are usually
   included when purchasing a motherboard. Panels were also made that
   allowed fitting an AT motherboard in an ATX case.

   ATX also made the [124]PS/2-style[125]mini-DIN keyboard and mouse
   connectors ubiquitous. AT systems used a 5 pin [126]DIN connector for
   the keyboard, and were generally used with serial port mice (although
   PS/2 mouse ports were also found on some systems). Many modern
   motherboards are phasing out the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse
   connectors in favor of the modern standard of [127]USB ports. Other
   legacy connectors that appeared on ATX motherboards but are being
   phased out include 25-pin [128]parallel ports and 9-pin [129]RS-232
   [130]serial ports. In their place are on-board peripheral ports such as
   [131]Ethernet, [132]Firewire, [133]External SATA, [134]audio ports
   (analog/[135]S/PDIF), video ([136]D-sub/[137]DVI/[138]HDMI), and extra
   [139]USB ports.

[[140]edit] Variants

   There exist several ATX-derived form factors that use the same power
   supply, mountings and basic back panel arrangement, but set different
   standards for the size of the board.
   ATX Scale Reference
     width length color in image

   [143]WTX (workstation ATX) 14 inches (355.6 mm) 16.75 inches (425.4 mm)

[[144]edit] Prototypes

   In [145]CeBIT 2008, [146]Foxconn unveiled a Foxconn F1 motherboard
   prototype, the same length as a standard ATX motherboard, but wider to
   accomodate 10 slots.^[147][2] In January 2008, [148]Lian Li unveiled
   Armorsuit PC-P80 case with 10 slots designed for the
   motherboard.^[149][3]
