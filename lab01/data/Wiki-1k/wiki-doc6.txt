   Dispensationalism is a [90]Protestant, [91]Christian, evangelical
   tradition and theology. The name derives from the concept of a
   "dispensation" or administration. Dispensationalists hold that there
   are a series of chronologically successive dispensations, that
   emphasize certain Biblical covenants, and that the nation of Israel is
   distinct from the Church. Most believe that God is going to fulfill His
   promises to national Israel in the process of Israel being revitalized,
   that Christ will rule the world from there upon His return, and they
   deny the teachings of Replacement Theology. The teachings of
   Dispensationalism contain a distinctive [92]eschatological "[93]end
   times" component, as all dispensationalists hold to
   [94]premillennialism and most hold to the [95]pretribulation
   [96]rapture. In other areas of theology, dispensationalists hold to a
   wide range of beliefs within the evangelical and fundamentalist
   spectrum.

[[124]edit] Progressive Revelation

   One of the most important underlying theological concepts for
   dispensationalists is progressive revelation. While some
   nondispensationalists start with progressive revelation in the New
   Testament and refer this revelation back into the Old Testament,
   dispensationalists begin with progressive revelation in the Old
   Testament and read forward in a historical sense. Therefore there is an
   emphasis on a gradually developed unity as seen in the entirety of
   Scripture. Biblical covenants are intricately tied to the
   dispensations. When these Biblical covenants are compared and
   contrasted, the result is a historical ordering of different
   dispensations. Also with regard to the different Biblical covenant
   promises, dispensationalists place emphasis on to whom these promises
   were written, the original recipients. This has led to certain
   fundamental dispensational beliefs, such as a distinction between
   Israel and the church.

[[125]edit] Historical-Grammatical Interpretation

   Another important theological concept is the emphasis on what is
   referred to as the historical-grammatical method of interpretation.
   This is often popularly (but inaccurately) referred to as the "literal"
   interpretation of Scripture. Just as it is with progressive revelation,
   the historical-grammatical method is not a concept or practice that is
   exclusive just to dispensationalists. However, a dispensational
   distinctive is created when the historical-grammatical method of
   interpretation is closely coupled with an emphasis on progressive
   revelation along with the historical development of the covenants in
   Scripture.

[[126]edit] Distinction Between Israel and the Church

   All dispensationalists perceive a clear distinction between Israel and
   the church, particularly as different groups who receive a different
   set of promises. Dispensationalists hold that God provided the nation
   of Israel with specific promises which will be fulfilled at a future
   time in the Jews. The Church has received a different set of promises
   than that of Israel. Most dispensationalists also recognize
   "membership" overlap between Israel and the Church. Jewish Christians
   such as Paul, Peter and John are in this category. While most do not
   believe that Israel and the church are mutually exclusive groups, there
   is a small minority of past and present dispensationalists who do.
   Those who do hold that Israel and the church are mutually exclusive
   include some classical dispensationalists and virtually all
   ultradispensationalists.

   Comparison of Christian millennial interpretations

[[128]edit] Central beliefs

   Dispensationalism hinges on three core tenets:
    1. The Bible is to be taken literally. John F. Walvoord, in his book
       "Prophecy in the New Millennium," provides this explanation:

     "History answers the most important question in prophetic
     interpretation, that is, whether prophecy is to be interpreted
     literally, by giving five hundred examples of precise literal
     fulfillments. The commonly held belief that prophecy is not literal
     and should be interpreted nonliterally has no basis in scriptural
     revelation. Undoubtedly, a nonliteral viewpoint is one of the major
     causes of confusion in prophetic interpretation."

    2. The Church consists of only those saved from the Day of
       [129]Pentecost until the time of the rapture. It is held that the
       Church consists of a small number of Israelites under the election
       of grace in the present dispensation along with a large number of
       Gentiles. (see Scofield note on Rom. 11 and The Mac Arthur New
       Testament Commentary : Romans 9 - 16). During the 70th week of
       Daniel, God will deal specifically with the nation of Israel to
       bring it to national salvation, in which Israelites who have faith
       in Jesus Christ during that time will inherit the promised
       Theocratic Kingdom and the unconditional Covenants God made with
       Israel. Israel will fulfill its role as the Theocratic Covenanted
       Kingdom promised to the nation in [130]Old Testament prophecy.
    3. Israel in the New Testament refers to saved and unsaved Israelites
       who will receive the promises made to them in the Abrahamic
       Covenant, Davidic Covenant and New Covenant. (See The Millennial
       Kingdom by Dr. John F. Walvoord.)

   Dispensationalism takes its name from the idea that biblical history is
   best understood in light of a series of dispensations in the Bible. The
   number of dispensations that are generally held is, at the very least:
   the dispensation of Law, the dispensation of Grace and the dispensation
   of the Kingdom. These three are specifically stated in the [131]Dallas
   Theological Seminary statement of faith. The [132]Scofield Reference
   Bible notes additional dispensations to complete the list:
     * the dispensation of [133]Innocence (Gen 1:13:7), prior to Adam's
       [134]fall,
     * of [135]Conscience (Gen 3:88:22), Adam to Noah,
     * of [136]Government (Gen 9:111:32), Noah to Abraham,
     * of [137]Patriarchal Rule (Gen 12:1Exod 19:25), Abraham to Moses,
     * of the [138]Mosaic Law (Exod 20:1Acts 2:4), Moses to Christ,
     * of [139]Grace (Acts 2:4Rev 20:3 except for
       [140]Hyperdispensationalists and [141]Ultradispensationalists), the
       current church age.
     * of a literal, earthly 1,000-year [142]Millennial Kingdom that has
       yet to come. (Rev 20:420:6).

   Opponents of dispensationalism argue that when Apostle Paul spoke of
   the dispensation of grace, he was not speaking of an age or period of
   time but rather he was speaking of stewardship. However, most
   Dispensationalists teach that in this passage (Eph 3:2), Paul was
   referring to a commission to preach, so this argument is largely
   moot.^[[143]clarification needed]^[144][1]

[[145]edit] Dispensations

   Dispensationalists hold that there are a series of chronologically
   successive dispensations, that emphasize certain Biblical covenants.

   These different dispensations are not separate ways of salvation.
   During each of them man is reconciled to God in only one way, i.e. by
   God's grace through the work of Christ that was accomplished on the
   cross and vindicated in His resurrection. Before the cross, man was
   saved on the basis of Christ's atoning sacrifice to come, through
   believing the revelation thus far given him. Since the cross, man has
   been saved by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom revelation
   and redemption are consummated. On man's part the continuing
   requirement is obedience to revelation of God. This obedience is a
   stewardship of faith. Although the divine revelation unfolds
   progressively, the deposit of truth in earlier time-periods is not
   discarded, rather it is cumulative. Thus conscience (moral
   responsibility) is an abiding truth in human life (Ro. 2:15; 9:1; 2 Co.
   1:12; 4:2), although it does not continue as a dispensation. Similarly,
   the saved of this present dispensation are "not under law" as a
   specific test of obedience to divine revelation (Gal. 5:18; cp. Gal
   2:16; 3:11), yet the law remains an integral part of Dispensational
   teaching, which clarifies that, although Christ fulfilled the law for
   us, by it we have had the knowledge of sin(Rom 7:7), and it is an
   integral part of the Holy Scriptures, which, to the redeemed, are
   profitable for "training in righteousness" (2 Ti. 3:16-17; cp. Ro.
   15:4). The purpose of each dispensation, then, is to place man under a
   specific rule of conduct, but such stewardship is not a condition of
   salvation. In every past dispensation unregenerate man has failed, and
   is failing in the present dispensation, and will fail in the future
   until Eternity arrives. But salvation has been and will continue to be
   available to him by God's grace through faith. (The New Scofield Study
   Bible, NIV 1984 Edition , pg. 3-4)

[[146]edit] Israel and the Church

   The relationship between the ancient nations of [147]Israel and
   [148]Judah (sometimes collectively referred to as Israel or the Jewish
   people) and the [149]church as the people of God is the key
   discriminator between Dispensationalism and other views. In the
   dispensational scheme, the time in which the church operates, known as
   the church age or the Christian dispensation, represents a
   "parenthesis". That is, it is an interruption in God's dealings with
   the Jewish people as a nation as described in the [150]Old Testament,
   and it is the time when the [151]Gospel was preached and [152]salvation
   in the present age is offered to the [153]Gentiles and Jews alike.
   During the present dispensation a small Jewish remnant along with a
   large Gentile number are to be saved and become part of the Church.
   Israel as a nation is partially blinded until the fullness of the
   Gentiles has come. Afterwards however, Gods continued care for the
   Jewish people as a nation will be revealed after the end of the church
   age when Israel will be restored to their land and will accept
   [154]Jesus as their [155]messiah (compare [156]Zech 12:8-10) and
   therefore "all Israel shall be saved" ([157]Rom 11:25-29). That is,
   those of Israel who come to faith in Jesus Christ and physically live
   through the Great Tribulation will be saved from the Beast and the
   false prophet, all who come to attack Israel will be defeated by the
   coming of Jesus Christ Himself with His church, and thus Israel will be
   brought to national salvation. Our Lord Jesus Christ will then sit on
   the throne of David and will begin the Theocratic Davidic Kingdom which
   is promised in numerous places in the Old Testament, in which believers
   and Christ reign together on the earth from Israel( Isa. 9:6-7, Isa.
   11, 65:17-25, 66:22-24, Zech. 14:9, Acts 1:6-7, Matt. 25:31-34, Rev.
   5:10, 20:4-6 ) .

   Contrasted with this view are [158]Roman Catholicism, [159]Eastern
   Orthodoxy, [160]Anglicanism, [161]Covenant Theology, and [162]New
   Covenant Theology. New Covenant Theology advocates [163]supersessionism
   where the church replaces the Jews as God's [164]chosen people. In
   Catholicism and Covenantalism, the church is not as a replacement for
   the nation of Israel but an expansion of it where Gentiles are, in the
   words of [165]Romans 11, "grafted into" the existing covenant
   community.^[166][2]

   All of these groups expect there will be an influx (or return,
   depending on which view one is considering) of Jews to the church
   before the [167]second coming of Christ. However, dispensationalists
   object to Roman Catholicism and Covenant Theology because
   dispensationalists do not view the church as the promised covenanted
   kingdom in Old Testament prophecy. They believe such a kingdom is still
   promised to the Jews during the New Testament era (for instance, in
   [168]Acts 3:19-21). Dispensationalists further believe that the
   promises regarding the throne of David will be fulfilled on the earth
   as Jesus reigns over the earth from Israel at his second
   coming.^[169][3]

[[170]edit] Eschatology

   Dispensationalists are [171]premillenialists who affirm a future,
   literal 1,000 year reign of Jesus Christ which merges with and
   continues on to the eternal state in the "new heavens and the new
   earth" ([172]Rev. 21), and they hold that the millennial kingdom will
   be [173]theocratic in nature and not mainly [174]soteriological, as it
   is viewed by George Ladd and others who hold to a non-dispensational
   form of premillennialism. Dispensationalism is known for its views
   respecting the nation of Israel during this millennial kingdom reign,
   in which Israel as a nation plays a major role and regains a king, a
   land, and an everlasting kingdom. Dispensationalism is also uniquely
   associated with belief in the [175]pre-tribulation rapture of the
   church.

   Not all dispensationalists are pre-tribulationists, however, and there
   are those who are mid-tribulational and post-tribulational who also
   adhere to the dispensationalist ideology.^[176][4]

[[179]edit] History

[[180]edit] Before Darby

   According to [181]Charles Ryrie, "informed dispensationalists" do not
   "assert that the system was taught in postapostolic times.... They
   recognize that, as a system, dispensationalism was largely formulated
   by [182]Darby" in the 1800s, though they also contend that "the
   outlines of a dispensationalist approach to the Scriptures are found
   much earlier."^[183][5]

   For instance, they look to [184]Augustine of Hippo, who wrote in his
   book "[185]On catechizing the uninstructed-Chapter 22" about a plan of
   seven ages (1. Adam-Noah, 2.Noah-Abraham, 3. Abraham-David, 4.
   David-exile, 5. exile-incarnation, 6. incarnation-[186]parousia, 7.
   millennium). [187]Isidore of Seville (560-636) and the [188]Venerable
   Bede (673-735) also saw it in this way.

   [189]Joachim of Fiore (1135-1202) and [190]Thomas Brightman (1557-1607)
   developed a different teaching. They related the seven churches in the
   [191]Book of Revelation to seven ages in the history of the church.
   They also divided the history in three frames: time of the father (Old
   Testament), time of the son (New Testament), and finally the time of
   renewing.

   [192]Robert Pont (1524-1606), a Scottish theologian, connected
   prophecies of the [193]Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation and
   also got seven ages of mankind.

[[194]edit] United Kingdom

   Born out of the religious environment in [195]England and [196]Ireland
   in the 1820s, systematized dispensationalism began with the
   [197]Plymouth Brethren movement, especially the teachings of [198]John
   Nelson Darby (18001882).

   Darby built on a number of themes that were common among the more
   radical [199]Calvinists in the [200]Evangelical movement of the early
   19th century, but he elaborated a more complex and complete system for
   interpreting the Bible than had previous writers. Scofields approach to
   interpreting the Bible largely held that it should be understood as any
   other speech should be understood, that in keeping with figures of
   speech, similies and metaphors should be taken to mean exactly what it
   said.^[[201]citation needed]

   The Plymouth Brethren movement, essentially a reaction against Anglican
   and Roman Catholic [202]ecclesiology, became known for its
   anti-denominational, anti-clerical, and anti-creedal stance. In 1848,
   the Plymouth Brethren split into an "Exclusive" group led by Darby and
   an "Open" group. Darby's views became dominant among the Exclusive
   Brethren, but were not widespread among Open Brethren until the 1870s
   or 1880s.^[[203]citation needed]

[[204]edit] North America

   Dispensationalism was first introduced to North America by [205]John
   Inglis (18131879), through a monthly magazine called Waymarks in the
   Wilderness (published intermittently between 1854 and
   1872)^[[206]citation needed]. In 1866, Inglis organized the
   [207]Believers' Meeting for Bible Study, which introduced
   dispensationalist ideas to a small but influential circle of American
   evangelicals. After Inglis death, [208]James H. Brookes (18301898), a
   pastor in St. Louis, organized the [209]Niagara Bible Conference to
   continue the dissemination of dispensationalist ideas.
   Dispensationalism was boosted after [210]Dwight L. Moody (18371899)
   learned of dispensational truth from an unidentified member of the
   Brethren in 1872. Moody became close to Brookes and other
   dispensationalists, and encouraged the spread of dispensationalism, but
   apparently never learned the nuances of the dispensationalist system.

   Dispensationalism began to evolve during this time, most significantly
   when a significant body of dispensationalists proposed the
   "pre-tribulation" [211]Rapture. Dispensationalist leaders in Moody's
   circle include [212]Reuben Archer Torrey (18561928), [213]James M. Gray
   (18511925), [214]Cyrus I. Scofield (18431921), [215]William J. Erdman
   (18331923), [216]A. C. Dixon (18541925), [217]A. J. Gordon (18361895)
   and [218]William Eugene Blackstone, author of the bestselling book of
   the 1800s titled, "Jesus is Coming" (Endorsed by Torrey and Erdman).
   These men were activist evangelists who promoted a host of Bible
   conferences and other missionary and evangelistic efforts. They also
   gave the dispensationalist movement institutional permanence by
   assuming leadership of the new independent Bible institutes such as the
   [219]Moody Bible Institute (1886), the Bible Institute of Los
   Angelesnow [220]Biola University (1907), and the Philadelphia College
   of the Biblenow [221]Philadelphia Biblical University (1913). The
   network of related institutes that soon sprang up became the nucleus
   for the spread of American dispensationalism.

   The energetic efforts of [222]C.I. Scofield and his associates
   introduced dispensationalism to a wider audience in America and
   bestowed a measure of respectability through his [223]Scofield
   Reference Bible. The publication of the Scofield Reference Bible in
   1909 by the [224]Oxford University Press was something of an innovative
   literary coup for the movement, since for the first time, overtly
   dispensationalist notes were added to the pages of the biblical text.
   The Scofield Reference Bible became the leading Bible used by
   independent Evangelicals and Fundamentalists in the U.S. for the next
   sixty years. Evangelist and Bible teacher [225]Lewis Sperry Chafer
   (18711952), who was strongly influenced by C.I. Scofield, founded
   [226]Dallas Theological Seminary in 1924, which has become the flagship
   of Dispensationalism in America. More recently, the [227]Baptist Bible
   Seminary in Clark Summit, [228]Pennsylvania (USA), has become another
   center of dispensationalism.

   The so-called "Grace Movement", which began in the 1930s with the
   teaching ministries of J.C. OHair, Cornelius R. Stam, Henry Hudson and
   Charles Baker has been mischaracterized as "ultra" or "hyper"
   dispensationalism (an actual misnomer according to the etymology of the
   Greek word base for "dispensation"). But the term still serves to
   distinguish a theological system that departs from the tenets of
   Dispensationlism.

   The contrasts between law and grace, prophecy and mystery, Israel and
   the Church, the body of Christ were energized by Scofield,
   [229]Barnhouse and [230]Ironside in the hearts of these men and studied
   and proclaimed by O'Hair, Stam and a host of other "grace" teachers. It
   is however contended by dispensational teachers such as Charles C.
   Ryrie, Dwight J. Pentecost and Arnold Fruchtenbaum that
   [231][1]ultradispensationalism (or the grace movement if you will) is
   far enough removed from dispensationalism to not any longer be
   dispensationalism at all. "Ultra" Dispensationalists hold to the belief
   that the Church wasn't started till the stoning of Stephen. The first
   reference to the church the body of Christ is in Romans and unlike most
   other dispensationalists they believe that the church started at Romans
   1 rather than Acts 2 or Acts 28. Ultradispensationalists believe that
   the books of Paul(Romans through Philemon)are written for the church
   today and the books after (Hebrews through Revalation) are written for
   the Hebrew church of the tribulation. A large number of UD's believe
   that the church has access to the inspired Word of God and that God has
   perfectly preserved the Bible in the form of the King James Version.
   This teaching is propagated by organizations such as Grace School of
   the Bible, Grace Alive Ministries, RGMI, and pastors Thomas M. Bruscha,
   Richard Jordan, Mike Tiry, and Tracy Plessinger.

   Dispensationalism has come to dominate the American Evangelical scene,
   especially among [232]nondenominational Bible churches, many
   [233]Baptists, and most [234]Pentecostal and [235]Charismatic groups.

[[236]edit] Influence

   Dispensationalism has had a number of effects on Protestantism, at
   least as it is practiced in the [237]United States. Some, but not many
   dispensationalists, usually of the [238]Fundamentalist variety
   (although, I can't think of any that aren't Fundamentalists), have
   continued to teach that a Pope may be the [239]False Prophet of the
   [240]book of Revelation. They view the false Religious system of Rev.
   17 as representing all the false churches of professing Christianity
   together who deny or reject the teachings of Scripture or the Person of
   Jesus Christ and the gospel message, as well as every false system in
   the history of mankind (Mat 23:35 w/Rev 18:10, 24). In otherwords, such
   false churches recognize a different Jesus Christ and different gospel
   which the Apostle warns the Church against ( Gal. 1: 6-9, 2 Cor. 11:3-4
   ). These are the false religions of the world to be extant at the time
   of the 70th week of Daniel, at the beginning of the Tribulation period.

   Dispensationalism rejects the notion of [241]supersessionism, sees the
   Jewish people as the true people of God, and sees the modern [242]State
   of Israel as identical to the Israel of the Bible. John Nelson Darby
   taught, and most subsequent dispensationalists have consistently
   maintained, that God looks upon the [243]Jews as his chosen people even
   as they remain in rejection of Jesus Christ, and God continues to have
   a place for them in the dispensational, prophetic scheme of things.
   Dispensationalists teach that a remnant within the nation of Israel
   will be born again, called of God, and by grace brought to realize they
   crucified their Messiah. Dispensationalism is unique in teaching that
   the Church is a provisional parenthesis, until the Jewish remnant
   finally recognize Jesus as their promised Messiah during the trials
   that come upon the Jews in the [244]Great Tribulation after the Church
   is raptured. Darby's prophecies envision Judaism as continuing to enjoy
   God's protection literally to the End of Time, and teach that God has a
   separate 'program', to use J. Dwight Pentecost's term, in the
   prophecies for Jews apart from the Church. Dispensationalists believe
   that God, is currently dealing with the church, recognized in the New
   Testament as the "body of Christ," and "house of God," and as a mystery
   unknown in Old Testament times. They teach that God has not forgotten
   His eternal covenants with Israel.

   While stressing that God has not forsaken those physically related to
   Abraham, dispensationalists do affirm of the necessity for Jews to
   follow the example of the entire early church (up until Acts 10:34
   ff.)and hold that God made unconditional Covenants with Israel as a
   people and nation which was based on God's sovereign grace with Israel
   as a nation under the Abrahamic Covenant, Palestinian Covenant, Davidic
   Covenant and the New Covenant and that they must receive Jesus as
   Messiah. Paul mentions the meaning of faith and salvation from the
   penalty of sin in Jesus Christ.

[[245]edit] Judaism

   Christian Dispensationalists sometimes embrace what some critics have
   pejoratively called Judeophiliaranging from support of the state of
   [246]Israel, to observing traditional Jewish holidays and practicing
   traditionally Jewish religious rituals. (See also [247]Jewish
   Christians and [248]Judaizers.) Dispensationalists believe in and
   support the state of Israel, recognize its existence as God revealing
   His Will for the Last Days, and reject anti-Semitism.

[[249]edit] Messianic Judaism

   Dispensationalists tend to have special interest in the Jews because
   the dispensationalist hermeneutic interprets Jews as a continuance of
   God's [250]chosen people. [251]Messianic Judaism, however, rejects
   dispensationalism in favor of [252]Olive Tree Theology^[253][6]. The
   name "Olive Tree Theology" refers to the passages of Romans 11:17-18 If
   some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive, were
   grafted in among them and have become equal sharers in the rich root of
   the olive tree, then don't boast as if you were better than the
   branches!" (Romans 11:17-18) Jews who accept dispensationalism are
   instead called Hebrew Christians.^[[254]citation needed]

[[255]edit] Antichrist

   Some dispensationalists, such as the late fundamentalist [256]Jerry
   Falwell, have asserted that the beast [257]Antichrist will be a Jew,
   based on a belief that the Antichrist will falsely seem to some Jews to
   fulfill prophesies of the Messiah more accurately than Jesus
   did^[258][7].

   However, many dispensationalists do not accept this belief, and claim
   that a number of scriptures do not cite any evidence, such as Daniel
   9:27.

   Such dispensationalists claim that this "prince" will be of the same
   people that destroyed the Jewish city, i.e., of Roman origin and
   therefore will not be Jewish.

   In turn, this "prince" will stand up "against the Prince of princes"
   and destroy many "by peace" (Dan 8:25); and will be responsible for the
   false "peace and safety" that will precede the destructive day of the
   Lord (1 Thess 5:23). Some believe this man will be a Jew, based in part
   on John 5:43, where the Lord stated that the unbelieving Jews would
   receive another who "shall come in his own name" (as opposed to the
   Lord Himself, who came in the Father's name). Further evidence is taken
   from Daniel 11:37, "Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor
   the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself
   above all", although in a passage as late as Daniel, a better
   translation is probably, "He will reject the gods (Eloha) of his
   fathers." The prophet Daniel refers to this man as "a vile person", who
   will "obtain the kingdom by flatteries" (Dan 11:21). This belief is not
   essential to dispensationalism^[[259]citation needed].

   Darby himself taught the Antichrist will be a Jew, and the Beast, a
   separate person, will be the political leader of the revived Roman
   empire. ^[260][8].

[[261]edit] World politics

   Dispensationalism teaches that Christians should not expect spiritual
   good from earthly governments, or success from churches to be part of
   Christ's kingdom enlarging ministry since the Kingdom of God is usually
   seen as yet future. Instead, people should expect social conditions to
   decline as the end times draw nearer. Dispensationalist readings of
   prophecies (such as Daniel 9:27, And he [the Antichrist] will make a
   firm covenant [a peace contract] with the many [the nation of Israel
   along with the nations that oppose it] . . . ) often teach that the
   Antichrist will appear to the world as a peacemaker. This makes some
   dispensationalists suspicious of all forms of power, religious and
   secular, and especially of human attempts to form international
   organizations for peace, such as the [262]United Nations. Almost all
   dispensationalists reject the idea that a lasting peace can be attained
   by human effort in the [263]Middle East, and believe instead that "wars
   and rumors of wars" (cf. Matt 24:6) will increase as the end times
   approach. Dispensationalist beliefs often underlie the religious and
   political movement of [264]Christian Zionism.

   Dispensationalists teach that churches which do not insist on Biblical
   literalism set forth an inconsistent method of interpretation with
   respect to the area of Bible prophecy and view it as a step towards
   theological liberalism which rejects Scripture as being inerrant. This
   casts suspicion on attempts to create church organizations that cross
   [265]denominational boundaries such as the [266]World Council of
   Churches. (See also [267]ecumenism.)

[[268]edit] United States politics

   Political analyst [269]Richard Allen Greene has argued that
   dispensationalism has had a major influence on the foreign policy of
   the United States. This influence has included support for the state of
   [270]Israel.^[271][9]

[[272]edit] Fiction

   Dispensationalist themes form the basis of the successful [273]Left
   Behind series of books. However, not all dispensationalists agree with
   the theology of authors [274]Tim LaHaye and [275]Jerry Jenkins.
