   E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a [32]1982 American [33]science fiction
   film co-produced and directed by [34]Steven Spielberg, written by
   [35]Melissa Mathison and starring [36]Henry Thomas, [37]Robert
   MacNaughton, [38]Drew Barrymore, [39]Dee Wallace and [40]Peter Coyote.
   It tells the story of Elliott (played by Thomas), a lonely boy who
   befriends a friendly [41]alien, dubbed "E.T.", who is stranded on
   [42]Earth. Elliott and his siblings help the alien return home while
   attempting to keep it hidden from their mother and the government.

   The concept for E.T. was based on an [43]imaginary friend Spielberg
   created after his parents' divorce. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and
   developed a new story from the stalled science fiction/horror film
   project [44]Night Skies. The film was shot from September to December
   1981 in [45]California on a budget of US$10.5 million. Unlike most
   motion pictures, the film was shot in roughly [46]chronological order,
   to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast.

   Released by [47]Universal Studios, E.T. was a [48]blockbuster,
   surpassing [49]Star Wars to become the most financially successful film
   released to that point. Critics acclaimed it as a timeless story of
   friendship, and it ranks as the [50]best science fiction film ever made
   in a [51]Rotten Tomatoes survey. The alien became the subject of
   analogies for [52]Jesus. The film was rereleased in [53]1985, and then
   again in [54]2002 with altered special effects and additional scenes.
   Spielberg believes E.T. epitomizes his work.^[55][4]

[[65]edit] Plot

   The film opens in a [66]California forest as a group of [67]alien
   [68]botanists collect vegetation samples. U.S. government agents appear
   and the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving one of their own behind
   in their haste. The scene shifts to a suburban California home, where a
   boy named Elliott ([69]Henry Thomas) plays servant to his older
   brother, Michael ([70]Robert MacNaughton), and his friends ([71]K. C.
   Martel, [72]Sean Frye and [73]C. Thomas Howell). As he fetches pizza,
   Elliott discovers the stranded alien, who promptly flees. Despite his
   family's disbelief, Elliott leaves [74]Reese's Pieces candy in the
   forest to lure it into his bedroom. Before he goes to bed, Elliott
   notices the alien imitating his movements.

   Elliott feigns illness the next morning to avoid school so he can play
   with the alien. That afternoon, Michael and their younger sister,
   Gertie ([75]Drew Barrymore), meet the alien. Their mother, Mary
   ([76]Dee Wallace), hears the noise and comes upstairs. Michael, Gertie
   and the alien hide in the closet while Elliott assures his mother that
   everything is all right. Michael and Gertie promise to keep the alien a
   secret from their mother. Deciding to keep the alien, the children
   begin to ask it about its origin. It answers by levitating balls to
   represent its [77]solar system, and further demonstrates its powers by
   reviving a dead plant.

   At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic
   connection with the alien. Elliott becomes irrational due partly to the
   alien's intoxication from drinking beer. Elliott then begins freeing
   all the frogs from a [78]dissection class. As the alien watches
   [79]John Wayne kiss [80]Maureen O'Hara in [81]The Quiet Man, Elliott's
   psychic link causes him to kiss a girl ([82]Erika Eleniak) he likes in
   the same manner.
   E.T. making Elliott's bike fly to the forest.

   The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says in
   response to her watching [83]Sesame Street and, through Elliott's
   urging, dubs itself as "E.T." It enlists Elliott's help in building a
   device to "phone home" by using a [84]Speak & Spell toy. Michael starts
   to notice that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring
   to himself as "we." On [85]Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as
   a ghost so they can sneak it out of the house. Elliott and E.T. ride a
   bicycle to the forest, where E.T. makes a successful call home. The
   next morning, Elliott wakes up to find E.T. gone, and returns home to
   his distressed family. Michael finds E.T. dying in the forest, and
   takes the alien to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened
   when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, before
   government agents invade the house.

   Scientists set up a medical facility in the house, [86]quarantining
   Elliott and E.T. The link between E.T. and Elliott disappears as E.T.
   appears to die. Elliott is left alone with the motionless alien when he
   notices a dead flower, the plant E.T. had previous revived, coming back
   to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that its people are returning.
   Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a
   chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining Elliott and E.T. as they
   attempt to evade the authorities by bicycle. Suddenly facing a
   dead-end, they escape as E.T. uses [87]telekinesis to lift them into
   the air and toward the forest. Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s
   heart glows as it prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie and "Keys"
   ([88]Peter Coyote), a government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to
   Michael and Gertie, and before entering the spaceship, tells Elliott
   "I'll be right here," pointing its glowing finger to Elliott's head.

   Spielberg auditioned more than 300 children for the roles.^[102][5]
   Having worked with [103]Cary Guffey on [104]Close Encounters of the
   Third Kind, he felt confident in working with a cast composed mostly of
   [105]child actors, rather than young adults.^[106][6] Robert Fisk
   suggested Henry Thomas for the role of Elliott.^[107][7] Thomas, who
   auditioned in an [108]Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in
   the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised
   scene.^[109][6] Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing
   tears.^[110][8] MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael,
   sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt Drew
   Barrymore had the right imagination for the film after she impressed
   him with a story that she led a [111]punk rock band.^[112][7] Spielberg
   enjoyed working with the children, noting that the experience made him
   feel ready to become a father.^[113][9]

   The major voice work for E.T. was performed by [114]Pat Welsh, an
   elderly woman who lived in [115]Marin County, California. Welsh smoked
   two packets of cigarettes a day, which gave her voice a quality that
   sound effects creator [116]Ben Burtt liked. She spent nine-and-a-half
   hours recording her part, and was paid $380 by Burtt for her
   services.^[117][10] Burtt also recorded 16 other people and various
   animals to create E.T.'s "voice". These included Spielberg; [118]Debra
   Winger; Burtt's sleeping wife, who had a cold; a burp from his [119]USC
   film professor; and raccoons, sea otters and
   horses.^[120][11]^[121][12]

   Doctors working at the [122]USC Medical Center were recruited to play
   the doctors who try to save E.T. after [123]government agents take over
   Elliott's home. Spielberg felt that actors in the roles, performing
   lines of highly technical medical dialogue, would come across as
   unnatural.^[124][9] During post-production, Spielberg decided to cut a
   scene featuring [125]Harrison Ford as Elliott's principal. The scene
   featured Elliott being reprimanded for his behavior in science class,
   and saw Elliott's chair being [126]levitated while E.T. was levitating
   his "phone" equipment up the staircase with Gertie.^[127][7]

[[128]edit] Production

   After his parents' divorce in 1960, Spielberg filled the void with an
   [129]imaginary alien companion. Spielberg said that E.T. was "a friend
   who could be the brother I never had and a father that I didn't feel I
   had anymore."^[130][13] During 1978, Spielberg announced he would shoot
   a film entitled Growing Up, which he would film in 28 days. The project
   was set aside because of delays on [131]1941, but the concept of making
   a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with
   Spielberg.^[132][10] He also thought about a follow-up to [133]Close
   Encounters of the Third Kind, and began to develop a darker project he
   had planned with [134]John Sayles called [135]Night Skies in which
   malevolent aliens terrorize a family.^[136][10]

   Filming [137]Raiders of the Lost Ark in [138]Tunisia left Spielberg
   bored, and memories of his childhood creation resurfaced.^[139][14] He
   told screenwriter [140]Melissa Mathison about Night Skies, and
   developed a subplot from the failed project, in which Buddy, the only
   friendly alien, befriends an [141]autistic child. Buddy's abandonment
   on Earth in the script's final scene inspired the E.T.
   concept.^[142][14] Mathison wrote a first draft titled E.T. and Me in
   eight weeks,^[143][14] which Spielberg considered perfect.^[144][7] The
   script went through two more drafts, which deleted an "[145]Eddie
   Haskell"-esque friend of Elliott. The chase sequence was also created,
   and Spielberg also suggested having the scene where E.T. got
   drunk.^[146][10] [147]Columbia Pictures, which had been producing Night
   Skies, met Spielberg to discuss the script. The studio passed on it,
   calling it "a wimpy [148]Walt Disney movie", so Spielberg approached
   the more receptive [149]Sid Sheinberg, president of [150]MCA.^[151][15]

   [152]Ed Verreaux created a $700,000 prototype for E.T., which Spielberg
   deemed useless.^[153][10] [154]Carlo Rambaldi, who designed the aliens
   for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was hired to design the
   [155]animatronics of E.T. Rambaldi's own painting Women of Delta led
   him to give the creature a unique, extendable neck.^[156][7] The
   creature's face was inspired by the faces of [157]Carl Sandburg,
   [158]Albert Einstein and [159]Ernest Hemingway.^[160][16] Producer
   [161]Kathleen Kennedy visited the [162]Jules Stein Eye Institute to
   study real and glass eyeballs. She hired Institute staffers to create
   E.T.'s eyes, which she felt were particularly important in engaging the
   audience.^[163][6] Four E.T. heads were created for filming, one as the
   main animatronic and the others for facial expressions, as well as a
   costume.^[164][16] Two [165]dwarfs, [166]Tamara De Treaux and Pat
   Bilon,^[167][10] as well as 12-year-old Matthew De Meritt, who was born
   without legs,^[168][17] took turns wearing the costume, depending on
   what scene was being filmed.^[169][7] Caprice Roth, a professional
   mime, filled prosthetics to play E.T.'s hands.^[170][6] The finished
   creature was created in three months at the cost of $1.5
   million.^[171][18] Spielberg declared it was "something that only a
   mother could love."^[172][7] [173]Mars, Incorporated found E.T. so ugly
   that the company refused to allow [174]M&M's to be used in the film,
   believing the creature would frighten children. This allowed the
   [175]Hershey Company the opportunity to market [176]Reese's
   Pieces.^[177][19]

   E.T. began shooting in September 1981.^[178][20] The project was filmed
   under the cover name A Boy's Life, as Spielberg did not want anyone to
   discover and plagiarize the plot. The actors had to read the script
   behind closed doors, and everyone on set had to wear an ID
   card.^[179][6] The shoot began with two days at a high school in
   [180]Culver City, and the crew spent the next 11 days moving between
   locations at [181]Northridge and [182]Tujunga.^[183][10] The house
   scenes were shot in Lonzo Street. The next 42 days were spent at
   [184]Laird International Studios in Culver City, for the interiors of
   Elliott's home. The crew shot at a [185]redwood forest near
   [186]Crescent City for the last six days of
   production.^[187][10]^[188][14] Spielberg shot the film in roughly
   chronological order to achieve convincingly emotional performances from
   his cast. In the scene in which Michael first encounters the alien, the
   creature's appearance caused MacNaughton to jump back and knock down
   the shelves behind him. The chronological shoot gave the young actors
   an emotional experience as they bonded with E.T., making the hospital
   sequences more moving.^[189][9] Spielberg ensured the puppeteers kept
   away from the set to maintain the illusion of a real alien. For the
   first time in his career, he did not [190]storyboard most of the film,
   in order to facilitate spontaneity in the performances.^[191][20] The
   film was shot so adults, except for Dee Wallace, are never seen from
   the waist up in the first half of the film, as a tribute to the
   cartoons of [192]Tex Avery.^[193][7] The shoot was completed in 61
   days, four days ahead of schedule.^[194][14]

   Longtime Spielberg collaborator [195]John Williams composed the musical
   score for E.T. Williams described his challenge as creating a score
   that would generate sympathy for such an odd-looking creature. As with
   their previous collaborations, Spielberg liked every theme Williams
   composed and had it included. Spielberg loved the music for the final
   chase so much that he edited the sequence to suit it.^[196][21]

[[197]edit] Themes

   Spielberg drew the story of E.T. from the divorce of his own
   parents;^[198][22] Gary Arnold of [199]The Washington Post called the
   film "essentially a spiritual autobiography, a portrait of the
   filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent,
   mystical imagination".^[200][23] References to Spielberg's childhood
   occur throughout: Elliott feigns illness by holding his thermometer to
   a light bulb while covering his face with a heating pad, a trick
   frequently employed by the young Spielberg.^[201][24] Michael's picking
   on Elliott echoes Spielberg's teasing of his younger sisters,^[202][7]
   and Michael's evolution from tormentor to protector reflects how
   Spielberg had to take care of his sisters after their father
   left.^[203][9]

   Critics have focused on the parallels between the life of E.T. and
   Elliott, who is "alienated" by the loss of his
   father.^[204][25]^[205][26] [206]A.O. Scott of [207]The New York Times
   wrote that while E.T. "is the more obvious and desperate foundling",
   Elliott "suffers in his own way from the want of a home"^[208][27]
   (coincidentally, E.T. is the first and last letter of Eliott's
   name).^[209][28] At the film's heart is the theme of growing up. Critic
   Henry Sheehan described the film as a retelling of [210]Peter Pan from
   the perspective of a Lost Boy (Elliott): E.T. cannot survive physically
   on Earth, as Pan could not survive emotionally in [211]Neverland;
   government scientists take the place of Neverlands pirates.^[212][29]
   [213]Vincent Canby of The New York Times similarly observed that the
   film "freely recycles elements from [...] [214]Peter Pan and [215]The
   Wizard of Oz".^[216][30] Some critics have suggested that Spielberg's
   portrayal of suburbia is very dark, contrary to popular belief.
   According to A.O. Scott, "The suburban milieu, with its unsupervised
   children and unhappy parents, its broken toys and brand-name junk food,
   could have come out of a [217]Raymond Carver story."^[218][27] Charles
   Taylor of [219]Salon.com wrote, "Spielberg's movies, despite the way
   they're often characterized, are not Hollywood idealizations of
   families and the suburbs. The homes here bear what the cultural critic
   Karal Ann Marling called 'the marks of hard use'."^[220][22]
   Spielberg admitted this scene triggered speculation as to whether the
   film was a religious parable.^[221][31]

   Other critics found religious parallels between E.T. and
   [222]Jesus.^[223][32]^[224][33] Andrew Nigels described the story of
   E.T. as "crucifixion by military science" and "resurrection by love and
   faith".^[225][34] According to Spielberg biographer [226]Joseph
   McBride, Universal Studios appealed directly to the Christian market,
   with a poster reminiscent of [227]Michelangelo's [228]Creation of Adam
   and a logo reading "Peace".^[229][14] Spielberg answered that he did
   not intend the film to be a religious parable, joking, "If I ever went
   to my mother and said, 'Mom, I've made this movie that's a Christian
   parable,' what do you think she'd say? She has a [230]kosher restaurant
   on Pico and Doheny in Los Angeles."^[231][31]

   As a substantial body of film criticism has built up around E.T.,
   numerous writers have analyzed the film in other ways as well. E.T. has
   been interpreted as a modern [232]fairy tale^[233][35] and in
   psychoanalytic terms.^[234][35]^[235][26] Producer Kathleen Kennedy
   noted that an important theme of E.T. is [236]tolerance, which would be
   central to future Spielberg films such as [237]Schindler's
   List.^[238][7] Having been a [239]loner as a teenager, Spielberg
   described the film as "a minority story".^[240][36] Spielberg's
   characteristic theme of communication is partnered with the ideal of
   mutual understanding: he has suggested that the story's central
   alien-human friendship is an analogy for how real-world adversaries can
   learn to overcome their differences.^[241][37]

[[242]edit] Reception

   E.T. was previewed in [243]Houston, Texas, where it received high marks
   from viewers.^[244][14] The film premiered at the closing gala of the
   May 1982 [245]Cannes Film Festival,^[246][38] and was released in the
   United States on June 11, 1982. It opened at number one with a gross of
   $11 million, and stayed at the top of the box office for six weeks. It
   fluctuated between the first and second positions until January. By the
   end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $359.2 million
   domestically.^[247][39] Spielberg earned $500,000 a day from his share
   of the profits.^[248][40]^[249][41] The Hershey Company's profits rose
   65% due to the film's prominent use of Reese's Pieces.^[250][19] The
   film was rereleased on July 19, 1985,^[251][42] and grossed $40 million
   domestically.^[252][2] E.T. was released on [253]VHS and [254]laserdisc
   on October 27, 1988; to combat piracy, the videocassettes were colored
   green.^[255][8] In North America alone, VHS sales came to $75
   million.^[256][43]
   Spielberg with President [257]Ronald Reagan and [258]Nancy Reagan, fans
   of the film, in 1986

   Critics acclaimed E.T. as a classic. [259]Roger Ebert wrote, "This is
   not simply a good movie. It is one of those movies that brush away our
   cautions and win our hearts."^[260][38] [261]Michael Sragow of
   [262]Rolling Stone called Spielberg "a [263]space age [264]Jean
   Renoir... [F]or the first time, [he] has put his breathtaking technical
   skills at the service of his deepest feelings."^[265][44] [266]Leonard
   Maltin called it the best film of the year.^[267][45] [268]George Will
   was one of the few to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive
   notions about childhood and science.^[269][46]

   There were allegations that the film was plagiarized from a 1967
   script, [270]The Alien, by celebrated [271]Bengali director
   [272]Satyajit Ray. Ray stated, "E.T. would not have been possible
   without my script of The Alien being available throughout the United
   States in mimeographed copies." Spielberg denied this claim, stating,
   "I was a kid in high school when his script was circulating in
   Hollywood."^[273][47]

   E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial holds a 98% "fresh" rating on [274]Rotten
   Tomatoes, making it the best reviewed science fiction film on the
   site.^[275][48] It has a [276]Metacritic score of 94, categorized by
   the website as "universal acclaim".^[277][49] In addition to the many
   impressed critics, President [278]Ronald Reagan and first lady
   [279]Nancy Reagan were moved by the film after a screening at the White
   House on June 27, 1982.^[280][41] [281]Princess Diana was in tears
   after watching the film.^[282][7] On September 17, 1982, the film was
   screened at the United Nations, and Spielberg received the U.N. Peace
   Medal.^[283][50]

   The film was nominated for nine Oscars at the [284]55th Academy Awards,
   including Best Picture. [285]Gandhi won that award, but its director,
   [286]Richard Attenborough, declared, "I was certain that not only would
   E.T. win, but that it should win. It was inventive, powerful, [and]
   wonderful. I make more mundane movies."^[287][51] It won four Academy
   AwardsBest Original Music Score, Sound, Sound Effects Editing and
   Visual Effects. At the [288]Golden Globes, the film won Best Picture in
   the Drama category and Best Score; it was also nominated for Best
   Director, Best Screenplay and Best New Male Star for Henry Thomas. The
   [289]Los Angeles Film Critics Association awarded the film Best
   Picture, Best Director and a "New Generation Award" for Melissa
   Mathison.^[290][52] The film won [291]Saturn Awards for Best Science
   Fiction Film, Best Writing, Best Special Effects, Best Music and Best
   Poster Art, while Henry Thomas, Robert McNaughton, and Drew Barrymore
   won [292]Young Artist Awards. In addition to his Golden Globe and
   Saturn, composer [293]John Williams won a [294]Grammy and a [295]BAFTA
   for the score. E.T. was also honored abroad: the film won the Best
   Foreign Language Film award at the Blue Ribbon in Japan, Cinema Writers
   Circle Awards in Spain, Csar Awards in France, and David di Donatello
   in Italy.^[296][53]
   Makeshift communicator used by E.T. to phone home

   In [297]American Film Institute polls, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial has
   been voted the 24th greatest film of all time,^[298][54] the 44th most
   thrilling,^[299][55] and the sixth most uplifting.^[300][56] Other AFI
   polls rated it as having the 14th greatest music score^[301][57] and as
   the third greatest science-fiction film.^[302][58] The line "E.T. phone
   home" was ranked 15th on [303]AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes
   list,^[304][59] and 48th on [305]Premiere's top movie quote
   list.^[306][60] In 2005, the film topped a [307]Channel 4 poll of the
   100 greatest family films,^[308][61] and was also listed by [309]Time
   as one of the 100 best films ever made.^[310][62] In 2003,
   [311]Entertainment Weekly called the film the eighth most
   "tear-jerking";^[312][63] in 2007, in a survey of both films and
   television series, the magazine declared E.T. the seventh greatest work
   of science-fiction media in the past 25 years.^[313][64] [314]The Times
   also named E.T. as their ninth favorite alien in a film, calling it
   "one of the best-loved non-humans in popular culture".^[315][65] In
   1994, E.T. was selected for preservation in the U.S. [316]National Film
   Registry.^[317][66]

[[318]edit] 20th anniversary version

   The 20th anniversary version of the film replaces the guns, used by the
   police, with walkie-talkies.

   An extended version of the film, including altered special effects, was
   released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered
   Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the
   animatronics. [319]Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by
   [320]Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots,
   including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being
   spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to
   include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original
   version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie
   telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest. Spielberg did not add the
   scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too
   drastically. Having become a father, Spielberg was more sensitive about
   the scene where gun-wielding federal agents threaten Elliott and his
   escaping friends; he digitally replaced the guns with
   [321]walkie-talkies.^[322][7]

   At the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the
   score.^[323][67] The new release grossed $35 million domestically,
   bringing the film's total worldwide gross to $793 million since
   1982.^[324][2] The 20th anniversary version was released as part of a
   two-disc DVD set on December 9, 2002; it was also packaged in a
   collector's edition with the original version.^[325][68] The changes to
   the film, particularly the escape scene, were criticized as
   [326]political correctness. [327]Peter Travers of [328]Rolling Stone
   wondered, "Remember those guns the feds carried? Thanks to the miracle
   of digital, they're now brandishing walkie-talkies.... Is this what two
   decades have done to free speech?"^[329][69] Chris Hewitt of
   [330]Empire wrote, "The changes are surprisingly low-key [...] while
   ILM's CGI E.T. is used sparingly as a complement to Carlo Rambaldi's
   extraordinary puppet."^[331][70] [332]South Park parodied many of the
   changes in the 2002 episode "[333]Free Hat".^[334][71]

[[335]edit] Other portrayals

   A traffic sign depicting E.T.

   In July 1982, during the film's first theatrical run, Spielberg and
   Mathison wrote a treatment for a sequel to be titled E.T. II: Nocturnal
   Fears. It would have seen Elliott and his friends kidnapped by evil
   aliens and follow their attempts to contact E.T. for help. Spielberg
   decided against pursuing the sequel, feeling it "would do nothing but
   rob the original of its virginity".^[336][42]

   [337]Atari made a [338]video game based on the film. Released in 1982,
   it was widely considered to be [339]one of the worst video games ever.
   [340]William Kotzwinkleauthor of the film's [341]novelizationwrote a
   sequel, E.T.: The Book of the Green Planet, published in 1985. The
   novel concerns E.T.'s return to its planet, Brodo Asogi; its subsequent
   demotion and exile to its childhood "farm"; and its attempts to return
   to Earth by effectively breaking all the laws of Brodo Asogi.^[342][72]
   [343]E.T. Adventure, a theme park ride, debuted at [344]Universal
   Studios Florida in 1990. The $40 million attraction features the title
   character saying goodbye to visitors by name.^[345][14]

   In 1998, E.T. was licensed to appear in television [346]public service
   announcements produced by the [347]Progressive Corporation. The
   announcements featured E.T.'s voice reminding drivers to "buckle up"
   their safety belts. Traffic signs depicting a stylized E.T. wearing a
   safety belt were installed on selected roads around the United
   States.^[348][73] The following year, [349]British Telecommunications
   launched the "Stay in Touch" campaign, with E.T. as the star of various
   advertisements. The campaign's slogan was "B.T. has E.T.", with "E.T."
   also taken to mean "extra technology".^[350][74] At Spielberg's
   suggestion, [351]George Lucas included members of E.T.'s race as
   background characters in [352]Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace
   (1999).^[353][75]
