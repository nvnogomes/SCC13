   The Kingdom of the East Angles or Kingdom of East Anglia was one of the
   ancient [25]Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The kingdom was named after the
   homeland of the Angles, [26]Angeln in northern [27]Germany, and
   initially consisted of [28]Norfolk and [29]Suffolk, names which
   possibly arose during or after the Danish settling ("North folk
   [people]" and "South folk [people]"). Upon the marriage of the East
   Anglian princess [30]Etheldreda, the [31]Isle of Ely also became part
   of the kingdom. The boundaries of the region, however, are vague. The
   modern region of [32]East Anglia is named after it.

[[33]edit] History

   The Kingdom of the East Angles, formed about the year 520 by the
   merging of the North and the South Folk (Angles who had settled in the
   former lands of the [34]Iceni during the previous century) was one of
   the seven Anglo-Saxon [35]heptarchy kingdoms (as defined in the 12th
   century writings of [36]Henry of Huntingdon). For a brief period
   following a victory over the rival kingdom of [37]Northumbria around
   the year 616, East Anglia was the most powerful of the [38]Anglo-Saxon
   kingdoms of England, and its king [39]Raedwald was [40]Bretwalda
   (overlord of the Anglo-Saxons kingdoms). But this did not last: over
   the next forty years, East Anglia was defeated by the [41]Mercians
   twice, and it continued to weaken relative to the other kingdoms until
   in 794, [42]Offa of Mercia had its king [43]thelberht killed and took
   control of the kingdom himself.

   The independence of the East Anglians was restored by a successful
   rebellion against Mercia (825827), in course of which two Mercian kings
   were killed attempting to crush it. On [44]November 20, [45]870 the
   [46]Danes killed [47]King Edmund and took the kingdom, which they named
   East Anglia (see [48]Ivar the Boneless). The Saxons retook the area in
   920, only to lose it again in 10151017, when it was conquered by
   [49]Canute the Great and given as a [50]fiefdom to [51]Thorkell the
   Tall, who was made [52]Jarl of East Anglia in 1017.
