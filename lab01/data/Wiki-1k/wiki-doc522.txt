[[32]edit] Property description

   The Dupee Estate-Mary Baker Eddy Home property consists of an 8.3-acre
   (34,000 m^2) tract of land with a combination gate and carriage house
   located near the entrance from Beacon Street and the main house located
   to its southeast. There are also two smaller out buildings located
   southwest of the carriage house.

[[33]edit] Main house

   The architecture of the main house built in 1880-1881 has been
   described variously as "Ruskinian Gothic" or "Gothic, Stick/Eastlake."
   The architects were Peabody & Stearns. The estate was added to the
   National Register on September 4, 1986, under building number 86001790.

   The main house has 3 stories and a basement and has 25 rooms, 4
   chimneys and 17,180 square feet (1,596 m^2) of space. The exterior
   walls are of pudding stone, granite and blue stone blocks. The walls
   have long been covered by vines. The hip roof is black slate with red
   copper pans with multiple dormers and skylights.^[34][2]
     * A 10-room wing with elevator, designed by noted [35]Chicago-based
       architect, [36]Solon Spencer Beman was added to the main house in
       1907-1908 in preparation for Mary Baker Eddy's occupancy.

[[37]edit] Outbuildings

   The gate-carriage house, built in 1892, has 6,575 square feet (611 m^2)
   of space, while the garage has only 670 square feet (62 m^2).

[[38]edit] History

   [39]Mary Baker Eddy

[[40]edit] Prior to Eddy

   According to both [41]Mary Baker Eddy Library^[42][3] and National Park
   service sites^[43][1], the main house was built in 1880 by William
   Arthur Dupee, but this does not seem plausible since he was born on
   November 30, 1871. It seems more probable that it was built by his
   father, William Richardson Dupee, who was born [44]August 10, [45]1841,
   in [46]Brighton and died January 19, 1911, in [47]Brookline.

   In 1895 the estate was sold by the Dupee family to R. Ashton
   Lawrence..^[48][2]

[[49]edit] Eddy years

   Mary Baker Eddy bought the estate from R. Ashton Lawrence in October
   1907,^[50][2] but she did not move in until after the addition had been
   completed in 1908. She used the house not only as her home but also as
   the office from which she oversaw the management of the church she had
   founded. Mary Baker Eddy died at home on December 3, 1910, and was
   buried in [51]Mount Auburn Cemetery.

[[52]edit] After Eddy

   The estate at 400 Beacon Street was bequeathed by Mary Baker Eddy to
   her church which maintained it as she had left it. It was open to the
   public for many years until escalating costs as well as the need for
   major repairs and renovations led the church to close it to the public
   and to offer it for sale so that the proceeds could be better used to
   promote the church's mission.

   In December 2006, The [53]Longyear Museum, an organization dedicated to
   preservation of homes associated with Mary Baker Eddy, purchased her
   last home from the church for $13,301,027. The sale did not include the
   furnishings and artifacts that had been in the home since her death in
   1910. These were removed by the church before closing. In March, 2007,
   however, Longyear paid $156,000 to obtain some pieces of furniture,
   rugs, and five of the seven carriages from the estate. Longyear hopes
   to be able to buy more personal property from the church in the
   future.^[54][3]

   The house is now closed to the public so that Longyear can do the
   cleaning and restoration work necessary to bring it up to museum
   standards of quality.^[55][3]
