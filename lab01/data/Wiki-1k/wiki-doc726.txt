   Earthsearch: A Ten-Part Adventure Serial in Time and Space is a [8]BBC
   Radio 4 [9]science fiction series written by [10]James Follett,
   comprising ten half-hour episodes broadcast between January and March
   1981. There is also a [11]novelisation by Follett under the same title.
   The series has been released on [12]cassette and audio [13]CD, and has
   been [14]rerun several times on [15]BBC 7 beginning in 2003.

[[25]edit] Story

   Some years before the story opens, the huge Earth [26]starship
   Challenger, on a mission to find Earth-like [27]planets for
   [28]colonization, encountered a [29]meteoroid shower that killed all of
   the adult crew and seriously damaged the ship. The only human survivors
   were four babies - two boys, Telson and Darv, and two girls, Sharna and
   Astra.

   The four have been raised from childhood by androids and tutored by two
   disembodied voices called Angel One and Angel Two. Most of the humans
   believe the voices are real angels, but Darv is more suspicious and
   believes they are actually [30]computers.

   Darv is correct. The Angels are the Challenger's ancillary control
   computers. Due to a fault in their design they have become
   [31]megalomaniacal and want to return to Earth and rule it. It was they
   who deliberately manoeuvred the Challenger into the path of the
   meteoroids and shut off the ship's defences. Unfortunately for them,
   they underestimated the amount of damage that would result, not only to
   the ship but themselves. As a result they have lost an unknown amount
   of potentially vital information about the nature of space and time.

   They are also having difficulties with the human crew, despite
   retarding the onset of [32]puberty with drugs in order to keep them
   [33]sexually ignorant. Telson, now commander, and Sharna are compliant,
   but Darv is headstrong and independent and is beginning to win Astra
   over.

   When the Challenger arrives in Earth's solar system, the crew and the
   Angels are equally surprised to discover that the Earth has vanished,
   leaving the moon behind. The irony is that the Angels now need Darv's
   rebellious mind to try to figure out where Earth has gone, otherwise
   they will have no planet to rule.

   The rest of the series deals with the crew's attempts to solve the
   mystery, encountering various humans and computers, hostile and
   otherwise, on their travels, while attempting to throw off the Angels'
   control over them once and for all.

   In the final episode the crew leave the Challenger to settle on a new
   planet which they call Paradise.

   The story is continued in [34]Earthsearch II. The prequel [35]Mindwarp
   is set on the original Earth. While it has only a loose connection to
   the Earthsearch series, it sets the stage for it, and contains many
   familiar plot elements and character traits.

   The series is notable for not violating the known laws of [36]physics
   by introducing [37]faster than light travel. Instead the crew must
   enter [38]suspended animation while the ship is travelling. The crew's
   ignorance of the [39]time dilation effect caused by [40]relativity is a
   major plot point.

[[41]edit] Trivia

   Most of the regular cast had cameo roles (sometimes playing more than
   one character) in BBC Radio's 1981 production of [42]The Lord of the
   Rings, because the cast were all still members of the BBC Radio Drama
   Repertory Company at the time when the [43]Tolkien adaptation was being
   made.

   In the original broadcast, when Angel One and Angel Two are talking to
   each other Angel One's voice is heard on the left stereo channel only
   and Angel Two on the right (although due to the technical limitations
   of the recording some [44]crosstalk can be heard on the opposite
   channels). In the BBC 7 broadcast they are sometimes heard on the
   opposite channels, indicating that entire episodes are broadcast with
   the stereo channels transposed. Furthermore, listeners to BBC 7's
   [45]mono [46]DAB service complained that they could only hear one half
   of these conversations, indicating that the DAB transmission may have
   been sometime taken from one of the two stereo channels instead of
   being a mix of both.
