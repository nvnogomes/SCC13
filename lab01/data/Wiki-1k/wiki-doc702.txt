   Viscount Taaffe was created in the [13]Peerage of Ireland in [14]1628.
   The Viscount bears the subsidiary title of Baron of Ballymote
   ([15]1628). They are also Count of the [16]Holy Roman Empire.

   From the 13th century the Taaffes had been one of the leading families
   in Ireland. In [17]1628, [18]Sir John Taaffe was raised to the peerage
   as Baron of [19]Ballymote and Viscount Taaffe of Corren. He left
   fifteen children, of whom the eldest, [20]Theobald, took a prominent
   part in the [21]English Civil War and on the Restoration was created
   [22]Earl of Carlingford.

   Theobald was succeeded in the title by his second son [23]Nicholas, who
   had served in the Spanish wars and was killed at the [24]Battle of the
   Boyne.

   The next brother, [25]Francis, the third Earl, was one of the most
   celebrated men of his time: he was brought up at [26]Olmtz, at the
   imperial court, and in the service of Duke [27]Charles of Lorraine,
   whose most intimate friend he became. He rose to the [28]highest rank
   in the Austrian army, having greatly distinguished himself at the
   [29]Battle of Vienna and in the other Turkish campaigns, and was a
   member of the [30]Order of the Golden Fleece. He was sent on many
   important diplomatic missions, and at the end of his life was
   chancellor and chief minister to the duke of Lorraine.

   Notwithstanding the Jacobite connections of his family, Francis' title
   to the earldom of Carlingford was confirmed by [31]William III, and the
   attainder and forfeiture of the estates incurred by his brother was
   repealed. This favor he owed to his position at the court of the
   emperor, William's most important ally. On his death the title and
   estates went to his nephew [32]Theobald, whose father had fallen during
   the [33]Siege of Derry, and who himself had served with distinction in
   the Austrian army.

   On his death, the title of Earl of Carlingford became extinct; both the
   Austrian and Irish estates as well as the Irish viscountcy went to a
   cousin, [34]Nicholas (16771769). Like so many of his family, he was
   brought up in Lorraine and passed into the Austrian army; he fought in
   the [35]Silesian wars, rose to be Field Marshal, and was made a count
   of the Empire. His Irish estates were, however, claimed under the
   [36]Act of 1703 by a Protestant heir: a lawsuit followed, which was
   ended by a compromise embodied in a private act of parliament, by which
   the estates were sold and one-third of the value given to him. With the
   money he acquired the castle of [37]Ellischau, in Bohemia; he had also
   inherited other property in the Austrian dominions. He was naturalized
   in Bohemia, and left on record that the reason for this step was that
   he did not wish his descendants to be exposed to the temptation of
   becoming Protestants so as to avoid the operation of the [38]Penal
   Laws. A [39]Committee of Privileges of the [40]House of Lords in
   [41]1860 recognized the right of the family to hold the Irish title.

       in fact done so.
