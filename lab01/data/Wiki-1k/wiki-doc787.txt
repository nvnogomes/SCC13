Ebenezer Emmons

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Ebenezer Emmons (1799-1863), [8]American [9]geologist, was born at
   [10]Middlefield, Massachusetts, on the 16th of May 1799, son of
   Ebenezer and Mary (Mack) Emmons.^[11][1]

   He studied medicine at [12]Albany, and after taking his degree
   practised for some years in Berkshire county. His interest in
   [13]geology was kindled in early life, and in 1824 he had assisted Prof
   Chester Dewey (1784-1867) in preparing a [14]geological map of
   Berkshire county, in which the first attempt was made to classify the
   [15]rocks of the [16]Taconic area.^[17][2] He still longed to pursue
   his interest in geology, so decided to attend the Rensselaer School
   (now RPI). There, he was inspired by the eminent professor [18]Amos
   Eaton, and graduated from [19]Rensselaer in its first class in 1826.
   While thus giving much of his time to [20]natural science, undertaking
   professional work in natural history and geology in [21]Williams
   College, he also accepted the professorship of [22]chemistry and
   afterwards of [23]obstetrics at [24]Albany Medical College.

   The chief work of his life was, however, in geology, and he has been
   designated by [25]Jules Marcou as the founder of American
   [26]palaeozoic [27]stratigraphy, and the first discoverer of the
   primordial fauna in any country. In 1836 he became attached to the
   [28]Geological Survey of the State of New York, and after lengthened
   study he grouped the local [29]strata (1842) into the Taconic and
   overlying [30]New York systems. The latter system was subdivided into
   several groups that were by no means well defined. Emmons had
   previously described the Potsdam [31]sandstone (1838), and this was
   placed at the base of the New York system. It is now regarded as Upper
   [32]Cambrian.

   In 1844 Emmons for the first time obtained [33]fossils in his Taconic
   system: a notable discovery because the species obtained were found to
   differ from all then-known Palaeozoic fossils, and they were regarded
   as representing the primordial group. Marcou was thus led to advocate
   that the term Taconic be generally adopted in place of Cambrian.
   Nevertheless, the Taconic fauna of Emmons proved to include only the
   lower part of [34]Sedgwick's Cambrian.

   Emmons made contributions on [35]agriculture and geology to a series of
   volumes on the Natural History of New York (1848). He also issued a
   work entitled American Geology, containing a statement of the
   principles of the science with full illustrations of the characteristic
   American fossils (1855-1857). From 1851 to 1860 he was state geologist
   of [36]North Carolina. He died at [37]Brunswick, North Carolina, on the
   1st of October 1863.

   The overthrust in New York which places Lower Cambrian rocks in contact
   with Middle [38]Ordovician rocks is named for him, known as Emmons'
   line, formerly Logan's line. It is a segment that extends from
   [39]Canada through [40]Vermont, New York, and farther south. It
   traverses through the city of [41]Troy, New York and the
   [42]Poestenkill Falls and Gorge. He named the [43]Adirondack Mountains
   (1838) and [44]Taconic Mountains (1844) and acquainted the public with
   these regions.^[45][3]
