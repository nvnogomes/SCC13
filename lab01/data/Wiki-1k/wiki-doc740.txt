[[57]edit] History

[[58]edit] Opening

   East Croydon Station in 1990 before rebuilding.

   "Croydon" station was opened on 12 July 1841 by the [59]London &
   Brighton Railway (L&BR) with the inauguration of passenger services on
   what eventually became the present [60]Brighton Main Line from
   [61]Norwood as far as [62]Haywards Heath.^[63][4] The station was
   jointly administered by the L&BR (which became the [64]London, Brighton
   and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) in 1846) with the [65]South Eastern
   Railway (SER); fares to London from Croydon were common to the
   station's joint users.^[66][5] With the opening of the LBSCR's line to
   [67]London Victoria in 1860, extra platforms were provided which were
   treated by the LBSCR as forming part of a separate station named "New
   Croydon". The SER was excluded from this station which ran exclusively
   LBSCR services to London at fares cheaper than those which the SER
   could offer from the original station.^[68][6]

   In 1864, the LBSCR obtained authorisation to construct a -mile long
   branch line into the heart of the town centre near Katharine Street
   where [69]Croydon Central station was built. The new line opened in
   1868 but enjoyed little success and closed in 1871, only to reopen in
   1886 under pressure from the Town Council before finally closing in
   1890. The station was subsequently demolished and replaced by the new
   [70]Town Hall.^[71][7] In 1897-98, East Croydon and New Croydon
   stations were merged into a single station equipped with the three
   [72]island platforms which remain to this day. Even so, the two
   stations kept separate booking accounts until 1924.^[73][8]

[[74]edit] 1992 rebuilding

   The present East Croydon station building opened on 19 August 1992. It
   consists of a large steel and glass frame suspended from a lightweight
   steel structure that straddles the track and platforms to a much
   greater extent than was possible with its [75]Victorian predecessor.

   Four steel [76]ladder masts anchor the glass box and the whole gives
   the impression of a suspension bridge that stretches into the distance.
   External [77]canopies cover the entrances, a cafes open-air seating
   area and the approaches to the tram station. 440 m of glass were used
   in the roof and 800 m for the wall glazing. The architects were Alan
   Brookes Associates and the structural engineers YRM Anthony Hunt
   Associates.

[[78]edit] Services

[[79]edit] Destinations

   The station is well served, with frequent services on the London -
   [80]Gatwick Airport - [81]Brighton line, the [82]First Capital Connect
   route from Gatwick via [83]London Bridge and [84]St Pancras
   International to [85]Bedford, and the London Bridge - [86]Uckfield
   branch, recently overhauled with new [87]Class 171 DMUs. It is well
   provided with electronic information displays, showing next departures
   to some 80 named stations. All services, except Uckfield services, are
   provided by 750V DC third rail [88]EMUs. East Croydon serves
   destinations mainly in the [89]South of England. [90]East Sussex,
   [91]West Sussex, [92]Surrey and [93]Brighton & Hove are the counties
   which are usually served. Destinations include [94]Gatwick Airport,
   [95]Horsham, [96]Caterham, [97]Tattenham Corner, [98]Brighton,
   [99]Hastings, [100]Eastbourne, [101]Bognor Regis, [102]Portsmouth and
   [103]Tunbridge Wells, as well as many suburban stations in [104]South
   London and [105]Hertfordshire. It is one of the busiest commuter
   stations in Greater London.

   Trains from East Croydon also include [106]First Capital Connect
   services on the [107]Thameslink line. These services go to
   [108]Brighton, [109]Redhill, [110]Bedford, [111]Luton and [112]London
   Luton Airport which means that the station has direct services to two
   airports. They also serve stations in or near the [113]City of London,
   including [114]St Pancras International, [115]Farringdon, [116]City
   Thameslink and [117]London Blackfriars. [118]Charing Cross is served by
   a few trains from Reigate.

   Almost all passenger services from East Croydon are operated by
   [119]Southern. It operates local and suburban services on the
   [120]Brighton Main Line, express services to [121]London Victoria and
   [122]London Bridge, and local services in the South East region. These
   routes are collectively known as the South Central network.

[[123]edit] Former services

   Services from London Bridge to Tonbridge via Redhill were operated by
   [124]Southeastern until December 2008, when they were transferred to
   Southern.

   [125]CrossCountry services stopped at East Croydon on the route to
   Brighton - these services were withdrawn in December 2008.

[[126]edit] Up (northbound)

   Platforms 1 and 2 serve fast up (northbound) trains, to London Bridge,
   London Victoria and Bedford. Stopping services to London Bridge use
   platforms 4, as well as occasional fast trains towards the London
   terminus and 5 (both directions, normally used off-peak for trains
   terminating there). There are 43 train departures per hour going north
   off-peak during the week.

   Typical off-peak service in trains per hour, operated by [127]Southern:
     * 8 fast to [128]London Victoria (calling only at Clapham Junction)
     * 2 stopping to Victoria (via Thornton Heath)
     * 7 to [129]London Bridge:
          + 1 fast to London Bridge
          + 2 semi-fast to London Bridge (via Norwood Junction only)
          + 2 stopping (via Forest Hill)
          + 2 stopping (via Crystal Palace and Tulse Hill)
     * 2 to [130]Charing Cross
     * 1 to [131]Watford Junction

   Operated by [132]First Capital Connect:
     * 4 to [133]Bedford

[[134]edit] Down (southbound)

   Platform 3 (and sometimes platform 2 as well) is used for the fast down
   (southbound) services, to Brighton and the Sussex Coast. Stopping
   services use platform 5 (both directions, normally used off-peak for
   trains terminating there). Platform 6 is served by stopping services to
   Caterham and Tattenham Corner, and by services to Oxted, East Grinstead
   and Uckfield.

   There are 37 train departures per hour off-peak during the week.

   Operated by [135]Southern:

   Operated by [155]First Capital Connect:
     * 2 semi-fast to [156]Brighton (via Haywards Heath)
     * 2 stopping to [157]Brighton (via Three Bridges)

[[158]edit] Facilities

   Electronic information board and shops on the concourse of the station

   The main entrance to the station is from George Street, into the main
   concourse of the station.^[159][9] There are many shops here, such as
   [160]WHSmith, [161]Costa Coffee, [162]Burger King and [163]Upper Crust.
   Another entrance to the station is next to the taxi rank on Billinton
   Hill just off [164]Cherry Orchard Road, on the east side of the
   station.

   The ticket office usually becomes busy during peak hours as well as the
   ticket machines. A disabled-accessible slope to all platforms is
   provided and there is a subway connecting all platforms further along
   the station. There are three waiting rooms on the platforms under a
   roof with plenty of standard metal seats. There are refreshment stalls
   and vending machines in the seating areas on the platforms. Trolleys
   are also available along with step-free access to all
   buffets.^[165][10]

   East Croydon station is one of the few to provide comfortable leather
   sofas for passengers. These can be found in the waiting room on
   platforms 3 and 4. They are often used by passengers from [166]London
   Gatwick Airport between 2am-4am who change at East Croydon to access
   [167]Clapham Junction railway station but are required to wait for
   approximately 40 minutes for a connecting service from platform 4, if
   they miss the hourly direct service.

   There are 3 [168]cash machines/ATMs located opposite the west entrance.

[[169]edit] Future

[[170]edit] Station expansion

   As part of the [171]Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration scheme, East
   Croydon station is to be expanded both to the west and to the east.
   Work has been planned on the west side for some time, to increase
   station capacity - made more urgent by likely additional traffic from
   the planned [172]Croydon Gateway nearby. A proposal by Arrowcroft,
   which included a 12,500 seat arena, [173]Croydon Arena, was rejected in
   August 2008 [174](public inquiry website). Arrowcroft had proposed a 24
   million expansion of the station with a new 'airport style' concourse
   above the tracks to the north of the current station. Arrowcroft had
   agreed to contribute 500,000 to the build costs to offset the impact of
   their proposed Arena. The source of the remaining 23.5 million was not
   identified, and Network Rail had not committed this expenditure in its
   capital plans. The alternative scheme called [175]Ruskin Square, by the
   owners of the site Stanhope Schroders, includes a contribution of 1.1
   million for station capacity improvements that could be quickly
   implemented and integrated into their scheme for a new urban park, a
   rebuilt [176]Warehouse Theatre, a doctors' surgery, housing (50%
   "affordable") and modern offices on the Croydon Gateway site.

   To the east, towards [177]Cherry Orchard Road, the proposed towers
   would also result in an extension to the station. The architect would
   be Make with the client Menta, engineer Knight Frank and GL Hearn.
   Originally this project was planned to start in 2009, but this has been
   put back to 2019 with the planned completion date in 2023. The
   mixed-use scheme is to total approximately 93,000 sq m (1 million sq
   ft) of modern accommodation in a series of crystalline towers. Of the
   total area, some 70% is planned to be residential accommodation, with
   the remaining 30% being of mixed commercial use, including offices and
   retail. Critical to all proposals around East Croydon station are
   improvements to transport interchange. No project has yet delivered the
   necessary funds for significant enhancements.

[[178]edit] Oyster Card

   The Pay-as-you-go [179]Oyster Card cannot at present be used at the
   station, even though there are ticket barriers which could be
   upgraded.^[180][11] Southern and sister company Southeastern were
   criticized in January 2007 for not wishing to introduce Oyster Pay As
   You Go on their London routes, stating that it was not financially
   viable. Southern and other London train operators have now agreed to
   introduce Oyster following financial support being offered by [181]Ken
   Livingstone, the then [182]Mayor of London.

[[183]edit] Thameslink Programme

          Main article: [184]Thameslink 2000

   The [185]Thameslink Programme (formerly known as Thameslink 2000), is a
   3.5 billion major project to expand the [186]Thameslink network from 51
   to 172 [187]stations^[188][12] spreading northwards to [189]Bedford,
   [190]Peterborough, [191]Cambridge and [192]King's Lynn and southwards
   to [193]Guildford, [194]Eastbourne, [195]Horsham, [196]Hove to
   [197]Littlehampton, [198]East Grinstead, [199]Ashford and
   [200]Dartford. The project includes the lengthening of platforms,
   station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaduct) and
   additional rolling stock. When implemented, [201]First Capital Connect
   services would call more often at the station and other stations in the
   Croydon area, including Purley and Norwood Junction.

[[202]edit] Selhurst Depot

   There is a large depot for [203]Southern and [204]First Capital Connect
   trains, located just to the north of the station. Units serviced there
   include classes [205]171, [206]319, [207]377, and [208]455 plus
   numerous departmental units and Class 9 shunters. Selhurst Depot is the
   first train depot, going south, on the [209]Brighton Main Line
   [210]London Bridge branch; there is another depot, Balham Depot, on the
   Victoria Branch.

[[211]edit] Transport Connections

   The [212]Tramlink tram interchange outside the station

   East Croydon is well served by both tram and bus, with a tram station
   outside and a bus station close by. At the bus station there are a
   large number of [213]London Bus services that reach [214]Central
   London, [215]Purley Way, [216]Bromley, [217]Lewisham and a number of
   other [218]civic centres in the South. [219]London Buses route X26, the
   longest London bus route, provides services to [220]Heathrow Airport
   via [221]Richmond and Sutton.

   Immediately outside the front of the station is the [222]Tramlink stop,
   with services to [223]Elmers End, [224]Beckenham Junction, [225]New
   Addington and [226]Wimbledon, and a bus station. A major interchange on
   Tramlink, East Croydon has three tram platforms, two on an island, the
   other backing on to the main-line station concourse. Following problems
   with the points in this area, in August 2006 the points were fixed to
   route all eastbound trams into Platform 1, the concourse-side platform.
   Thus the island platform can only be used by westbound trams and by
   trams arriving from the east which terminate at East Croydon.

[[227]edit] Crime

   In January 2006 the [228]London Assembly issued statistics of crime in
   main-line railway stations outside Zone 1. East Croydon, [229]Clapham
   Junction and [230]Walthamstow Central were the worst in terms of total
   number of crimes. This statistic should be viewed in context however,
   since these are among the busiest overground stations outside Zone 1; a
   figure comparing crimes per 1000 passengers would be more
   meaningful.^[231][13]
