   A dump truck or production truck is a [11]truck used for transporting
   loose material (such as [12]sand, [13]gravel, or [14]dirt) for
   [15]construction. A typical dump truck is equipped with a
   [16]hydraulically operated open-box bed hinged at the rear, the front
   of which can be lifted up to allow the contents to be deposited on the
   ground behind the truck at the site of delivery. In the UK the term
   applies to off-road construction plant only, and the road vehicle is
   known as a tipper or tipper lorry.

[[37]edit] Types of dump trucks

   An [38]Ashok Leyland Comet dump truck, this is a good example of a very
   basic 2x4 dump truck used for payloads of 10 tonnes or less.

   The dump truck was first conceived in [39]Saint John, New Brunswick
   when Robert T. Mawhinney attached to a dump box to a flat bed truck in
   1920. The lifting device was a winch attached to a cable that fed over
   sheave ([40]pulley) mounted on a mast behind the cab. The cable was
   connected to the lower front end of the wooden dump box which was
   attached by a pivot at the back of the truck frame. The operator turned
   a crank to raise and lower the box.^[41][1]^[42][2] Today, virtually
   all dump trucks operate by [43]hydraulics and they come in a variety of
   configurations each designed to accomplish a specific task in the
   construction material supply chain.

[[44]edit] Standard dump truck

   Another kind of 8x4 dump truck: three rear (two powered) axles

   A standard dump truck is a [45]full truck [46]chassis with a dump body
   mounted to the [47]frame. The dump body is raised by a [48]hydraulic
   ram mounted forward of the front [49]bulkhead, between the [50]truck
   cab ([51]traction unit) and the dump body ([52]semi-trailer). The
   [53]tailgate can be configured to swing on hinges or it can be
   configured in the "High Lift Tailgate" format wherein [54]pneumatic
   rams lift the gate open and up above the dump body.

   A standard dump truck has one front [55]axle, and one or more rear
   axles which typically have dual wheels on each side. Common
   configurations for a standard dump truck include the six wheeler which
   has one rear axle, the ten wheeler with two rear axles, and the
   tri-axle with three rear axles. These are mainly found in inner cities
   and in the deep south of the US. The largest of the standard dump
   trucks is commonly called a "centipede" and has seven axles. The rear
   two axles are powered and the front axle is the steering axle. The
   intermediate axles are present to support the weigh over the length of
   the chassis and sometimes to provide additional braking power.

   The short [56]wheelbase of a standard dump truck makes it more
   maneuverable than the higher capacity [57]semi-trailer dump trucks.

[[58]edit] Articulated dump truck

   Articulated dump truck or dumper

   An articulated dump truck has a hinge between the cab and the dump box,
   but is distinct from semi trailer trucks in that the cab is a permanent
   fixture, not a separable vehicle. Steering is accomplished via
   hydraulic rams that pivot the entire cab, rather than [59]rack and
   pinion [60]steering on the front axle. This vehicle is highly adaptable
   to rough terrain. In line with its use in rough terrain longer
   distances and overly flat surfaces tend to cause driveline troubles,
   and failures. Articulated trucks are often referred to as the modern
   [61]scraper, in the sense that they carry a much higher [62]maintenance
   burden than most trucks. See the first mass produced articulated dump
   truck (articulated hauler):^[63][3]

[[64]edit] Transfer dump truck

   Example of a transfer truck and trailer

   A [65]transfer dump (colloquially referred to as a "Slam-Bang!" because
   of the noise made when transferring) is a standard dump truck which
   pulls a separate trailer which can also be loaded with [66]aggregate
   ([67]gravel, [68]sand, [69]asphalt, klinker, snow, wood chips, triple
   mix, etc.)

   The second aggregate container, ([70]B box) on the trailer, is powered
   by either an electric, pneumatic motor or hydraulic line,. It rolls on
   small wheels, riding on rails from the trailer's frame, into the empty
   main dump (A) box. This maximizes payload capacity without sacrificing
   the maneuverability of the standard dump truck. Transfer dumps are
   typically seen in the western United States because of the peculiar
   weight restrictions on western highways.

   Another configuration seen is called a Triple Transfer Train, which
   consists of a B and C box. These are common on Nevada and Utah Highways
   but not in California. Depending on the axle arrangement, a Triple
   Transfer can haul up to 129,000 with a special permit in certain US
   states. The Triple Transfer usually costs a contactor about $105 an
   hour while a A/B config usually runs about $85 per hour (2007 stats).

   Transfer dump trucks typically haul between 26 and 27 tons of aggregate
   per load, each truck is capable of 3-5 loads per day, generally
   speaking.

[[71]edit] Truck and pup

   A truck and pup is very similar to a transfer dump. It consists of a
   standard dump truck pulling a dump trailer. The pup trailer, unlike the
   transfer, has its own hydraulic ram and is capable of self-unloading.

[[72]edit] Superdump truck

   Example of a Superdump body and trailing axle

   A Superdump is a straight dump truck equipped with a trailing axle, a
   liftable, load-bearing axle rated as high as 13,000 pounds. Trailing 11
   to 13 feet behind the rear tandem, the trailing axle stretches the
   outer "bridge" measurementthe distance between the first and last
   axlesto the maximum overall length allowed. This increases the gross
   weight allowed under the federal bridge formula, which sets standards
   for truck size and weight. Depending on the vehicle length and axle
   configuration, Superdumps can be rated as high as 80,000 pounds GVW and
   carry 26 tons of payload or more. When the truck is empty or ready to
   offload, the trailing axle toggles up off the road surface on two
   hydraulic arms to clear the rear of the vehicle. Truck owners call
   their trailing axle-equipped trucks Superdumps because they far exceed
   the [73]payload, productivity, and return on investment of a
   conventional dump truck. The Superdump and trailing axle concept was
   developed by [74]Strong Industries of [75]Houston, [76]Texas.

[[77]edit] Semi trailer end dump truck

   End dump trailer.

   A semi end dump is a tractor-trailer combination wherein the trailer
   itself contains the hydraulic [78]hoist. A typical semi end dump has a
   3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle [79]semi-trailer. The key advantage of
   a semi end dump is rapid unloading. A key disadvantage is that they are
   very unstable when raised in the dumping position limiting their use in
   many applications where the dumping location is uneven or off level.

[[80]edit] Semi trailer bottom dump truck

   Bottom dump trailer.

   A semi bottom dump (or "belly dump") is a 3-axle tractor pulling a
   2-axle trailer with a [81]clam shell type [82]dump gate in the belly of
   the trailer. The key advantage of a semi bottom dump is its ability to
   lay material in a [83]wind row (a linear heap). In addition, a semi
   bottom dump is maneuverable in reverse, unlike the double and triple
   trailer configurations described below. These trailers may be found
   either of the windrow type shown in the photo, or may be of the 'cross
   spread' type with the gates opening front to rear instead of left and
   right. The cross spread gates will actually spread gravel fairly evenly
   the width of the trailer. by comparison, the windrow gates leave a pile
   in the middle. The cross spreads jam and do not work well with larger
   materials. Likewise they are not suitable for use where spreading is
   not desired such as when hot asphalt paving material is being dumped in
   front of a paving machine.

[[84]edit] Double and triple trailer bottom dump truck

   Double and triple bottom dumps consist of a 2-axle tractor pulling one
   single-axle semi-trailer and an additional full trailer (or two full
   trailers in the case of triples). These dump trucks allow the driver to
   lay material in windrows without leaving the cab or stopping the truck.
   The main disadvantage is the difficulty in backing double and triple
   units.

   The specific type of dump truck used in any specific country is likely
   to be closely keyed to the weight and axle limitations of that
   jurisdiction. Rock, dirt and other types of materials commonly hauled
   in trucks of this type are quite heavy, and almost any style of truck
   can be easily overloaded. Because of this, this type of truck is
   frequently configured to take advantage of local weight limitations to
   maximize the cargo. For example, within the [85]United States, the
   maximum weight limit of 40 tons throughout the country, except for
   specific bridges with lower limits. Individual states, in some
   instances, are allowed to authorize trucks up to 52.5 tons. Most states
   that do so require that the trucks be very long, to spread the weight
   over more distance. It is in this context that double and triple
   bottoms are found within the US.

[[86]edit] Side dump truck

   Side Dump Industries Train Set.

   A side dump truck consists of a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle
   semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams which tilt the dump body onto its
   side, spilling the material to either the left or right side of the
   trailer. The key advantages of the side dump are that it allows rapid
   unloading and can carry more weight in western United States. In
   addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping
   unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is,
   however, highly likely that a side dump trailer will tip over if
   dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping lose materials or
   cobble sized stone, the side dump can become stuck if the pile becomes
   wide enough to cover too much of the trailer's wheels. Trailers that
   dump at the appropriate angle (50 for example) avoid the problem of the
   dumped load fouling the path of the trailer wheels by dumping their
   loads further to the side of the truck, in some cases leaving
   sufficient clearance to walk between the dumped load and the trailer.

[[87]edit] Off-road dump truck

   [88]Liebherr T 282B mining truck.
   Hitachi mining truck.

   Off-road dump trucks more closely resemble heavy construction equipment
   or [89]engineering vehicles than they do highway dump trucks. They are
   used strictly off-road for mining and heavy dirt hauling jobs.

   The term Dump Truck is not generally used by the mining industry, or by
   the manufacturers that build these machines. The more appropriate US
   term for this strictly off road vehicle is, Haul truck and the
   equivalent European term is 'Dumper'. The classification bottom and
   side for example, describes how the loaded material is discharged once
   loaded. In the case of the [90]Haul truck illustrated, a [91]Liebherr
   [92]T 282B the load is discharged to the rear, designating this
   particular vehicle as an end dump.

   Bottom dump normally describes a trailer that discharges its load by
   opening two [93]clam shell [94]doors under the load space, in some
   examples several trailers ([95]road train) are pulled by one truck
   mainly these are on road machines. The only remaining example of what
   is described as a unitized bottom dump coal hauler is manufactured by
   Kress Corporation. This large capacity truck is used for the
   transportation of coal from a loading device ([96]shovel) directly to a
   power station or bulk storage area.

   The current largest off road haul trucks are the Liebherr T282B and the
   [97]Caterpillar 797B, which both have payloads of 400 short tons. Even
   though these trucks are similar in capacity the Caterpillar is referred
   to as a mechanical truck since it uses a big diesel engine(s, sometimes
   two) and big transmissions to power the rear wheels. The Liebherr is
   referred to as a [98]Diesel-Electric Truck since it uses a diesel
   engine linked to an alternator that generates electricity which is
   converted to AC used to power two giant electric motors found on the
   rear wheel assemblies, similar to a locomotive (it is a series
   [99]plug-in hybrid). Besides Liebherr and Caterpillar, Hitachi, Terex,
   Komatsu and others also fabricate such off road haul trucks in
   different capacities.

[[100]edit] Winter service vehicles

   Many [101]winter service vehicle units are based on dump trucks, to
   allow the placement of [102]ballast to weigh the truck down or to hold
   [103]sodium or [104]calcium chloride [105]salts for spreading on snow
   and ice covered surfaces.

[[106]edit] Dangers

   Dump trucks are normally built for some amount of off-road or
   construction site driving; as the driver is protected by the
   [107]chassis and height of the driver's seat, [108]bumpers are either
   placed high or omitted for added ground clearance. The disadvantage is
   that in a collision with a standard car, the entire motor section or
   luggage compartment goes under the truck. Thus, passengers in the car
   could be more severely injured than would be common in a collision with
   another car. Several countries have made rules that new trucks should
   have bumpers approximately 40 cm (20 in) above ground in order to
   protect other drivers better. There are also rules about how long the
   load or construction of the truck can go beyond the rear bumper to
   prevent cars that rear-end the truck from going under it.^[109][4]

   Another safety consideration is the leveling of the truck before
   unloading. If the truck is not parked on a relatively horizontal
   ground, the sudden change of weight and balance due to lifting of the
   skip and dumping of the material can cause the truck to slide, or even
   - in some light dump trucks - to turn over.

[[110]edit] Education

   The [111]National Association of Heavy Equipment Training Schools
   (NAHETS), established 2002, uses dumptruck training and schools
   curriculum as a method to test and train users in the ability of dump
   truck use.
