   Donald Olding Hebb ([92]July 22, [93]1904 [94]August 20, [95]1985) was
   a Canadian [96]psychologist who was influential in the area of
   [97]neuropsychology, where he sought to understand how the function of
   [98]neurons contributed to psychological processes such as
   [99]learning. He has been described as the father of neuropsychology
   and neural networks.

[[107]edit] Life

   Donald Hebb was born in [108]Chester, [109]Nova Scotia, the oldest of
   four children of Arthur M. and M. Clara (Olding) Hebb, and lived there
   until the age of 16, when his parents moved to [110]Dartmouth, Nova
   Scotia.

   Donald's parents were both physicians. Donald's mother was heavily
   influenced by the ideas of [111]Maria Montessori, and she home schooled
   him until the age of 8. He performed so well in elementary school that
   he was promoted to the 7th grade at 10 years of age. Although his
   rebellious attitude and disrespect for authority may have contributed
   to his failing the 11th grade, he graduated from the 12th grade two
   years later. (At that time in Chester, the 9th, 10th and 11th grades
   were taught in the same classroom by the same teacher. The year Donald
   failed the 11th grade, most (almost all?) of the students in the three
   grades failed the provincial exams and hence their year. Those failing
   the 9th and 10th years were moved to the next grade despite their
   failures. There was no 12th grade in Chester for Donald to be moved to
   and so he repeated the 11th grade. The following year, then living in
   Dartmouth, he successfully completed the 12th grade at Halifax County
   Academy in Halifax.)

   The older of Donald's younger brothers, Andrew, obtained a law degree
   but went on to a career in journalism and then insurance. Donald's
   youngest brother, Peter, became a physician like his parents. And his
   sister, Catherine, eventually became a prominent physiologist. But
   Donald, early in life, had no aspirations toward psychology or the
   medical field; rather, he wanted to be a writer. He entered
   [112]Dalhousie University aiming to become a novelist. He wasn't an
   exceptional student (his best subjects were math and science) but he
   graduated with a [113]Bachelor of Arts degree in 1925. Afterward, he
   became a teacher, teaching at his old school in Chester. Later, he
   became a farmer in [114]Alberta and then traveled around, working as a
   laborer in [115]Quebec. During his travels he encountered the works of
   [116]Sigmund Freud (which he regarded as "not too rigorous"),
   [117]William James, and [118]John B. Watson which made him consider
   joining the field of psychology.

   At the age of 23, he decided to enter the field of psychology. He asked
   [119]William Dunlop Tait, the chairman of the pychology department at
   [120]McGill University (a post Hebb would one day hold) what he'd have
   to do to get in and was given a reading list and told to come back in a
   year's time. During this year of study, he went back to teaching.

   In 1928, he became a part-time graduate student at McGill University.
   But, at the same time, he was appointed headmaster of a troubled school
   in the suburbs of [121]Montreal. He worked with two colleagues from the
   university, Kellogg and Clarke, to improve the situation. He took a
   more innovative approach to educationfor example, assigning more
   interesting schoolwork and sending anyone misbehaving outside (making
   schoolwork a privilege).

   In 1931, Hebb became bedridden because of [122]tuberculosis in his hip.
   He used the time to read [123]Charles Scott Sherrington's [124]The
   Integrative Action of the Nervous System and [125]Ivan Pavlov's
   [126]Conditioned Reflexes. His master's thesis, written later that
   year, titled Conditioned and Unconditioned Reflexes and Inhibition,
   tried to show that skeletal reflexes were due to cellular learning.
   This he later dismissed as "nonsense, but no immediate disproof was
   available at the time." And yet, one of the men who later approved the
   thesis, [127]Boris Babkin, had worked with Pavlov himself. At the very
   least, the thesis demonstrated the start of a thought process that
   would later lead to the [128]Hebb synapse. Hebb passed [129]cum laude.
   Babkin arranged for Hebb to do research on conditioning with
   [130]Leonid Andreyev, another former member of Pavlov's laboratory.

   Between 1933 and 1934, Hebb wrote a booklet titled Scientific Method in
   Psychology: A Theory of Epistemology Based on Objective Psychology. It
   was never published, but it contained many ideas that would become part
   of his later work.

   By the beginning of 1934, Hebb's life was in a slump. His wife had
   died, following a car accident, on his twenty-ninth birthday (July 22,
   1933). His work at the Montreal school was going badly. In his words,
   it was "defeated by the rigidity of the curriculum in Quebec's
   protestant schools." The focus of study at McGill was more in the
   direction of education and intelligence, and Hebb was now more
   interested in physiological psychology and was critical of the
   methodology of the experiments there.

   He decided to leave Montreal and wrote to Robert Yerkes at Yale where
   he was offered a position to study for a [131]PhD. Babkin, however,
   convinced Hebb to go study with [132]Karl Lashley instead.

   In July 1934, Hebb was accepted to study under Karl Lashley at the
   [133]University of Chicago. His thesis was titled "The problem of
   spatial orientation and place learning". Hebb, along with two other
   students, followed Lashley to [134]Harvard University in September,
   1935. Here, he had to change his thesis. At Harvard, he did his thesis
   research on the effects of early visual deprivation upon size and
   brightness perception in a rat. That is, he raised rats in the dark and
   some in the light and compared their brains. In 1936, he got his PhD
   from Harvard.

   The next year he worked as a research assistant to Lashley and as a
   teaching assistant in introductory psychology for [135]Edwin G. Boring
   at [136]Radcliffe College. His Harvard thesis was soon published, and
   he finished the thesis he started at University of Chicago.

   In 1937, Hebb married his second wife, Elizabeth Nichols Donovan. That
   same year, on a tip from his sister Catherine (herself a PhD student
   with Babkin at McGill University), he applied to work with [137]Wilder
   Penfield at the [138]Montreal Neurological Institute. Here he
   researched the effect of brain surgery and injury on human brain
   function. He saw that the brain of a child could regain partial or full
   function when a portion of it is removed but that similar damage in an
   adult could be far more damaging, even catastrophic. From this, he
   deduced the prominent role that external stimulation played in the
   thought processes of adults. In fact, the lack of this stimulation, he
   showed, caused diminished function and sometimes [139]hallucinations.

   He also became critical of the [140]Stanford-Binet and [141]Wechsler
   intelligence tests for use with brain surgery patients. These tests
   were designed to measure overall intelligence, whereas Hebb believed
   tests should be designed to measure more specific effects that surgery
   could have had on the patient. Together with N.W. Morton, he created
   the [142]Adult Comprehension Test and the [143]Picture Anomaly Test.

   Putting the Picture Anomaly Test to use, he provided the first
   indication that the right temporal lobe was involved in visual
   recognition. He also showed that removal of large parts of the frontal
   lobe had little effect on intelligence. In fact, in one adult patient,
   who had a large portion of his frontal lobes removed in order to treat
   his [144]epilepsy, he noted "a striking post-operative improvement in
   personality and intellectual capacity." From these sorts of results, he
   started to believe that the frontal lobes were instrumental in learning
   only early in life.

   In 1939, he was appointed to a teaching position at [145]Queen's
   University. In order to test his theory of the changing role of the
   frontal lobes with age, he designed a variable path maze for rats with
   [146]Kenneth Williams called the [147]Hebb-Williams maze, a method for
   testing animal intelligence later used in countless studies. He used
   the maze to test the intelligence of rats blinded at different
   developmental stages, showing that "there is a lasting effect of infant
   experience on the problem-solving ability of the adult rat." This
   became one of the main principles of [148]developmental psychology,
   later helping those arguing the importance of the proposed [149]Head
   Start programs for preschool children in economically poor
   neighborhoods.

   In 1942, he moved to [150]Orange Park, Florida to once again work with
   Karl Lashley who had replaced Yerkes as the Director of the Yerkes
   Laboratories of Primate Biology at the [151]Yerkes National Primate
   Research Center. Here, studying primate behavior, Hebb developed
   emotional tests for [152]chimpanzees. The experiments were somewhat
   unsuccessful, however because chimpanzees turned out to be hard to
   teach. During the course of the work there, Hebb wrote [153]The
   Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory, his
   ground-breaking book that set forth the theory that the only way to
   explain behavior was in terms of brain function.

   Afterward, he returned to [154]McGill University to become a professor
   of psychology in 1947 and was made chairman of the department in 1948.
   Here he once again worked with Penfield, but this time through his
   students, which included [155]Mortimer Mishkin, [156]Haldor Enger
   Rosvold, and [157]Brenda Milner, all of whom extended his earlier work
   with Penfield on the human brain.

   His wife Elizabeth died in 1962. In 1966, Hebb married his third wife,
   Margaret Doreen Wright (ne Williamson), a widow.

   Hebb remained at McGill until retirement in 1972. He remained at McGill
   after retirement for a few years, in the Department of Psychology as an
   emeritus professor, conducting a seminar course required of all
   department graduate students. Afterward, in 1980, he returned to
   Dalhousie University as [158]professor emeritus of psychology.

   Hebb was a member of the [159]American Psychological Association (APA)
   and was its president in 1960. He won the APA Distinguished Scientific
   Contribution Award in 1961.

   Donald Hebb died in 1985, two years after his wife, in Nova Scotia. He
   was survived by two daughters (both by his second marriage), Mary Ellen
   Hebb and Jane Hebb Paul.

   The [160]Donald O. Hebb Award, named in his honor, is awarded to
   distinguished Canadian scientists.

[[161]edit] Work

[[162]edit] The Organization of Behavior (1949)

   "The Organization of Behavior" is considered Hebb's most important
   book. A combination of his years of work in brain surgery mixed with
   his study of human behavior, it finally brought together the two realms
   of human perception that for a long time could not be connected
   properly. That is, it connected the biological function of the brain as
   an organ together with the higher function of the mind.

   There were many theories on how the brain and the mind were connected.
   Pavlovian theories, for example, were based on a theory of stimulus and
   response, based on the belief that a path existed from sensory organs
   to the mind, which then made a response. The problem with the theory
   was that it was assumed that signals travel one way to the brain. It
   could not explain all the extra processing that adds to the input
   signals of human senses. Perhaps this was based on the fact that
   neurons themselves transmit in only one direction, but connections
   between various neurons are not necessarily one-way.

   In 1929, [163]Hans Berger discovered that the mind exhibits continuous
   electrical activity and cast doubt on the Pavlovian model of perception
   and response because, now, there appeared to be something going on in
   the brain even without much stimulus.

   At the same time, there were many mysteries. For example, if there was
   a method for the brain to recognize a circle, how does it recognize
   circles of various sizes or imperfect roundness? To accommodate every
   single possible circle that could exist, the brain would need a far
   greater capacity than it has.

   Another theory, the [164]Gestalt theory, stated that signals to the
   brain established a sort of field. The form of this field depended only
   on the pattern of the inputs, but it still could not explain how this
   field was understood by the mind.

   The behaviorist theories at the time did well at explaining how the
   processing of patterns happened. However, they could not account for
   how these patterns made it into the mind.

   Hebb combined up-to-date data about behavior and the mind into a single
   theory. And, while the understanding of the anatomy of the brain did
   not advance much since the development of the older theories on the
   operation of the brain, he was still able to piece together a theory
   that got a lot of the important functions of the brain right.

   His theory became known as [165]Hebbian theory and the models which
   follow this theory are said to exhibit [166]Hebbian learning. This
   method of learning is best expressed by this quote from the book:

          When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B and
          repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth
          process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells
          such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is
          increased

   This is often paraphrased as "Neurons that fire together wire
   together." It is commonly referred to as Hebb's Law.

   The combination of neurons which could be grouped together as one
   processing unit, Hebb referred to as "cell-assemblies". And their
   combination of connections made up the ever-changing algorithm which
   dictated the brain's response to stimuli.

   Not only did Hebb's model for the working of the mind influence how
   psychologists understood the processing of stimuli within the mind but
   also it opened up the way for the creation of computational machines
   that mimicked the biological processes of a living nervous system. And
   while the dominant form of synaptic transmission in the nervous system
   was later found to be chemical, modern [167]artificial neural networks
   are still based on the transmission of signals via electrical impulses
   that Hebbian theory was first designed around.

[[168]edit] Hebb as an educator

   Throughout his life Hebb enjoyed teaching and was very successful as a
   teacher. Both in his early years as a teacher and a headmaster in a
   Montreal school and in his later years at McGill University, he proved
   to be a very effective educator and a great influence on the scientific
   minds which were then his students.

   As a professor at McGill, he believed that one could not teach
   motivation, but rather create the conditions necessary for students
   under which to do their study and research. One could train them to
   write, help them choose a problem to study, and even help keep them
   from being distracted, but the motivation and passion for research and
   study had to come from the students themselves. He believed that
   students should be evaluated on their ability to think and create
   rather than their ability to memorize and reprocess older ideas.

   Hebb believed in a very objective study of the human mind, more as a
   study of a biological science. This attitude toward psychology and the
   way it is taught made McGill University a prominent center of
   psychological study.

   Hebb also came up with the [169]A/S ratio, a value that measures the
   brain complexity of an organism.

[[170]edit] Sensory deprivation, military research, and torture

   Hebb's name has often been invoked in discussions of the involvement of
   psychological researchers in interrogation techniques, including the
   use of sensory deprivation, because of his research into this field.
   Speaking at a Harvard symposium on sensory deprivation in June, 1958,
   Dr.Hebb is quoted as remarking:

     The work that we have done at McGill University began, actually,
     with the problem of brainwashing. We were not permitted to say so in
     the first publishing.... The chief impetus, of course, was the
     dismay at the kind of confessions being produced at the Russian
     Communist trials. Brainwashing was a term that came a little later,
     applied to Chinese procedures. We did not know what the Russian
     procedures were, but it seemed that they were producing some
     peculiar changes of attitude. How? One possible factor was
     perceptual isolation and we concentrated on that. ^[171][2]

   Recent research has argued that Dr. Hebb's sensory deprivation research
   was funded by and coordinated with the CIA (McCoy, 2007). Some of this
   research was done in secret, and the results were initially shared only
   with U.S. authorities. Some of this research involved human subjects
   that were put through hours of sensory deprivation treatments that by
   today's standards would be considered torture^[[172]citation needed].
