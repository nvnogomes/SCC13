[[21]edit] Origin of Andrabi

   Andrabi is the [22]surname of a [23]Sayyid [24]muslim dynasty in
   [25]Kashmir. Most of the dynasty's members live at [26]Ratnipora in the
   [27]Pulwama District,Malaratta area of [28]Srinagar and Kanthapora,
   [29]Lolab valley in the [30]Kupwara district. The ancestors of these
   people came from a place in Afghanistan called [31]Andarab [32][1],
   meaning "surrounded by water" -- a reference to the river of the same
   name winding through the valley named Andarab.

[[33]edit] Background

   Asiya Andrabi was born in 1963 in [34]Srinagar, [35]India. A daughter
   of a [36]physician, she wanted to become a scientist. After graduating
   in [37]Biology, she decided to dedicate herself as a full-time
   house-wife. During her time at home, she started reading Islamic books
   and came in contact with few others leaders of her time in and outside
   Kashmir, which influenced her to join Sho'ba-e-Khawateen (female
   section) of Jamaat-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir as an active member.

[[38]edit] Dukhtaran-e-Millat

   In 1981, after differences over several issues with the Jamaat-e-Islami
   leadership, Andrabi decided to form a female only exclusive
   [39]Islamist organisation called the [40]Dukhtaran-e-Millat. This
   organisation first started as an Islamic awareness organisation for
   women. Later on, it started to stage demonstrations in 1987, and turned
   to extreme violence. Drawing inspiration from some of the most violent
   theocratic groups in Islamic theocracies, it resorted to symbolic
   protests by defacing posters and hoardings depicting normally clad
   women, deeming them obscene. Presently its campaign took a violent turn
   with Andrabi and her cadres attacking unveiled women in a manner that
   is eerily similar to that of the notorious [41]Authority for the
   Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice of [42]Saudi Arabia.

   In 1990, when the terrorism started rolling in the [43]Kashmir Valley,
   the organisation was banned and went underground. In the early 1990's,
   she married a member of Kashmiri theocratic terrorist group, Hizbul
   Mujahideen, named Mohammed Qasim Faktu and subsequently had two sons,
   one of them named Muhammad bin Qasim.

[[44]edit] Activities

   Her organisation is rumoured to number around a couple of hundred
   members to a thousand. Andrabi formed Dukhtaran-e-Millat to radicalise
   women and recruit them into a terrorist movement that had by now become
   a front for groups seeking to impose an Islamic theocracy in Muslim
   majority areas in several parts of the world. She staged a rally in
   March 1987 against what she dubbed to be obscene films, a term she used
   for any mainstream Indian movie. [45]Dukhtaran-e-Millat cadres carried
   brushes and cans of paint under their [46]burqas and painted movie
   posters.

   Asiya Andrabi has been arrested and sent to prison on many occasions.
   The last occasion happened in 2004 and has been placed under
   house-arrest several times ever since. In an expression of extreme
   intolerance she proposed shuttering liquor shops, cyber cafes and
   restaurants offering seating arrangements for couples making the wild
   claim that these establishments had become dens of vice.

   In 2006, she initiated an anti-prostitution campaign which later led to
   uncovering of a high-profile scandal involving many of the top-post
   government officials. However when subsequent investigations uncovered
   the involvement of a few well-known terrorists and Islamic
   fundamentalist leaders as well, Andrabi quickly wound down her
   campaign.

   Andrabi is given to making provocative statements that in other
   contexts would be deemed misogynistic, intolerant, and even hate
   speech. She is also in the manner of [47]Wahabi Islamic fundamentalists
   everywhere given to absurd claims such as being an Arab, and expressing
   bizarre sentiments such as acceptance of polygamy.

[[48]edit] Quotations

   I don't believe in [49]Kashmiriyat, I don't believe in nationalism. I
   believe there are two nations - Muslims and non-Muslims[50][2]

   I'm Andrabi, I'm from the Syed dynasty. I'm not actually Kashmiri, I'm
   Arab, my ancestors had come from Arabia to Central Asia.[51][3]

   I do not call myself a Pakistani but a Muslim[52][4]

   I would be more than glad to share my house with other wives of Qasim
   (her husband)[53][5]

   Women look after the kitchen and men are supposed to work[54][6]
