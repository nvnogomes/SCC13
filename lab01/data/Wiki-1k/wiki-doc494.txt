   The Dumaru was a Hough-type wooden steam ship launched on [12]April 17,
   [13]1918, in [14]Portland, Oregon, as part of the [15]United States
   Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation. On [16]October 16, [17]1918,
   during her [18]maiden voyage, the Dumaru was struck by lightning off
   the coast of [19]Guam, igniting her munitions cargo and destroying the
   ship.

   All hands were able to evacuate into two lifeboats and one raft prior
   to the Dumaru's destruction, with the raft and its five passengers,
   including Captain Ole Berrensen, being rescued nine days later near the
   site of the wreck. The two lifeboats, one under-manned with only 9 of
   its 20 seats filled and the other severely overcrowded with 32 crewmen
   aboard, drifted for approximately 3 weeks across the [20]Pacific Ocean
   to the [21]Philippine Islands. The latter boat quickly exhausted its
   fresh water supply, forcing the crew to construct a crude
   [22]desalination device and eventually resort to [23]cannibalism,
   consuming the bodies of other crewmen who had died of exposure.
