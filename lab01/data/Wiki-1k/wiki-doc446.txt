   Duan Qirui.

   Duan Qirui (; [13]Wade-Giles Tuan Ch'i-jui; [14]pinyin: Dun Qru) (1864
   [15]November 2, [16]1936) was a [17]Chinese [18]warlord and politician,
   commander in the [19]Beiyang Army, and the [20]Provisional Chief
   Executive of Republic of China (in [21]Beijing) from [22]November 24,
   [23]1924 to [24]April 20, [25]1926. He was arguably the most powerful
   man in China from 1916 to 1920.

[[31]edit] Early life

   Born in [32]Hefei as Duan Qirui (), his [33]courtesy name was Zhiquan
   (). His grandfather was Duan Pei (), an officer in [34]Li Hongzhang's
   privately raised army called Huai Army (Huai Jun, ). Duan Qirui's
   father died early and Duan Qirui was raised by his maternal
   grandmother.

[[35]edit] Career

[[36]edit] Military

   In 1885, Duan Qirui entered Tianjin military academy () specializing in
   artillery, and graduated in 1889. After graduation, he was sent to
   [37]Lushun to oversee the construction of artillery fortifications, and
   soon, [38]Li Hongzhang sent him to study [39]military science in
   [40]Germany, and after returning to China, he was first named as a
   commissioner of Beiyang Armory () and then as an instructor of
   [41]Weihai military academy. In early 1896, [42]Yuan Shikai named Duan
   Qirui as the artillery commander of his new army and inspector general
   of training, so Duan had become one of Yuan Shikai's top lieutenants.

[[43]edit] Politics

   Duan later opposed Yuan's bid for [44]monarchy - he expected to succeed
   Yuan in the presidency, but the imperial gambit was seen as a betrayal.
   Duan tried to play the intermediary between the [45]rebels and Yuan,
   just as Yuan had done during the [46]Xinhai Revolution. Their
   friendship never repaired even after he was given the [47]premiership,
   because Yuan shrewdly stripped that office of its powers. He served as
   premier intermittently from 1912 to 1918 under several governments as
   part of shaky coalitions that often collapsed. Duan formed the
   [48]Anhui clique when the Beiyang army fractured after Yuan's death,
   and was the strongest supporter of China's entry into [49]World War I,
   but was unwilling to send any of his own troops abroad since it would
   weaken him against his rivals.

   After being fired by President [50]Li Yuanhong for obtaining secret
   [51]Japanese loans in 1917, he regained his office by toppling
   [52]Zhang Xun's [53]Qing restoration attempt of [54]Puyi. He was also
   engaged in a power struggle against his archrival, President [55]Feng
   Guozhang, over the war with [56]Sun Yat-sen's rival government. Duan
   wanted a military solution while the president advocated negotiating.
   He is most noticeable for his frequent collaboration with the Japanese
   in return for military and financial aid. His promise of giving Japan
   German [57]concessions in [58]Shandong was one of the reasons for the
   [59]May Fourth Movement in Beijing. He was held responsible for
   granting Japan its [60]21 demands in 1915, one of which was the
   [61]Shandong issue. With his popularity gone, other [62]warlords led by
   [63]Cao Kun sided against him and on [64]July 14, [65]1920, Duan's
   troop clashed with troops of [66]Zhili clique. After a merely four
   days, Duan suffered a decisive defeat and he was forced to retire. Duan
   fled to Japanese settlement in Tianjin and became an apartment
   landlord. While out of power, his Anhui clique allies were rapidly
   losing ground. In 1923, he joined the chorus against Cao Kun's
   assumption of the presidency. [67]Zhejiang, the last Anhui held
   province, fell in the summer of 1924.

   1924

   He was called out of retirement in November 1924 after the [68]Beijing
   coup and put in charge of a provisional government after an agreement
   with [69]Zhang Zuolin and [70]Feng Yuxiang. Duan, Zhang, and Feng were
   negotiating with Sun Yat-sen on national reunification until the latter
   succumbed to [71]cancer in 1925. With his clique's military power in
   shambles, his government was hopelessly dependent on Feng and Zhang.
   Knowing that those two had poor relations, he tried to play sides
   secretly. On [72]March 18, [73]1926 he ordered his troops to gun down
   protesters, killing dozens in what became known as the [74]March 18
   Massacre. The next month, Feng deposed Duan who then fled into Zhang's
   hands. Zhang, tired of his double-dealings, refused to restore Duan
   after capturing Beijing. Most of the Anhui clique had already sided
   with Zhang. He fled to [75]Tianjin and later moved to [76]Shanghai
   where he died.

[[77]edit] Go, Buddhism and vegetarianism

   Duan was also well known as a player and patron of [78]weiqi (Go). He
   usually won because his opponents feared defeating him, with an
   exception of his own son, who was also a patron of weiqi and was not
   afraid of defeating his own father. After Duan's complete defeat, he
   became a devoted Buddhist, built a worship hall within his own home,
   and prayed every morning. Many of his former subordinates frequently
   came to pray with him. On the first and the fifteenth days of each
   month (lunar calendar), Duan would go to temples to participate in
   various Buddhist events. Duan became a vegetarian; [79]douchi was his
   favorite food and was served at every meal. Duan also kept a hen farm
   at home to provide him with eggs, but kept no roosters, as he claimed
   that without fertilization, the eggs remained vegetarian.
