[[15]edit] Creation

   After the death of his younger brother [16]Emil in an 1864
   nitroglycerin explosion at the family's armaments factory in
   Heleneborg, [17]Stockholm, Nobel founded Nitroglycerin AB in
   Winterviken near Stockholm. A year later, having found some German
   business partners, he launched the Alfred Nobel & Company in Germany,
   building an isolated factory in the Krmmel hills of [18]Geesthacht near
   Hamburg. This business exported a liquid combination of nitroglycerin
   and [19]gunpowder known as "Blasting Oil", but it was extremely
   unstable and difficult to transport, as shown in numerous catastrophes.
   The buildings of the Krmmel factory itself were destroyed in 1866 and
   again in 1870.^[20][1]

   In April 1866, the company shipped three unmarked crates of
   nitroglycerin to California for the [21]Central Pacific Railroad, who
   wished to experiment with its blasting capability to speed the
   construction of a tunnel through the [22]Sierra Nevada for the
   [23]First Transcontinental Railroad.^[24][2] One of the crates
   exploded, destroying a [25]Wells Fargo office in [26]San Francisco and
   killing fifteen people, leading to a complete ban on the transport of
   liquid nitroglycerin in California.

   Liquid nitroglycerin was widely banned elsewhere as well, and this
   finally led to Alfred Nobel & Company's development of [27]dynamite in
   1867, made by mixing the nitroglycerin with the
