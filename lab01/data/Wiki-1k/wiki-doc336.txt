[[49]edit] Early life

   Pierce was born on [50]April 4, [51]1922 in [52]Philadelphia to Mary
   Leora Bellinger Pierce and Harold Ernest Pierce, Sr. His mother was a
   pianist who played for [53]Marian Anderson. His family is of
   [54]African, [55]Native American, [56]Haitian and [57]Dutch ancestry.
   He is the oldest of two sons. His brother Honorable [58]Lawrence W.
   Pierce became a federal judge in [59]New York. Their mother died
   prematurely when young Harold was 7 years old and his grandparents
   Lillian A Willets and Warren Wood Pierce of [60]Bridgeton, New Jersey
   raised him and his first cousin Elaine Barnes who was five years his
   junior. His father and he were estranged until young Harold became an
   adult, where he found his father in living in [61]Harlem, an
   impoverished alcoholic.

[[62]edit] Advanced Study

   After graduating from [63]Bridgeton High School in [64]New Jersey,
   Pierce attended [65]Lincoln University in 1942 with a [66]B.S. degree
   and pledged [67]Alpha Phi Alpha. In 1946, he graduated from [68]Howard
   University College of Medicine with an [69]MD degree. Pierce studied
   under the famed [70]Charles Drew while at Howard University. Pierce
   completed an internship at Harlem Hospital in [71]New York City, a
   residency in dermatology at the Philadelphia General Hospital and
   Fellowship in [72]dermatology at the [73]University of Pennsylvania's
   Graduate School of Medicine.

[[74]edit] Family life

   In November 22, 1945, Harold married Constance Ella Mason, a
   [75]mathematician and [76]teacher in the [77]Philadelphia school
   system. They were married for 44 years until her death in 1989. Pierce
   has three adult children, Tamara Pierce McClinton, Sandra Vause, and
   Gregory Pierce. His son also became a [78]cosmetic surgeon and his
   daughter Sandra, became a [79]dermatologist and [80]cosmetic surgeon.
   Both attended his alma maters Howard and Lincoln. His oldest daughter
   Tamara became an [81]attorney. He has two granddaughters and two
   grandsons. One of his granddaughters (Melissa) [82]Safiya Songhai, is
   the third generation to attend [83]Howard University.

[[84]edit] War Years

   In 1951, as the Korean Crisis peaked, Pierce accepted an assignment as
   the Chief of [85]Dermatology at the 1600 USAF Hospital at [86]Westover
   Air Force Base in [87]Massachusetts. In 1954, he became a General
   Medical Officer with the 111th Fighter Bomber. After many distinguished
   years, he resigned from the Air Force National Guard in 1976 and was
   promoted in 1987 on the Retired list to the rank of Brigadier General.
   He is the second [88]African American to be given this ranking.

   Pierce was active in the Civil Rights movement, and even active as a
   child in the 1930s through his dissemination of Black Newspapers
   pushing for an end to the terrorizing [89]lynchings of [90]African
   Americans and their supporters that plagued [91]America throughout the
   first half of the 20th century. After the [92]Daughters of the American
   Revolution barred [93]Marian Anderson from singing at [94]Constitution
   Hall, Dr. Pierce would later join the [95]Sons of the American
   Revolution to protest the segregation, and remind the organization that
   he was living proof that African-Americans also served in the American
   Revolution.

[[96]edit] Author

   Pierce is the editor of the book Cosmetic Plastic Surgery in Nonwhite
   Patients, Grune & Stratton (New York, 1982). He taught for 17 years as
   an assistant professor of [97]dermatology at [98]Howard University.

[[99]edit] Passing

   Pierce died at the age of 84 in [100]Philadelphia from complications
   from [101]prostate cancer. He worked daily as a doctor until the age of
   83. Over five hundred people attended his [102]funeral.
