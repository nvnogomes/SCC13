   Ecto is the fourth album by American singer-songwriter [24]Happy
   Rhodes, released in 1987.

[[25]edit] Overview

   Rhodes' first four albums were not conceived and recorded as album
   releases, but were a gathering together of songs recorded at Cathedral
   Sound Studios from 1984 to 1986. When fellow musician [26]Kevin
   Bartlett offered to release Rhodes' songs on his cassette-only personal
   label Aural Gratification, Rhodes culled through the songs she had
   recorded and ordered them to her satisfaction.

   Originally released as a cassette tape, each copy sold was a 1 to 1
   real-time dub. Ecto was released on CD in 1992 with additional tracks.
   The bonus track When The Rain Came Down was uploaded to the [27]file
   sharing network [28]Napster by an unknown person, and mis-identified as
   a duet between [29]Kate Bush and [30]Annie Lennox, two singers who (as
   of July 2007) have never worked together.
