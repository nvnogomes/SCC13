Edward Cetnarowski

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edward Cetnarowski was a [8]Polish sports official, [9]gynaecologist
   and one of most famous personalities of the sports club [10]Cracovia
   Krakw. He was born October 3, 1877 in [11]Rzeszw and died September 3,
   1933 in [12]Krakw.

   Even though Cetnarowski was regarded as one of the top Polish
   gynecologists (he was an assistant to the famous doctor [13]Henryk
   Jordan), he is most renowned as director of Cracovia, which in the
   1920s and 1930s was one of the strongest sports clubs in Poland. During
   this time, Cracovia, in spite of financial crises shaking Poland,
   became a team known all over Europe. It was he who organized Cracovia's
   tournee to Spain in the mid-1920s. He cared for all sections, including
   [14]soccer.

   Cetnarowski was co-founder of the [15]Polish Football Association
   (PZPN), and in the years 1919-1928 was its official director, and after
   that the honorable director. However, when in 1927 most Polish soccer
   teams, against the will of the PZPN, decided to organize the Soccer
   League, he realized that he had lost and quit. Soon afterwards the seat
   of PZPN was moved from Krakw to [16]Warsaw which indicated that
   Cetnarowski lost almost all influences. It he had always been keen on
   preserving the amateur character of Polish soccer, and this attitude
   became old fashioned as time went by.

   Cetnarowski died suddenly, at the age of 56, during the game of
   Cracovia's female [17]handball team. Most probably, heart failure
   together with excessive weight contributed to his death. The funeral
   was a big event in Krakw, thousands of mourners gathered to bid him
   final farewell.
