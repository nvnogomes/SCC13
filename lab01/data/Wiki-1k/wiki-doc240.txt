   Commuters waiting for the morning train in [14]Maplewood, New Jersey,
   to travel to [15]New York City

   A commuter town is an urban community that is primarily residential,
   from which most of the [16]workforce [17]commute out to earn their
   livelihood. Many commuter towns act as [18]suburbs of a nearby
   [19]metropolis that workers travel to daily, and many suburbs are
   commuter towns. Commuter towns belong to the [20]metropolitan area of a
   city, and a ring of commuter towns around an urban area is known as a
   commuter belt.

   A commuter town may also be known as a bedroom community or "bedroom
   suburb" ([21]Canada and [22]U.S. usage), a dormitory town ([23]UK
   Commonwealth and [24]Ireland usage), or less commonly a dormitory
   village (UK Commonwealth and Ireland). These terms suggest that
   residents sleep in these neighborhoods, but mostly work elsewhere; they
   further suggest that these communities have little commercial or
   industrial activity beyond a small amount of retail, oriented toward
   serving the residents.

[[36]edit] Distinction between suburbs and commuter towns

   [37]Camarillo, California, a typical U.S. bedroom community made up
   almost entirely of homes, schools and retail outlets.

   [38]Suburbs and commuter towns are often the same place, but sometimes
   not. As with [39]college town, [40]resort town, and [41]mill town, the
   term "commuter town" describes the place's predominant economic
   function. A suburb in contrast is a community of lesser size, density,
   political power and/or commerce than a nearby community. Economic
   function may change, for example when improved transport brings
   commuters to industrial suburbs or [42]railway towns in search of
   suburban living. Some suburbs, for example [43]Teterboro, New Jersey
   and [44]Emeryville, California, remain industrial when they become
   surrounded by commuter towns. Many commuters work in such industrial
   suburbs, but few reside, hence they are not commuter towns.

   As a general rule, suburbs are developed in areas adjacent to main
   [45]employment centres, such as a town or a city, but may or may not
   have many jobs locally, whereas bedroom communities have few local
   businesses and most residents who have jobs commute to employment
   centers some distance away. Commuter towns may be in rural or
   semi-rural areas, with a ring of [46]green space separating them from
   the larger city or town. Where [47]urban sprawl and [48]conurbation
   have erased clear lines among towns and cities in large
   [49]metropolitan areas, this is not the case.

[[50]edit] Causes

   Commuter towns can arise for a number of different reasons. Sometimes,
   as in [51]North Tarrytown, New York or [52]Tiburon, California, a town
   loses its main source of employment, leaving its residents to seek work
   elsewhere. In other cases, a pleasant small town over time attracts
   more residents but not large businesses to employ them, requiring them
   to commute to employment centers. Another cause, particularly relevant
   in the American South and West, is the rapid growth of once-small
   cities. Owing largely to the earlier creation of the [53]Interstate
   Highway System; the greatest growth was seen by the sprawling
   metropolitan areas of these cities. As a result many small cities were
   absorbed into the suburbs of these larger cities.

   Often, however, commuter towns form when workers in a region cannot
   afford to live where they work and must seek residency in another town
   with a lower [54]cost of living. The late 20th century [55]Dot-com
   bubble and [56]United States housing bubble drove housing affordability
   in Californian metropolitan areas to historic lows, spawning exurban
   growth in adjacent counties. For example, most cities in [57]Riverside
   County, California can be considered exurbs of Los Angeles and San
   Diego. As of 2003^[58][update], over 80% of the workforce of [59]Tracy,
   California was employed in the [60]San Francisco Bay Area.

   A related phenomenon is common in the [61]resort towns of the
   [62]American West that require large workforces but emphasize building
   "[63]McMansions" and other expensive housing. For example, the resort
   town of [64]Jackson, Wyoming has spawned several nearby bedroom
   communities, including [65]Victor, Idaho; [66]Driggs, Idaho; and
   [67]Alpine, Wyoming, where the majority of the Jackson workforce
   resides. Many of the workforce who serve [68]The Hamptons also reside
   in communities more modest and more suburban than their workplace,
   giving rise to a daily reverse commuter flow from more dense to less
   dense areas.

   In certain major European cites, such as [69]London and [70]Berlin,
   commuter towns were founded in response to bomb damage in [71]World War
   II. Residents were relocated to semi-rural areas within a 50-mile
   (80 km) radius, firstly because much inner city housing had been
   destroyed, and secondly in order to stimulate development away from
   cities as the industrial infrastructure shifted from rail to road.
   Around London, several towns such as [72]Stevenage, [73]Basildon, and
   [74]Crawley were built for this purpose by the [75]Commission for New
   Towns.

[[76]edit] Effects

   Where commuters are wealthier and small town housing markets weaker
   than city housing markets, the development of a bedroom community may
   raise local housing prices and attract upscale service businesses in a
   process akin to [77]gentrification. Long-time residents may be
   displaced by new commuter residents due to rising house prices. This
   can also be influenced by [78]zoning restrictions in urbanized areas
   that prevent the construction of suitably cheap housing closer to
   places of employment.

   The number of commuter towns increased in the [79]U.S. the [80]UK and
   [81]Ireland during the 20th century because of a trend for people to
   move out of the cities into the surrounding [82]green belt.
   Historically, commuter towns were developed by railway companies to
   create demand for their lines. One 1920s pioneer of this form of
   development was the [83]Metropolitan Railway (now part of [84]London
   Underground) which marketed its [85]Metro-land developments. This
   initiative encouraged many to move out of central and inner-city
   [86]London (to suburban London boroughs such as [87]Harrow) and out of
   London itself, to [88]commuter villages in [89]Buckinghamshire or
   [90]Hertfordshire.^[[91]citation needed] Commuter towns have more
   recently been built ahead of adequate transportation infrastructure,
   thus spurring the development of roads and [92]public transportation
   systems. These can take the form of [93]light rail lines extending from
   the city centre to new [94]streetcar suburbs and new or expanded
   [95]highways, whose construction and [96]traffic can lead to the
   community becoming part of a larger [97]conurbation.

   In the United States, it is common for commuter towns to create
   disparities in municipal tax rates. When a commuter town collects few
   business taxes, residents must pay the brunt of the public operating
   budget in higher [98]property or [99]income taxes. Such municipalities
   may scramble to encourage [100]commercial growth once an established
   [101]residential base has been reached.

[[102]edit] Exurbs

   The expression "exurb" (for "extra-urban") was coined in the 1950s, by
   [103]Auguste Comte Spectorsky to describe the ring of prosperous
   communities beyond the [104]suburbs that are commuter towns for an
   urban area.^[105][1] Most exurbs serve as commuter towns, but most
   commuter towns are not exurban.

   Exurbs are not unique to the United States. They are also found in
   other land-rich developed countries, notably [106]Canada. Reasons for
   exurban growth vary. In the 1970s, rampant crime and [107]urban decay
   in U.S. cities was the primary 'push force', whereas exurban growth has
   continued in the 2000s even as most U.S. cities experience plummeting
   crime and urban revitalization. However, house prices have skyrocketed,
   so middle-class people who want a large yard or farm are pushed beyond
   suburban counties.

   Exurbs vary in wealth and education level. Exurban areas typically have
   much higher college education levels than closer-in suburbs, and have
   average incomes much higher than nearby rural counties. Depending on
   local circumstances, some exurbs have higher poverty levels than
   suburbs nearer the city. Others (like [108]Loudoun County, Virginia
   outside [109]Washington, D.C. and [110]Ozaukee County, Wisconsin near
   [111]Milwaukee) have some of the highest median household incomes in
   their respective metropolitan areas.

[[112]edit] Then and now

   Commuters from early exurbs, such as the end of [113]Philadelphia's
   [114]Main Line and Upper [115]Westchester County, New York, reached the
   city center via [116]commuter rail and [117]parkway systems.

   Today's exurbs are composed of small neighborhoods in otherwise
   [118]bucolic areas, towns, and (comparatively) small cities. Some lie
   in the outer suburbs of an urbanized area, but a few miles of rural,
   wooded, or agricultural land separates many exurbs from the suburbs.
   Exurbs that originated independently of the major city to which many
   residents commute may feature some cultural institutions or
   universities of their own. Others, by contrast, consist almost
   exclusively of commuters and lack the historical and cultural
   traditions of more established cities. Many early 20th century exurbs
   were organized on the principles of the [119]garden city movement.

   Yesterday's sprawling exurbs, such as [120]Forest Hills, Queens and
   [121]Garden City, New York often become a later decade's suburbs,
   surrounded and absorbed into a belt of [122]infill.

[[123]edit] Planning

   Some communities that lie outside the city proper of a metropolitan
   area could also be considered exurbs (such as in the American
   West^[124][2]), whereas those inside the municipal boundaries are often
   known as suburbs. Many suburbs within the metropolitan city proper
   enjoyed their greatest growth in the post-World War II period and
   slowed subsequently; since the 1990s, extensive development has
   occurred outside of the city. There have also been significant growth
   differences between inside and outside metro boundaries; many
   developments typical of exurbs such as [125]big box retailers lie just
   on the outside, due to older suburbs being governed by careful
   inner-city land-use politics while communities outside are more willing
   to develop greenfield sites.

   Some [126]environmentalists, [127]architects, and [128]urban planners
   consider exurbs to be manifestations of poor or distorted
   [129]planning. Extremely low densities often featuring large lots and
   "[130]McMansions" create heavy [131]car dependency. This also makes the
   construction of municipal infrastructure and deployment of services
   unusually costly and inefficient. Such communities typically include
   [132]big box stores, [133]fast food chains, and large [134]shopping
   malls, but lack amenities such as [135]parks and cultural institutions.
   Nevertheless, relatively cheap land, cheap fuel, and low taxes fuel
   rapid economic and population growth in many exurbs. Many [136]Middle
   class families with children are attracted to low costs, ample private
   space, and the lower crime rates compared with more intensively
   developed areas.^[[137]citation needed]

   "They begin as embryonic subdivisions of a few hundred homes at the far
   edge of beyond, surrounded by scrub. Then, they grow first gradually,
   but soon with explosive force attracting stores, creating jobs and
   struggling to keep pace with the need for more schools, more roads,
   more everything. And eventually, when no more land is available and
   home prices have skyrocketed, the whole cycle starts again, another 15
   minutes down the turnpike."

   Rick Lyman, New York Times ^[138][3]

   In Britain, there is very strict regulation about building on
   [139]Greenfield sites, so planning in these areas is quite rare.
   Instead developers more increasingly find themselves building on
   [140]Brownfield sites around British cities.

[[141]edit] On Paradise Drive

   In his book [142]On Paradise Drive, [143]conservative writer [144]David
   Brooks commented on the massive growth of American exurbs in the 1990s
   and early 2000s, and noted that these communities are now dependent on
   industries contained in [145]office parks in the suburbs rather than in
   the city center, producing (and attracting) populations with no
   connection to urban city life. Brooks attributes the victory of
   [146]George W. Bush in the 2004 election to votes from exurbs and
   states his belief that the Democratic Party failed to connect with
   voters in exurbs.
