[[46]edit] History

   Dragon was established in 1987, as a sister company to model retailer
   Universal Models Limited (UML), to manufacture plastic model kits
   according to its own designs, so that UML would be less reliant on
   imported products. For the next decade Dragon focused only on models of
   [47]military vehicles. It later began to share distribution agreement
   with model companies of other countries, so that their products could
   be exported worldwide. Since its founding it has released more than
   1,000 items.^[48][1]

   In 1997 Dragon diversified into other model fields. It started
   manufacturing a line of 1/400 airliner models called Dragon Wings,
   which is now one of Dragon's most important series. In 1999, Dragon
   introduced its styrene, 1:6 scale New Generation Life Action Figure
   series. The series currently encompasses more than 400 releases.

   To capitalize on the success of Dragon Wings, Dragon introduced the
   Warbirds in 2002. A line of 1/72 scale diecast fighter aircraft, the
   series included both World War II and modern day planes. In 2003 Dragon
   began to manufacture 1/72 die-cast tank models to accompany Warbirds,
   marketed with the label "Dragon Armor".

   As a military model maker, Dragon is distinguishable from other makers
   in that Dragon often has most number of parts, i.e. catering toward top
   end experienced modellers, rather than beginners.

[[49]edit] Product Lines

[[50]edit] Military Miniatures/Plastic Model Kits

   The oldest category in Dragon's export line is the "Military
   Miniatures" series of scale figures and vehicles available in kit form.
   Many of these kits are marketed as "3 in 1", which means modellers can
   create one of three variations of the vehicle from the same kit. The
   series focuses on mostly [51]World War II-era military subjects.
   Dragon's kits are typically aimed towards more skilled or experienced
   modellers, because the inclusion of metal accessories and smaller parts
   necessitates the usage of different glue and finer tools. However,
   Dragon is also trying to appeal to the more casual audience through its
   current release of 'Smart Kits' (see below). A kit is usually packaged
   in a box with a painting of the vehicle alongside photos of the
   completed model. Unlike its competitors, the number of parts of a kit
   is always printed on the box.^[[52]citation needed]

   Recently, Dragon is also rapidly expanding its 1/72 scale production
   line. Rare or paper-only vehicles like the [53]German [54]E-100 and
   [55]Maus are being manufactured in this scale. While smaller, these
   kits still feature photo-etched parts and decals common in [56]1/35
   kits.

   Beginning 2005, Dragon upgraded a number of its kits to include new
   features, as well as smaller parts for added details. Most of these
   kits also included [57]decals printed by [58]Cartograf, an [59]Italian
   decal maker.

[[60]edit] Magic Tracks and EZ tracks

   'Magic Tracks' are individual track links that come in a bag, ready to
   be assembled without the tedious work of removing them from [61]sprues.
   Magic Tracks are designed to snap together through a tight friction
   fit, so that the track can be more easily assembled than tracks molded
   with sprues. However, glue is still needed after the assembly.^[62][2]

   Contrary to Dragon's claims of completely effortless assembly, cleaning
   the links up is still required, since each link has knock-out pin marks
   left behind from the molding process. [63]Injection molding limitations
   also mean that tracks are not as detailed as traditional link tracks,
   for example missing the tiny holes in the guide horns of [64]Tiger
   I.^[65][3]

[[66]edit] One-Piece DS Tracks

   A few of Dragon's newer kits, such as its [67]Sherman M4A2 kit, include
   one-piece tracks made from 'Dragon Styrene 100' (DS), a plastic
   developed by Dragon's own [68]Research and Development team. A cross
   breed of [69]polystyrene and [70]vinyl, DS is an attempt to combine the
   advantages of the two materials. Delicate details can be reproduced
   with DS using under-cut molding, reducing the number of small parts.
   The [71]Tiger I hollow guide horns, for example, can be replicated on
   DS using slide-mold technology.^[72][4] These tracks can also be joined
   with normal plastic cement.

   Some recent DS tracks seem to have an issue of being too long or too
   loose.^[73][5] The tracks may also come stretched due to packaging
   limitation, but the issue can be resolved by soaking the tracks in hot
   water. ^[74][6]

[[75]edit] Photo-etched Parts

   Dragon almost always includes a small amount of [76]photo-etched brass
   in its kits. Originally Dragon relied heavily on photo-etched parts to
   model engine deck screens, but it has since expanded its use of
   photo-etching to include optional parts like chains and fenders. Photo
   etched brass parts are used in kits to make small or delicate parts
   that are harder to make in scale from plastic, such as miniature eye
   glasses, medals, seat belts, machine gun mounts, intake screens, etc.

   In addition to photo-etched parts straight from the kit, Dragon also
   manufactures a small amount of separate photo-etched detail sets. It
   also has distribution agreement with [77]Chinese model accessories
   company [78]Lion Roar to sell and market Lion Roar's detail sets, which
   are available for kits from Dragon and other model companies.

[[79]edit] Decals

   Like its competitors, Dragon also includes [80]decals in its kits.
   While Dragon sometimes prints its own decal sheets, it usually uses
   decals printed by [81]Cartograf, an [82]Italian decal maker.

[[83]edit] Metal Parts

   Metal parts are used by Dragon to enhance the realism of their models.
   Turned [84]aluminum barrels, metal tow cables, [85]brass antenna and
   brass ammunition shells are common parts included in Dragon kits as an
   alternative to styrene parts. Small metal parts may also be included to
   accurately replicate a tank's wheels and lamp wiring. Some kits have as
   many as 48 metal parts. ^[86][7]

[[87]edit] Slide Molding

   Although it is not a new technique, the use of slide molds allows more
   accurate reproduction of details than traditional two-piece molds. This
   is done by using [88]injection molds with moving parts (known as
   "slides") that are inserted into the mold to form parts and then
   removed so the part can be extracted from the mold. It helps increase
   the authenticity of the model and reduce the number of parts by molding
   details onto larger parts. Weld patterns between plates, gratings,
   one-piece hull and turret interior are common features included in
   Dragon kits.^[89][8] The usage of slide mold technology has caused
   Dragon to rely less on photo-etched parts (See Smart Kit, below).

[[90]edit] Smart Kits

   According to Dragon, 'Smart Kits' are designed to be easier to build,
   without sacrificing the level of detail. Extra engineering has been
   invested in these kits, so that the construction of the models is more
   straightforward. Extensive use of slide molding techniques means
   crisply-detailed parts are reproduced without the need of photo etched
   parts. Hence the kits can be built out of the box by most modelers
   using standard construction techniques.^[91][9] A 'Smart Kit' generally
   costs less than ordinary Dragon kits, because of the inclusion of fewer
   metal parts. However, Dragon emphasizes that the model has not in any
   way become simpleronly the assembly is less tedious.^[92][10]

   Dragon has so far released nine Smart Kits, the first being a
   [93]Panther G.

[[94]edit] Dragon Wings(1/400 scale)

   In 1997, Dragon started the Dragon Wings line of 1/400 scale aircraft,
   aiming not only at collectors but also airline companies who need
   display models. These models are sold fully finished. Over 100
   commercial and national airline models have been released since then.
   Dragon is the officially appointed supplier of aircraft models for
   Airbus and Boeing for their promotional and souvenir
   purposes.^[[95]citation needed]

[[96]edit] Military Figures (1/6 scale)

   In 1999, Dragon introduced its New Generation Life Action Figure
   series. The series features fully posable military and licensed 12-inch
   figures with cloth uniforms, weapons and equipment. The series
   currently stands at some 400-plus individual releases, with subjects
   varying from World War II, Modern Special Operations and Law
   Enforcement, to licensed character figures from movies, popular music,
   sports, electronic games and comics. The curral equipment ranging up to
   paratroopers with aircraft walls and functioning parachutes.
     * Other action figure/model kit series:

                Warrior Series (1/16) - Figures of tank crew and infantry
                World's Elite Force Series (1/35)
                'Nam' Series (1/35)
                54mm Figures

[[97]edit] Die-cast models (1/72 scale)

   Dragon has released 'The Warbirds' line of mainly 1/72 scale die-cast
   fighter aircraft ranging from WWII classics to the modern day aircraft.
   In 2003 Dragon introduced another line of die-cast models - Dragon
   Armor - to complement with its Warbirds series of fighter aircraft.
   Dragon also markets a line of 1/144 models ('Panzer Korps') of German
   WWII and modern tanks.

[[98]edit] Facilities

   Dragon has several large regional divisions. The most notable is in
   [99]Shanghai, China, which produces its own exclusive lines of
   products. Its headquarters is located in [100]Tsuen Wan, [101]Hong
   Kong.

   Its [102]US branch, which is responsible for marketing and distributing
   products for Dragon and other affiliated model companies in the US, is
   located in [103]Industry, [104]Southern California.

[[105]edit] Sister Companies

   The founder of Dragon has also created two other companies, Universal
   Models Limited (UML) and [106]Concord Publications.

   UML was founded in 1974 as a hobby shop in [107]Waterloo Road,
   [108]Kowloon and relies on importing plastic kit sets from other parts
   of the world. The founding of Dragon is therefore a [109]backward
   vertical expansion, serving to ensure a steady input of goods for UML.
   Currently UML has four retail outlets in Hong Kong, including their
   flagship [110]mega store in [111]Nathan Road, [112]Mong Kok, opened in
   2004, which is claimed to be the largest hobby store in Hong
   Kong.^[113][11] The original store is one of the few businesses to be
   associated with the street.

   [114]Concord Publications, founded in 1980, is a publisher of paperback
   military books. The magazines and books published by Concord serve as a
   tool to promote and advertise the products that UML and Dragon is
   selling.
