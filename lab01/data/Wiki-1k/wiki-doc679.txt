   eXpanded MultiPlayer (XMP) is a [10]multiplayer expansion to [11]Unreal
   II developed by [12]Legend Entertainment. XMP contains just one game
   mode that is similar to [13]Capture the flag but requires more
   sophisticated tactics.

   (December 2007)

   [50]Unreal II: eXpanded MultiPlayer was developed by [51]Legend
   Entertainment for [52]Atari to deliver on the original promise to
   extend the original [53]single player game Unreal II with a
   [54]multiplayer functionality. The first playable version was released
   and made available for download on [55]December 9, [56]2003. Almost
   nearing completion, the development of the game was suddenly halted by
   the unexpected close-down of [57]Legend Entertainment on [58]January
   16, [59]2004.

   Although the single player edition of Unreal II was disappointing to
   fans of the original Unreal,^[[60]citation needed] the online
   multiplayer add-on (XMP) is considered a sophisticated and addictive
   multiplayer game.^[[61]citation needed] Realistic graphics and visually
   stunning maps^[[62]citation needed] complement class-based game play in
   a cooperative environment - a departure from the frag-fest environment
   of the various Unreal multiplayer brethren. Players who gain experience
   and hone skills, such as wall jumping (Ranger class), concussion
   jumping (Gunner class) and other maneuvers, are rewarded through game
   points. While the XMP community has suffered serious setbacks with the
   loss of master server support and the closing of Legend
   Entertertainment, a small community of players still meet on a daily
   basis^[[63]citation needed] for lively sessions on a variety of maps.

[[64]edit] Master server

   As XMP is a pure online game living from game servers hosted over the
   world. It is quite dependent on a server which the user's XMP copy
   queries for online game servers. As this master server crashed often
   and the manufacturing company stopped support for the game, it was not
   easy to find online games for XMP newbies.

   An XMP fan later implemented his own master server, so that users can
   find online servers easily again.

[[66]edit] Gameplay

   XMP is a team-based game, where the players are split into two teams,
   red and blue. Both teams have a base with an Artifact Node. Each
   Artifact Node initially contains two Artifacts. (XMP players often
   refer to these as "Artis".) The main objective is to steal the enemy's
   Artifacts and then register them at your own Artifact Node, both
   accomplished by running through the appropriate Artifact Node.

   The game relies on some basic concepts, which make XMP unique:
     * Three classes: The player can play as a Ranger, a Tech or a Gunner,
       each with its own pros and cons,
     * Energy: Every action costs energy; each team has to ensure a
       sufficient energy level at all times,
     * Vehicles: Three different vehicle types enhance gameplay,
     * Teamplay: The team with better collaboration is more likely to win
       the game.

[[67]edit] Hacking

   Some of the items in the game can be hacked to be owned by the hacking
   team. The two most important things to be hacked are Energy Generators
   and Deploy Points, but you can also hack panels of some doors and
   lifts. To hack an item, stand close to it, press and hold the key you
   have bound to "Use". A progress bar will appear. When it is full, the
   item belongs to your team and you will hear the announcer say something
   like "Your team has gained <your item here>". While you are hacking,
   you are an easy target for the enemy, so it is a good idea to wait for
   the opportune moment to hack a given item, or otherwise call a teammate
   to provide some cover.

   A special way of "hacking" is treating teammates. The player can always
   approach and "use" them. Depending on the actual player class the
   teammate can either be healed (Ranger), repaired (Tech) or resupplied
   (Gunner).

   The speed of hacking items depends on the player class and the actual
   personal energy reserve. Techs hack fastest, Gunners and Rangers take
   longer to hack. All three classes treat (heal, repair, or supply)
   teammates at the same speed. However, if the player's personal energy
   supply is depleted (e.g. due to excessive use of the jump pack) hacking
   and treating will take significantly longer.

[[68]edit] Energy

   What makes XMP different from typical CTF is Energy. Energy is required
   for almost everything in the game: weapons, vehicles and even the
   player's advanced movements. Autonomous mechanical defenses (so-called
   "Deployables") consume the most energy. Without Energy you cannot
   register the enemy's Artifacts as your own, drop turrets and so on.
   Each map has a number of Generators which can be hacked by each team to
   provide energy. Each Generator contributes to your team's energy level
   at a specific rate. To register Artifacts, your team must have at least
   a level of 800 Energy. For every 50 Energy from 800 down to 500 the
   team gains/loses a function which is announced like this: Red/blue team
   "item" are online/offline.

   There are two separate supplies of Energy a player is concerned with:
   their team's Energy supply (the tall blue bar to the extreme lower
   right of the HUD) and their personal Energy reserve (the short yellow
   bar to the immediate left of the team energy bar). The personal Energy
   reserve is depleted when performing any of the 'advanced' functions of
   the game; ie. hacking an object, deploying a turret or a mine, healing
   a teammate or activating jump jets. Some things, however, draw directly
   from the team's energy reserve, such as deployed turrets, or driving or
   firing from a vehicle. The player's personal reserve is refilled from
   the team's Energy bank; therefore, if every team member 'spends' their
   energy frivolously, the team will soon find itself without defenses,
   vehicles, or even a place to register stolen artifacts. For this
   reason, a player should handle their energy responsibly, at least until
   their team has enough Generators under its control to support multiple
   energy-intensive activities.

[[69]edit] Deploy Points

   A Deploy Point is a place where you can [70]spawn after being killed.
   You do not need to redeploy every time after being killed, as any other
   player can revive you. However, when you are revived you start with one
   health point (although you can still be healed back to full health by a
   Ranger).

   Most Deploy Points can be hacked like Generators, except for the ones
   closest to either team's base. It is good to have as many Deploy Points
   as possible, since that will both increase your potential starting
   points, as well as limit those of your enemy. Every Deploy Point has a
   deploy time which means that you will have to wait for the countdown of
   the current time cycle to be able to deploy.

   Pressing the 'Jump' key repeatedly while waiting to respawn allows a
   player to cycle through all of his team's available Deploy Points, in
   order to spawn at a key location or to get back into the action
   quicker. Viewing each Deploy Point will also display a list of
   teammates: white names are live teammates that spawned from the Point
   in question, while grayed-out names are teammates that have been killed
   and are waiting at this Deploy Point. An icon next to each teammate's
   name also displays their class: a medic's cross for a Ranger, a wrench
   for a Tech and a bullet for a Gunner.

[[71]edit] Scoring

   Each successful action increases the player's personal score while all
   negative actions decrease it. Individual scores of the team members are
   neither added up nor are they of any importance to win the game.
   however, they are a good hint to the personal performance of the team
   members and also the overall success of the complete team.

   The individual scores can always be displayed by all players with the
   <F1> key. The "most valuable players" by score can always be retrieved
   with the <F2> key and will also be listed in the loading screen of the
   next map after the current game ends.

[[72]edit] Winning

   There are two ways for your team to win the game:
     * Steal and register all four Artifacts at your Artifact Node,
     * Hack and keep all Generators until the enemy runs out of Energy.

   If neither of the two options is achieved when the game time runs out,
   no team wins according to the original game rules. In some leagues
   however, a custom rule is enforced so possessing more Artifacts than
   the enemy will also win the game.

[[73]edit] Communication

   There are several possibilities how you can talk to other players in a
   match. Most important (because available to all players) is the
   in-game-chat. Standard key for typing chat messages to be seen by all
   players is 'T'. If you want to type messages only to be read by your
   teammates, the standard key is 'Y'. Key bindings for that can be
   changed either in Options menu of the game or manually in the
   MyUser.ini file. If team messages are sent, the player's current
   location on the map is displayed after the player's name and before the
   actual message.

   XMP also supports voice messages which can be bound to any key. There
   are 39 possible voice messages which are spoken during a match by your
   avatar. Each player class has its own voice, so a gunner sounds
   different from a ranger or a tech. It's possible to let all players
   hear (and read) a message or only the players of your team.
   Additionally to the speaking, your avatar also sends out a chat
   message. The voice messages can also be invoked from console with
   either the command 'speech <number>' '(for sending it to all players)
   or 'teamspeech <number>' (for sending only to your team). Those
   commands are the same that can be put in the MyUser.ini file. The
   following commands are implemented (starting with the number):
     * 0. "Acknowledged."
     * 1. "All clear."
     * 2. "Get in the vehicle."
     * 3. "I've got an artifact!"
     * 4. "I need backup!"
     * 5. "We need defense!"
     * 6. "We need more deploy points!"
     * 7. "We need energy!"
     * 8. "I need a medic!"
     * 9. "I need repairs!"
     * 10. "I need supplies!"
     * 11. "No problem."
     * 12. "Sorry."
     * 13. "Thanks."
     * 14. "Incoming!"
     * 15. "Wait up!"
     * 16. "Affirmative!"
     * 17. "Negative."
     * 18. "Nice shot!"
     * 19. "On my way."
     * 20. "Same team!"
     * 21. "At the base."
     * 22. "At the generator."
     * 23. "I'm on defense."
     * 24. "I'm on offense."
     * 25. "Cover me."
     * 26. "Follow me."
     * 27. "I need a ride."
     * 28. "I need health."
     * 29. "Someone revive me!"
     * 30. "<--- I'm hacking this."
     * 31. "<--- We now own this."
     * 32. "Get rid of those deployables!"
     * 33. "Hack their DeployPoints!"
     * 34. "We need more automated defenses!"
     * 35. "Enemy in our base!"
     * 36. "I've dropped an artifact!"
     * 37. "<--- I've heavily mined this area!"
     * 38. "<--- There's a live Juggernaut here."

   Any message, speech or plain chat, directed specifically at the team,
   is also accompanied by a location label in parentheses behind the
   player's username. This is useful in conjunction with speech messages
   such as 30, 31, 37 and 38 to let the team know where something is
   happening, as it saves the time normally spent asking 'Where are you?'
   or something to that effect.

   XMP does not come with a built-in support for communication through a
   headset ([74]Voice over IP). But it is of course possible to use
   external programs like [75]TeamSpeak, [76]Roger Wilco or [77]Ventrilo
   to establish that during a game.

   Communication during a match can be vital for the outgoing of a game.
   Your team mates can react on certain messages immediately. E.g., if an
   artifact has been stolen and you see the artifact carrier, a very
   important thing is to tell your teammates about that, either through
   team chat or a headset.

[[78]edit] Classes

   In XMP, players can choose to spawn as one of three [79]character
   classes. The classes have several different attributes, such as speed,
   armor and weapons. All three character classes have the same amount of
   health (100).

   All classes have a stamina bar and the ability to sprint; sprinting
   roughly doubles the player's base speed (determined by their class) and
   depletes their stamina bar at a constant rate. In vehicles this is
   represented instead by a turbo bar, activated by the driver with the
   same key. Sprinting, predictably, also allows for longer jumps, and is
   necessary (in combination with jump jets and mantling) to reach certain
   areas of the map. The player's speed is represented by a tall blue bar
   to the lower left of the HUD and an abstract value next to it; stamina
   is represented by the short yellow bar to the immediate right of the
   speed indicator.

   All classes also have the ability to "mercy kill" (or, as it is often
   called in-game, "KO-wn") enemies which have been killed and are waiting
   for revival by a teammate. Those enemy players can be recognized by a
   skull symbol hovering over their twitching body. To KO-wn an enemy,
   approach him until you can see the progress bar, then press the "Use"
   key. KO-wning disallows the enemy player to be revived by friendly
   Medics or watch his surroundings, and forces him to redeploy at one of
   his team's current Deploy Points.

   The third and final ability available to all three classes is the use
   of 'jump jets'. These are, very simply, small jet boosters each player
   carries on their back that assist in defying gravity by providing a
   short but powerful burst of upwards momentum. Jump jets are activated
   by pressing the 'Jump' key a second time before touching the ground.
   Combined with a player's other inherent abilities such as jumping and
   dodging, in addition to a good sense of timing, jump jets can:
     * When triggered at the apex of a straight jump, increase the jump's
       height; the absolute gain in height varies per class. Obviously the
       Gunner, being the heaviest class, cannot jump as high as the
       Ranger.
     * When triggered at the end of a long jump, increase the jump's
       length; the same class-based weight modifiers are effective with
       regard to the actual distance gained.
     * When triggered simultaneously with a dodge (a double-tap of the
       'Left' or 'Right' key, resulting in a short, quick dash in that
       direction) allows a faster, longer, jet-powered dodge move that can
       also be triggered in midair.
     * When triggered soon before hitting the ground after a fall or a
       jump from an extreme height, prevent loss of health from falling
       damage. What actually happens is the maximum upwards momentum
       provided by the jets is subtracted from the downwards momentum
       gained by the falling player; in the case of a light fall this is
       often enough to stop the player in midair and set them falling
       again, obviously causing less (or no) damage upon impact (a skilled
       player can time this to occur just before impact for an extremely
       light landing). In the case of a severe fall, however, such as from
       the upper level of the map XMP-Alcazar, the jump jets often merely
       slow the player slightly, as the accumulated momentum from falling
       far exceeds that provided by the jets.

   Jump jets may only be activated once per jump; once the player touches
   the ground they immediately recharge.

[[80]edit] Ranger

   The Ranger is XMP's lightest class and therefore the fastest; however
   he has the lowest amount of Shield (100).

[[81]edit] Weapons

   The Ranger has the following weapons:
     * Sniper Rifle with zoom function,
     * Pistol,
     * Grenade Launcher (fragmentation or smoke grenades).
     * Shock Lance (best used to destroy deployables e.g. turrets).

   This player class doesn't carry any mechanical Deployables.

[[82]edit] Skills

   The Ranger can heal teammates by approaching and "using" them. If there
   is sufficient Energy he can also throw Health Packs which can be picked
   up by any player (including the enemy team!).

[[83]edit] Tech

   The Tech is a middle-weight class with medium amounts of Shield (300)
   and speed.

[[84]edit] Weapons

   The Tech has the following weapons:
     * Assault Rifle,
     * Shotgun,
     * Grenade Launcher ([85]EMP or toxic gas grenades).

   Depending on his team's actual energy level he can also deploy Auto
   Turrets, Rocket Turrets, and Force Walls (electric fences). Those
   Deployables consume a lot of the team's Energy, so it has to be ensured
   there is always enough of it by hacking and holding Generators.

[[86]edit] Skills

   Techs can repair the shield of his teammates by approaching and "using"
   them. If there is sufficient Energy he can also throw Shield Packs
   which can be picked up by any player (also those of the enemy team).

[[87]edit] Gunner

   The Gunner (Also called "Gunny") is a slow player if you count out
   concussionjumping and lasertripminejumping, but with the highest amount
   of shield (500).

[[88]edit] Weapons

   The Gunner has the following weapons:
     * [89]Rocket Launcher,
     * Flamethrower,
     * Grenade Launcher (incendiary or concussion grenades).

   Depending on his team's actual energy level he can also deploy
   [90]Laser [91]Trip Mines and Land Mines. Those Deployables consume a
   lot of the team's Energy, so it has to be ensured there is always
   enough of it by hacking and holding Generators.

[[92]edit] Skills

   Gunners can repair the supply teammates by approaching and "using"
   them. If there is sufficient Energy he can also throw Supply Packs
   which can be picked up by any player (also those of the enemy team).

   Due to a bug in the game a teammate revived by a Gunner starts with
   full ammo, instead of the amount he died with.

[[93]edit] Vehicles

   XMP has three vehicles: Raptor, Harbinger and Juggernaut. Like the
   player classes, each vehicle type has specific advantages and
   disadvantages over the other ones, like speed, armor and weaponry.
   Vehicles do not need to be hacked to be available to one of the two
   teams and cannot be repaired. However, driving a vehicle or firing a
   vehicle weapon uses energy from the team's reserve. After they are
   destroyed they will respawn at their original spawn points. For all
   vehicles, whether in the driver's seat or manning a vehicle weapon,
   alt-fire will send teamspeech message 2 ("Get in the vehicle.") to the
   team.

   A useful side note is that vehicles are also affected by falling
   damage; landing with the wheels down usually dampens this effect
   slightly (as opposed to landing on the front end or upside-down, as has
   been known to occur, particularly from very steep falls or from
   travelling off an edge at high speed), however, vehicles are much more
   sensitive to damage than players, and due to their tendency to explode
   when disabled in any way, a fall that would remove half a player's
   health is likely to destroy their vehicle completely and take them with
   it, also often making them inaccessible for reviving due to the
   burnt-out wreck of the vehicle on top of their corpse. Exploding
   vehicles have a very limited splash damage radius, however, with most
   of the damage being directed at the occupants, and combined with the
   fact that a player's momentum is set to 0 upon exiting from a vehicle,
   a skilled player can survive an otherwise fatal fall by piloting a
   vehicle off the edge in question, exiting a good distance above the
   ground, continuing to fall unaided and softening his final landing with
   his jump jets. The resultant avoidance of death, revival and/or
   redeploying in this case more than makes up for the loss of mobility
   incurred by the inevitably destroyed vehicle.

   All vehicles also have their own stamina reserve, separate from the
   player's, called a turbo boost. When the turbo gauge (that replaces an
   occupying player's stamina bar) is full, a speed boost can be triggered
   by pressing the "Sprint"-key (usually <Alt>). The boost has the same
   effect as sprinting; it roughly doubles the vehicle's speed of movement
   until the boost is depleted. It tends to last for much less time than a
   sprint, but also recharges much faster.

[[94]edit] Viewing Angles

   While sitting on the driver's seat the perspective can be switched
   between 1st and 3rd person with the <F11> key. In 3rd person view the
   Vehicle is shown from the perspective of a camera hovering somewhat
   over and behind the vehicle. Using the mouse the camera direction can
   be tilt in a 180 degree angle.

[[95]edit] Raptor

   [96]File:Raptor-boosting.jpg
   Raptor in Action

   The Raptor ("Rap") is a small and speedy [97]buggy with room for 2
   players (Driver, and a mannable turret on top). The downside is that it
   has the weakest armor of all three vehicles. The Raptor's center of
   gravity is towards the rear, allowing for some tight turns. When
   utilizing the turbo boost, Raptor drivers are rewarded with bright
   flames spewing from the exaggerated exhaust pipes to either side of the
   vehicle's chassis.

   Example: To do a sharp turn to the left or the right, the <Down> and
   <Left> or <Right> keys can be pressed simultanuously.

   Depending on the consistency of the ground hard turns into one
   direction can make the Raptor [98]oversteer, resulting in a few pretty
   [99]doughnuts.

[[100]edit] Gutblowing

   The Raptor has two meat grinders attached to the front. Hitting enemies
   with them results in a "[101]gutblow", instantly killing the player and
   making him incapable of being revived.

   Note that teammates can't be gutblown. However, hitting them with the
   Raptor can also [102]teamkill them.

   Because of the uneven terrain of certain maps it may be possible to
   avoid a gutblow by crouching.

[[103]edit] Honking

   To warn teammates and enemy players the Raptor has a built-in horn,
   which can be triggered by the driver with the "Fire"-control (Default
   is left mouse-button). Pressing the control immediately after speed
   boosting with full turbo boost results in a "Special Honk": the first
   12 notes of "[104]Dixie", similar to the [105]General Lee from [106]The
   Dukes of Hazzard. Also during the "Special Honk", a faint "Yee-haw" can
   be heard from the vehicle, assumed to be from the driving player
   (Although, the voice is the same regardless of the class of the
   player).

[[107]edit] Harbinger

   The Harbinger ("Harby") has medium armor and speed and fits three
   people: one driver, one who operates the rocket launcher on top, and
   one who operates the rear-mounted EMP cannon (the Ball Turret, named so
   because of its shape). Its high center of gravity means it has a
   tendency to topple over at high speeds.

[[108]edit] Honking

   The Harby has a powerful, deep horn to warn all pedestrians. It can be
   triggered with the "fire"-control.

[[109]edit] Juggernaut

   The Juggernaut is XMP's [110]tank and the most heavily armoured
   vehicle, but also the slowest. The Juggernaut has spots for two people:
   one driver and one gunner who operates the very powerful top-mounted
   cannon. The driver has also access to a flamethrower which can be used
   to kill opponents at close range.

[[111]edit] Weapons

[[112]edit] Deployables

   Deployables can be deployed by a Tech or a Gunner. The Tech can place
   Auto Turrets, Rocket Turrets and Force Walls. The Gunner can place
   Laser Trip Mines or Land Mines. Land mines explode when someone steps
   on, or close to them. They can also be detonated by most weapons. Laser
   trip mines explode when someone breaks the laser beam.

   While Deployables can greatly assist in defence, overreliance on them
   often leads to defeat. Turrets, for example, don't react fast enough to
   harm an experienced Ranger. All Deployables drain a lot of energy, so
   each team has to balance the amount of Deployables and energy gained by
   the Generators held by them.
