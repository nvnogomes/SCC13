   The Eglinton Tournament Bridge is a [18]bridge located within
   [19]Eglinton Country Park near [20]Kilwinning, [21]North Ayrshire,
   [22]Scotland. The bridge crosses the [23]Lugton Water a short distance
   northwest of [24]Eglinton Castle (OS ref: [25]NS32064224) and was named
   after the [26]Eglinton Tournament of 1839. The castle and surrounding
   grounds were once home to the Montgomerie family, [27]Earls of Eglinton
   and chiefs of the [28]Clan Montgomery.

[[46]edit] The Tournament Bridges

   The surviving 'Tournament Bridge' was built to provide an appropriate
   crossing point to gain access to the far side of the [47]Lugton Water.
   [48]Archibald Montgomerie, the 13th [49]Earl of Eglinton had the bridge
   built in a [50]Gothic style, using cast iron for the arches, pinnacles,
   etc. and stone for the two pairs of miniature ornamental towers at
   either end. These towers have subtle design differences (See
   photographs) which are significant in the context of the extended
   history of the bridge. This 'Tournament' bridge is said to have been
   designed by the architect [51]David Hamilton, however agreement to
   build the bridge was reached on 16 October 1799 and his first recorded
   work dates from 1807. An Adam Russell is recorded as being partner to
   the agreement.^[52][2]

   The bridge's cast iron [53]parapet is a repetition of the pointed
   Gothic arch design of the castle, surmounted by a battlement, and
   relieved in the centre with foliated [54]pinnacles.^[55][3] The
   Tournament Bridge is B listed by [56]Historic Scotland.^[57][4]

     The original Tournament Bridge and the procession in 1839. Note the
     three cast iron arches, crossed finials, pinnacles, and the taller,
         broader towers, etc. characteristic of that bridge.^[58][5]

   Eglinton Tournament. Note the lakes either side of the bridge^[59][6],
                         formed around 1800.^[60][7]

   The [61]1839 Eglinton Tournament was held on a meadow or holm at a loop
   in the Lugton Water. Most of the holm no longer exists, the excavations
   in this area having provided gravel and sand for the construction of
   the Kilwinning bypass and leaving behind an excavation pit which is now
   known as Eglinton Loch. The Knights on horseback and their retinue
   reached the [62]tilt yard ('C' on the map) via an enclosed ride ('G' on
   the map), whilst the guests and visitors made their way to the stands
   via the route marked 'F' on the map illustrated. Both groups crossed
   over the previous three arched Gothic bridge. A map of 1837 of Eglinton
   Castle, Grounds and Tilt yard of 1837 shows that the tilt yard was
   already in extistence at this early date, but it is not recorded what
   its fate was after the tournament was over.^[63][8]

                  The castle and Tournament Bridge in 1884.

   The 'new' Tournament Bridge served as a well used route across the
   Lugton Water, running through the deer park to the Eglinton kennels
   (previously Laigh Moncur), especially on days when the Eglinton Hunt
   met at the castle itself. It was built by Messrs Connell of Dalgarven,
   using parts of the original bridge and possibly to a design by David
   Hamilton..^[64][9] Messrs. Connell also built the new Kilwinning Tower
   to a design by David Hamilton.^[65][9]

    The 'old' Tournament Bridge converted artificially to two arches, etc
                               for comparison.

   The original bridge, also with two miniature towers, but with three
   arches and four pinnacles, stood roughly 100 yards further up the river
   towards the castle. The original bridge is shown in several
   contemporary prints and maps as illustrated in the appropriate gallery
   of this article.^[66][10]^[67][11] It was this bridge that was used at
   the Eglinton Tournament as can be seen from the illustrations of the
   event, however the name was passed on to the 'new' bridge constructed
   downstream of it. No clear sign of this three arched bridge remains, a
   weir having been built at its old position; the 'old' bridge was
   constructed in 1811^[68][12]^[69][13], therefore around the time of the
   'new' castle being built in 1801/2 and also when the grounds were being
   laid out by Tweedie.

   Surviving architects drawings show the designs for a three arched
   bridge and as stated, contemporary prints of the Eglinton Tournament
   also show a three arched Tournament bridge, with cast iron arches,
   pinnacles and parapets which may have been re-used in the later 'new'
   bridge which survives today.

   The point at which the 'old' bridge crossed the Lugton was 102 feet
   broad and 100 yards downriver from the castle.^[70][14] It had the
   Montgomerie coat of arms in the centre. Aiton describes it as being
   under construction in 1811.^[71][15] The miniature castle towers on the
   demolished bridge are shown as each being surmounted by a double cross,
   but these do not figure on the 'new' Tournament Bridge; the 'old'
   bridge therefore may have been specially embellished for the tournament
   with temporary additions.

     A view of the Tournament Bridge at its 'new' site. The level of the
      weir was lower at this time and was raised at a later date using
          randomly chosen stones to raise the water level.^[72][16]

     The Lord of the Tournament (Earl of Eglinton) and his esquires and
                   retainers crossing the bridge.^[73][17]

   A local minister, the Rev. Lee Ker, confirms which bridge was used at
   the tournament by relating in his book on [74]Kilwinning that the
   tournament procession passed over the Water of Lugton by what is now
   called the Tournament Bridge, but which was then situated about 100
   yards nearer the Castle and had three arches instead of two.^[75][18]
   This distance coincides with a weir today and an old path from the
   castle leads directly to it. Dane Love states that the bridge used by
   the tournament had been built by the 12th Earl in 1811.^[76][19] In
   contemporary reports of the tournament no special mention of the bridge
   is made, suggesting that it was already a well established feature of
   the estate by that time and not an extravagant new feature specially
   built for the event.

   Lauchlan^[77][20] confuses the issue by stating that an older bridge
   with three arches existed 100 yards up from the present one, however he
   states that the present bridge was built for the tournament. The old
   three arched bridge in fact still existed in 1840^[78][21] and at least
   as late as 1843.^[79][22]

[[80]edit] Construction of the 'new' Tournament Bridge

   The new bridge may have been erected by the 13th Earl at some time
   between 1843 and 1856 as part of the total re-modelling of the course
   of the Lugton Water which had been first undertaken by the 12th Earl
   (1740 - 1819)^[81][23] and which included the alteration of its course,
   the removal of the lakes or ponds and the creation of several weirs.
   The Lugton Water is liable to severe floods^[82][24] and damage to the
   easily broken cast iron work by the force of the current, may have been
   a reason for its reconstruction at a different site; a severe 'Great
   Storm' in Ayrshire is recorded as having damaged or destroyed several
   buildings and structures in February 1856.^[83][25] The first
   [84]Ordnance Survey map of 1856 shows the two arched bridge in
   position, a weir at the position of the old bridge and by this time the
   old lake had gone, replaced by a canalised Lugton Water with several
   weirs.
   [85]Robertosn's Map of the 1820s showing a lochan at Eglinton Castle.

   Ironically the strengthening work done on the 'new' bridge to produce
   an extra arch of bricks in addition to the cast iron, may have weakened
   the structure, contributing to its eventual partial collapse.^[86][26]
   The army used the bridge extensively with large lorries and even tanks
   crossing over it.

   The lower courses of ashlar^[87][27] on the bridge abutments and
   central pier were vermiculate.^[88][28] At some point the height of the
   weir beneath had been raised using an odd assortment of re-used
   stonework; this would have increased the depth and extent of the waters
   behind it. The central pier and the original weir had used reworked but
   re-cycled stone, probably from Kilwinning Abbey; as illustrated by a
   stone window surround recovered during restoration work (See
   illustration).

   Examination of the top of the outer towers shows that something was
   attached to the centres, the 'plug' hole still being present. It is
   possible that the holes are related to the method of lifting them into
   position during construction work. The larger towers are capped with
   cement and nothing is therefore visible. During restoration work (2008)
   electricity power cables or possibly gas pipes were located leading to
   the bridge and they may have served some form of lighting on the
   bridge.^[89][29] These are not visible in the available illustrations.
   The [90]Eglinton estate had its own gasworks and later its own power
   station, so it would have been natural to provide lighting on the
   bridge. The old [91]OS maps show that by 1897 the gas works had been
   established here to supply the castle and offices, whilst by 1911 this
   had been replaced by an electricity works; the present day park
   workshop.

                  Numbering on the cast iron arch sections.

   The larger and taller inner towers have been re-used from the older
   bridge, this being confirmed by the presence of ornate carving as
   infill within one of the larger towers. The curtain walls and the
   smaller and lower outer towers are made from a different type of stone
   and, as stated, the towers have a number of architectural differences,
   suggesting that they were made specifically for the 'new' Tournament
   Bridge (See photographs). During work on the central pier it was found
   that some of the hidden infill work is vermiculate ashlar from the
   'old' bridge.

   The cast iron sections of the arches are numbered and some of the
   sequence are absent, suggesting that these missing sections may have
   been damaged previously beyond repair and were not used therefore in
   the 'new' bridge.

[[97]edit] The Tournament Bridge and WWII

   The Eglinton Castle Estate was requisitioned during [98]World War II
   and during this occupation the Tournament Bridge partly collapsed,
   partly due to alterations which had been made earlier by the Eglinton
   Estate, involving supposed strengthening using brickwork, as revealed
   during the 2008 restoration work.^[99][31] The bridge was never
   designed to take the heavy army lorries and tanks which used the bridge
   during the army occupation of the site and this led to a partial
   collapse in the 1940s or possibly prior to WWII, around the year 1936.

   To save the bridge from total collapse the army [100]Royal Engineers
   Regiment removed the cast iron outer facia coverings and the pinnacles,
   encasing the remaining cast iron arches in concrete as can be seen from
   contemporary photographs and as further revealed during restoration
   work. It is not known what happened to the pinnacles and cast iron
   coverings. It had been thought that they were safely in storage,
   however enquiries have led to nothing.^[101][31]

    the Lugton Water to the castle in what became part of the deer park.

   John Ainslie's 1790 map showing pleasure garden on the opposite side of
    the Lugton Water to the castle in what became part of the deer park.

   Originally the river would have been crossed by simple fords, however
   by the 18th century ornamental pleasure gardens had been formed and
   these were partly situated in what later became the deer park. No signs
   of these gardens are now visible, apart from [104]Crop marks on aerial
   photographs taken around the end of the Second World War. A bridge was
   necessary to give access to the ornamental gardens and one is indicated
   on John Ainslie's map dated 1790, crossing the Lugton Water close to
   the castle itself. A small wooden bridge across the Lugton Water is
   shown in an illustration from around 1815, however this may not have
   been across the Lugton Water. Thomson's map of 1828 (See illustration)
   indicates a bridge crossing the Lugton Water at the castle where the
   three arched bridge was and a drive starting off at the position of the
   present day bridge, which may have been a ford at the time. Another
   bridge is suggested further upstream and close to the castle.^[105][32]

   A wooden 'Laundry Bridge' stood close to the castle and downstream from
   it was second wooden bridge which was washed away in a storm in 1938.
   Local children used it to build rafts. An 1807 estate map shows a
   bridge cutting across to a larder and another bridge just downstream,
   linked to the network of formal paths.^[106][10]

   the castle, roughly where Thomson also shows a bridge in his 1828 map.

   bridge. Here a drive and a possible building are located at the site of
                   the 'new' Tournament Bridge.^[108][32]

   The restored Stables Bridge, also called Lady Jane's Bridge, lies on
   the Kilwinning Lodge drive and just downstream from it stood an elegant
   cast-iron bridge with a 50 foot span.^[109][14] This cast iron bridge
   had high quality stonework on both of the abutments, much of which
   survives. This bridge gave access to the kitchen walled gardens and
   glasshouse ranges and lasted into the mid 1940s when the army removed
   it.

   The Suspension Bridge built by the army in the 1980s on behalf of the
   country park lies just below the weir beside the ruined gazebo. Lady
   Jane's cottage had a wooded pedestrian footbridge of which no sign
   remains.

   The restored Diamond Bridge lies upstream near the Eglinton Loch and
   continues to give access to the old Toll Road from Irvine to Kilwinning
   via [110]Fergushill. This bridge was named after the nearby Black
   Diamond mine, the spoil heap or bing of which still remains rear the
   Chapelholm Gate. The colliery name in turn was associated with one of
   the 13th Earl's favourite horses, Black Diamond.

      The Weir on the Lugton Water at the site of the old three arched
                             Tournament Bridge.

   The [114]Lugton Water was diverted and altered several times, for
   example in the 1790s its course was altered by the 12th Earl (1740 -
   1819)^[115][34] to run behind the Garden Cottage, rather than in front
   of it. The width was also changed at times, for instance five ponds or
   lakes were created by large weirs at one stage; the one at the
   Tournament Bridge is clearly visible in older prints of the 1840s (see
   illustrations) shown.^[116][35]

   The size, shape and position of the various weirs was altered several
   times, latterly by Clement Wilson of the canning factory. One of the
   weirs lies directly beneath the restored Tournament Bridge. The one
   below the site of the old [117]Bowling Green and [118]Robert Burns's
   garden was 'U' shaped, holding back sufficient water at one time to
   form a lake with a small island bearing a single [119]yew tree. The
   1938 [120]OS map shows no fewer than seven weirs between the castle and
   the present day Suspension Bridge.

   In 1948 the Trustees of the late 16th Earl sold most of the remaining
   parts of the estate to Robert Howie and Sons of [122]Dunlop for
   24,000^[123][36]^[124][37] and in the 1950s the Wilson family purchased
   the Tournament Bridge, old offices, castle ruins, and other land from
   Robert Howie and Sons.

   Clement Wilson, the food processing factory owner, established the
   Clement Wilson Foundation which opened part of the grounds to the
   public, spending around 400,000 (around 4,317,000 in 2008 terms) on
   partially restoring the Tournament Bridge, consolidating the castle
   ruins, planting trees, landscaping, making paths, creating a rockery
   and waterfall feature, etc.^[125][38]

[[126]edit] 2008 restoration

    The bridge partially dismantled and half way through hydrodemolition
                       during renovation in May 2008.

   The restoration of the Tournament Bridge involves a faithful and
   historic renovation of the Tournament Bridge, based on surviving
   documentary evidence. [127]Historic Scotland requires a faithful
   restoration where all details are replicated as closely as possible in
   terms of material, design and construction.

               Close up of a repair to the cracked cast iron.

   The existing concrete arches are to be removed as is the infill above.
   The arches will be replaced with the existing refurbished cast iron
   arch sections and new cast iron fascia sections, which will restore the
   original width of the structure. A secondary stainless steel pedestrian
   parapet is to be provided immediately behind the ballustrading. The
   load bearing capacity of the bridge will be carried by a modern steel
   structure concealed beneath the deck surface which will be timber, as
   this was considered to be the original material.^[128][39]

   The current timber parapets will be replaced with cast iron sections to
   match the original items. All of the cast iron elements are to be
   fabricated and fitted by the Ballantine [129]Bo'ness Iron Company to
   restore the splendour of the original structure.^[130][40]

   The restoration involved [131]hydrodemolition to expose the cast iron
   arches through removing the concrete in which they had been embeded.
   This process used very high pressure water jets and confirmed the poor
   structural integrity of the iron arches. They were not however intended
   to be load bearing in the restored bridge and an upside was the degree
   of Gothic artwork found to exist on the arches.^[132][31]

   The estimated total project cost is 720k. Historic Scotland have
   indicated that they would be able to contribute some 161k, around 5k
   will be provided in kind, and the shortfall of 354k was the subject of
   the successful grant application to the [133]Heritage Lottery
   Fund.^[134][41]
