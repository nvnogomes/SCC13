Ed and Larry

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   [12]talk page for details. (February 2008)

   Ed and Larry are [13]fictional characters on the [14]television series
   [15]The West Wing, played by [16]Peter James Smith and [17]William
   Duffy. They are secondary characters, both of whom work in the
   [18]White House. Their most notable feature is that they are never seen
   apart from each other, in which respect they are similar to [19]Lenny
   Leonard and [20]Carl Carlson on [21]The Simpsons or [22]Rosencrantz and
   Guildenstern from [23]Hamlet. Larry is Caucasian and Ed is
   Asian-American.

   Their position within the White House is never made clear, although
   they often function in an operational role under [24]Josh Lyman. They
   have also been seen, however, attending [25]C.J. Cregg's staff
   meetings. Most likely, they work in the [26]Office of Management and
   Budget.

   Over the years, they have worked on a wide variety of projects: They
   briefed several senior staffers on the [27]India-[28]Pakistan conflict,
   using information they claimed to have taken from the [29]Encyclopdia
   Britannica. They once helped write jokes for one of [30]President
   Bartlet's speeches, contributing a joke that involved an impression of
   [31]John Wayne and a sock puppet.

   Very few fans of [32]The West Wing can tell the two apart, a fact which
   has been acknowledged onscreen by [33]C.J. Cregg, who admitted she
   could not tell the difference between them. Ed and Larry themselves
   have said that it doesn't matter. There are four points in the series
   at which the distinction can be properly deduced: in "[34]H. Con-172",
   the Caucasian member of Ed and Larry mentions that he is Larry and the
   other is Ed, although the lighthearted nature of the scene could
   indicate they were joking so as to confuse [35]Sam Seaborn. In "[36]20
   Hours in America, Part I", during one of the President's daily
   briefings, the Caucasian appears alongside Sam to staff the President
   during the meeting. The President addresses him as Ed, and is corrected
   by the staffer, who claims to be Larry. In "[37]Angel Maintenance",
   President Bartlet directs Larry to talk to the press aboard Air Force
   One. The Caucasian acknowledges the order and turns to leave. And
   finally, in "[38]The Fall's Gonna Kill You", Ed and Larry catch Donna
   Moss in the hallway to read her a fax that they find hilarious. The
   Caucasian refers to the other as "Ed".

   In addition, neither of the characters' last names have been revealed.
   Their last names are conspicuously absent in the season 7 episode
   "[39]Here Today," when [40]Toby Ziegler writes down their full names
   instead of saying them aloud when the White House Counsel asks for
   them.

   In the credits for episodes where Ed and Larry appear, [41]Peter James
   Smith is credited as Ed and [42]William Duffy is credited as Larry. The
   final episode also features President Bartlet saying goodbye to each of
   them, along with many other White House staffers, and managing to get
   their names right.
