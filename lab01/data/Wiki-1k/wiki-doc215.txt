   The Doolittle Raid, 18 April 1942, was the first [48]air raid by the
   United States to strike a Japanese home island ([49]Honsh) during World
   War II. It demonstrated that Japan itself was vulnerable to [50]Allied
   air attack and provided an expedient means for U.S. retaliation for
   Japan's [51]attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December, 1941. The raid was
   planned and led by [52]Lieutenant Colonel [53]James "Jimmy" Doolittle.
   Doolittle would later recount in his autobiography that the raid was
   intended to cause the Japanese to doubt their leadership and to raise
   American morale:

     The Japanese had been told they were invulnerable. An attack on the
     Japanese homeland would cause confusion in the minds of the Japanese
     people and sow doubt about the reliability of their leaders.
     There was a second, equally important, psychological reason for this
     attack...Americans badly needed a morale boost.^[54][1]

   16 [55]B-25B Mitchell bombers were launched from the [56]aircraft
   carrier [57]USS Hornet deep within enemy waters. The plan called for
   them to hit military targets in Japan, and land in China. All 16
   aircraft were lost and 11 crewmen were either killed or captured. The
   crews of 14 aircraft, including one interned in the Soviet Union for
   more than a year, returned safely to the United States.^[58][2]^[59][3]

[[77]edit] Origins

   of a B-25 on the deck of the USS Hornet

   The raid had its start in a desire by President [78]Franklin D.
   Roosevelt, expressed to [79]Joint Chiefs of Staff in a meeting at the
   [80]White House on 21 December, 1941, that Japan be bombed as soon as
   possible to boost public morale after the disaster at Pearl
   Harbor.^[81][4]

   The concept for the attack came from Navy Captain Francis Low,
   Assistant Chief of Staff for [82]Anti-submarine Warfare, who reported
   to Admiral [83]Ernest J. King on 10 January, 1942, that he thought that
   twin-engined Army bombers could be successfully launched from an
   aircraft carrier after observing several at a naval airfield in
   [84]Norfolk, Virginia, where the runway was painted with the outline of
   a carrier deck for landing practice.^[85][5] It was subsequently
   planned and led by Doolittle, a famous civilian [86]aviator and
   [87]aeronautical engineer before the war.

   Requirements for the aircraft for a cruising range of 2,400 miles
   (3,900 km) with a 2,000 pound (900 kg) bomb load resulted in the
   selection of the [88]North American [89]B-25B Mitchell to carry out the
   mission. The [90]B-26 Marauder, [91]B-18 Bolo, and [92]B-23 Dragon were
   also considered,^[93][6] but the B-26 had questionable takeoff
   characteristics from a carrier deck, and the B-23's wingspan was nearly
   50% greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken
   aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's island. The B-18, one
   of the final two types considered by Doolittle, was rejected for the
   same reason.^[94][7]

   Subsequent tests with B-25s indicated they could fulfill the mission's
   requirements. Doolittle's first report on the plan suggested that the
   bombers might land in [95]Vladivostok, shortening the flight by
   600 miles (1,000 km), on the basis of turning over the B-25s as
   [96]Lend-Lease.^[97][8] However, negotiations with the Soviet Union
   (which was not at war with Japan) for permission were
   fruitless.^[98][9]

[[99]edit] Training

   Lt. Col. Doolittle wires a Japanese medal to a bomb, for "return" to
   its originators.

   When planning indicated that the B-25 was the aircraft best meeting all
   specifications of the mission, two were loaded aboard the aircraft
   carrier [100]USS Hornet at [101]Norfolk, Virginia, and subsequently
   flown off the deck without difficulty on 3 February, 1942.^[102][10]
   The raid was immediately approved and the 17th Bomb Group (Medium)
   chosen to provide the pool of crews from which volunteers would be
   recruited. The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with
   all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941.
   The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air
   Corps, but in the spring of 1942, also had the most experienced B-25
   crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States
   into the war was to the U.S. [103]Eighth Air Force.^[104][11]

   The 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [105]Pendleton,
   Oregon, was immediately moved cross-country to [106]Lexington County
   Army Air Base, [107]Columbia, South Carolina, ostensibly to fly similar
   patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to
   prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred
   to Columbia effective 9 February, where its combat crews were offered
   the opportunity to volunteer for an "extremely hazardous" but
   unspecified mission. On 17 February the group was detached from the
   Eighth Air Force.

   Initial planning called for 20 aircraft to fly the mission,^[108][12]
   and 24 of the group's B-25B Mitchell bombers were diverted to the
   [109]Mid-Continent Airlines modification center in [110]Minneapolis,
   Minnesota. Modifications included:
     * Removal of the lower gun turret
     * Installation of de-icers and anti-icers
     * Steel blast plates mounted on the fuselage around the upper turret
     * Removal of the liaison radio set
     * Installation of three additional fuel tanks and support mounts in
       the bomb bay, crawl way and lower turret area to increase fuel
       capacity from 646 to 1,141 [111]U.S. gallons (2,445 to 4,319
       [112]litres)
     * Mock gun barrels installed in the tail cone, and
     * Replacement of their [113]Norden bombsight with a makeshift aiming
       sight, devised by pilot Capt. C. Ross Greening and called the
       "[114]Mark Twain".^[115][13]

   Two bombers also had cameras mounted to record the results of
   bombing.^[116][9]

   The 24 crews selected picked up the modified bombers in Minneapolis and
   flew them to [117]Eglin Field, [118]Florida, beginning 1 March 1942.
   There the crews received intensive training for three weeks in
   simulated carrier deck takeoffs, low-level and night flying, low
   altitude bombing, and over water navigation. Lt. Col Doolittle stated
   in his after action report that an operational level of training was
   reached despite several days when flying was not possible because of
   rain and fog. One aircraft was heavily damaged in a takeoff accident
   and another taken off the mission because of a nose wheel shimmy that
   could not be repaired in time.^[119][9]

   On 25 March, the remaining 22 B-25s took off from Eglin for
   [120]McClellan Field, [121]California. They arrived on 27 March for
   final modifications at the Sacramento Air Depot. A total of 16 B-25s
   were subsequently flown to [122]Alameda, California, on 31 March.
   Fifteen raiders would be the mission force and a 16th aircraft, by last
   minute agreement with the Navy, would be squeezed onto the deck to be
   flown off shortly after departure from San Francisco to provide
   feedback to the Army pilots about takeoff characteristics. (The 16th
   bomber was made part of the mission force instead.)

[[141]edit] The Raid

   B-25Bs on USS Hornet en route to Japan

   On 1 April, the 16 modified bombers, their five-man crews and Army
   maintenance personnel, totalling 71 officers and 130 enlisted
   men,^[142][15] were loaded onto [143]USS Hornet at Alameda. Each
   aircraft carried four specially-constructed 500-pound (225 kg) bombs.
   Three of these were high-explosive munitions, and one was a bundle of
   incendiaries. The incendiaries were long tubes, wrapped together in
   order to be carried in the [144]bomb bay, but designed to separate and
   scatter over a wide area after release. Five of these bombs had
   Japanese "friendship" medals wired to them - medals awarded by the
   Japanese government to U.S. servicemen before the war.^[145][16] To
   decrease weight (and thus increase range), the bombers' armament was
   reduced. Each bomber launched with two [146].50-calibre (12.7 mm)
   machine guns in an upper turret and a [147].30-caliber (7.6 mm) machine
   gun in the nose. Two wooden, simulated gun barrels mounted in the tail
   cones were intended to discourage Japanese air attacks from that
   direction, and were cited afterward by Doolittle as being particularly
   effective.^[148][9] The aircraft were clustered closely and tied down
   on the Hornet's flight deck in the order of their expected launch.
   Orders in hand, Navy Capt. [149]Marc A. Mitscher, skipper of the USS
   Hornet chats with Lt. Col. James Doolittle.

   The Hornet and Task Force 18 left the port of Alameda at 10:00 on 2
   April and a few days later rendezvoused with Task Force 16, commanded
   by [150]Vice Admiral [151]William F. Halsey, Jr.: the carrier
   [152]USS Enterprise and its escort of [153]cruisers and [154]destroyers
   in the mid-Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii. The Enterprise's fighters and
   scout planes would provide protection for the entire task force in the
   event of a Japanese air attack, since the Hornet's fighters were stowed
   below decks to allow the B-25s to use the flight deck. The combined
   force, two carriers, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, eight
   destroyers, and two fleet oilers,^[155][17] then proceeded in radio
   silence. On the afternoon of April 17, the slow oilers refueled the
   task force, then withdrew with the destroyers to the east, while the
   carriers and cruisers dashed west at 20 knots towards their intended
   launch point in enemy-controlled waters east of Japan.^[156][18]

   At 07:38 on the morning of 18 April, while the task force was still
   about 650 miles (1,050 km) from Japan, it was sighted by Japanese
   picket boat No. 23 Nitto Maru which radioed an attack warning to
   Japan.^[157][19] Although the boat was fatally damaged by gunfire from
   the cruiser [158]USS Nashville,^[159][20] Doolittle and Hornet skipper
   Captain [160]Marc Mitscher decided to launch the B-25s immediately10
   hours early and 170 miles (270 km) farther from Japan than planned.
   After respotting to allow for engine start and run-ups, Doolittle's
   aircraft had 467 ft (142 metres) of takeoff distance.^[161][21] Despite
   the fact that none of the B-25 pilots, including Doolittle, had ever
   taken off from a carrier before, all 16 aircraft launched safely
   between 08:20 and 09:19. (The 16th B-25 had been included only as a
   reserve, intended to fly along as an observation and photographic
   platform, but when the mission was compromised, Doolittle made a
   command decision to utilize the reserve aircraft.)^[162][22] This was
   the only time that [163]United States Army Air Forces bombers were
   launched from a [164]U.S. Navy aircraft carrier on a combat mission.

   The B-25s then flew towards Japan, most in groups of two to four
   aircraft before changing to single-file at wavetop level to avoid
   detection.^[165][23] The aircraft began arriving over Japan about noon
   (Tokyo time; six hours after launch) and bombed 10 military and
   industrial targets in Tokyo, two in [166]Yokohama, and one each in
   [167]Yokosuka, [168]Nagoya, [169]Kobe and [170]Osaka. Although some
   B-25s encountered light anti-aircraft fire and a few enemy fighters
   over Japan, no bomber was shot down. Only the B-25 of Lt. Richard O.
   Joyce received any battle damage, minor hits from anti-aircraft
   fire.^[171][24] Plane No. 4, piloted by Lt. Everett W. Holstrom,
   jettisoned its bombs before reaching its target when it came under
   attack by fighters after its gun turret malfunctioned.^[172][25]

   15 of the 16 aircraft then proceeded southwest along the southern coast
   of Japan and across the [173]East China Sea towards eastern China,
   where several fields in Chekiang (now [174]Zhejiang) Province were
   supposed to be ready to guide them in using homing beacons, then
   recover and refuel them for continuing on to Chungking.^[175][26] One
   B-25, extremely low on fuel, headed instead for the closer land mass of
   Russia.

   The raiders faced several unforeseen challenges during their flight to
   China: night was approaching, the aircraft were running low on fuel,
   and the weather was rapidly deteriorating. None would have reached
   China at all except for a fortuitous tail wind as they came off the
   target that increased their ground speed by 25 knots for seven
   hours.^[176][27] As a result of these problems, the crews realized they
   would probably not be able to reach their intended bases in China,
   leaving them the option of either bailing out over eastern China or
   crash landing along the Chinese coast.^[177][9]^[178][28] Fifteen
   aircraft reached the Chinese coast after 13 hours of flight and crash
   landed or bailed out; the crew who flew to Russia landed 40 miles
   (65 km) beyond [179]Vladivostok, where their B-25 was confiscated and
   the crew interned until they managed to escape through [180]Iran in
   1943.^[181][2]^[182][29] It was the longest combat mission ever flown
   by the [183]B-25 Mitchell medium bomber, averaging approximately 2,250
   miles (3,600 km).

   Doolittle and his crew, after safely parachuting into China, received
   assistance from Chinese soldiers and civilians as well as [184]John
   Birch, an American [185]missionary in China. As did the others who
   participated in the mission, Doolittle had to bail out but fortunately
   landed in a heap of dung (saving a previously injured ankle from
   breaking) in a rice paddy in China near Chuchow ([186]Quzhou).
   Doolittle thought that the raid had been a terrible failure because the
   aircraft were lost, and that he would be court-martialed upon his
   return. Doolittle subsequently recommended Birch for intelligence work
   with [187]General Chennault's [188]Flying Tigers.

[[189]edit] Aftermath

[[190]edit] Fate of the missing crewmen

   Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle (center) with members of his flight crew
   and Chinese officials in China after the attack. Lt. Richard Cole, to
   Doolittle's immediate right, attended the 2008 Raider Reunion.

   Following the Doolittle Raid, most of the B-25 crews that came down in
   China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians
   and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly
   for sheltering the Americans. The Japanese military began the
   [191]Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign to intimidate the Chinese from helping
   downed American airmen. The Japanese killed an estimated 250,000
   civilians while searching for Doolittle's men.^[192][30] The crews of
   two aircraft (10 men in total) were unaccounted for; Hallmark's crew
   (sixth off) and Farrow's crew (last off). On 15 August 1942, the United
   States learned from the [193]Swiss [194]Consulate General in Shanghai
   that eight of the missing crew members were prisoners of the Japanese
   at Police Headquarters in that city (two crewmen had died in the crash
   landing of their aircraft). On 19 October 1942, the Japanese announced
   that they had tried the eight men and sentenced them to death, but that
   several of them had received commutation of their sentences to life
   imprisonment. No names or details were included in the broadcast.
   Japanese propaganda ridiculed the raid, calling it the "Do-nothing
   Raid", and boasted that several B-25s had been shot down. In fact, none
   had been lost to hostile action.

   After the war, the complete story of the two missing crews was
   uncovered in a [195]war crimes trial held in Shanghai. The trial opened
   in February 1946 to try four Japanese officers for mistreatment of the
   eight captured crewmen. Two of the missing crewmen, Sgt. William J.
   Dieter and Cpl. Donald E. Fitzmaurice, had died when their B-25 crashed
   off the coast of China. The other eight, Lieutenants Dean E. Hallmark,
   [196]Robert J. Meder, [197]Chase J. Nielsen, William G. Farrow, Robert
   L. Hite, and George Barr; and Corporals Harold A. Spatz and [198]Jacob
   DeShazer were captured. In addition to being tortured and starved,
   these men contracted [199]dysentery and [200]beriberi as a result of
   the poor conditions under which they were confined. On 28 August 1942,
   pilot Hallmark, pilot Farrow and gunner Spatz were given a [201]mock
   trial by the Japanese, although the airmen were never told the charges
   against them. On 14 October 1942, these three crewmen were advised that
   they were to be executed the next day. At 16:30 on 15 October 1942, the
   three were taken by truck to Public Cemetery Number 1 outside of
   Shanghai and put before a firing squad.

   The other five captured airmen remained in military confinement on a
   starvation diet, their health rapidly deteriorating. In April 1943,
   they were moved to [202]Nanking where, on 1 December 1943, Meder died.
   The remaining four men (Nielsen, Hite, Barr and DeShazer) eventually
   began receiving slightly better treatment from their captors and were
   even given a copy of the [203]Bible and a few other books. They
   survived until they were freed by American troops in August 1945. The
   four Japanese officers who were tried for war crimes against the eight
   Doolittle Raiders were all found guilty. Three of them were sentenced
   to hard labor for five years and the fourth to a nine-year sentence.
   DeShazer eventually became a missionary and returned to Japan in 1948,
   where he served in that capacity for over 30 years.

   Of the group, only Hite was still alive as of 2008. Barr died of heart
   failure in 1967, Nielsen in 2007 and [204]Jacob DeShazer died 15 March
   2008.

   One other Doolittle Raid crewman was lost on the mission. Corporal
   Leland D. Faktor (flight engineer/gunner with Gray) was killed during
   his bailout attempt over China, the only man on his crew to be lost.

[[205]edit] Service of the returning crewmen

   Immediately following the raid, Doolittle told his crew that he
   believed the loss of all 16 aircraft, coupled with the relatively minor
   damage the aircraft had inflicted on their targets, had rendered the
   attack a failure, and that he expected a [206]court martial upon his
   return to the United States. Instead, the raid bolstered American
   morale to such an extent that Doolittle was awarded the [207]Medal of
   Honor by [208]President [209]Roosevelt, and was promoted two grades to
   [210]Brigadier General, skipping the rank of colonel. He went on to
   command the [211]Twelfth Air Force in North Africa, the [212]Fifteenth
   Air Force in the Mediterranean, and the [213]Eighth Air Force in
   England during the next three years.

   In addition to Doolittle's award of the Medal of Honor, Corporal David
   J. Thatcher (a flight engineer/gunner on Lawson's crew) and 1st Lt.
   Thomas R. White (flight surgeon/gunner with Smith) each received the
   [214]Silver Star for their efforts in helping the wounded crew members
   of Lt. Lawson's crew evade Japanese troops in China. All 80 Raiders
   received the [215]Distinguished Flying Cross and those who were killed,
   wounded or injured as a result of the raid also received the
   [216]Purple Heart. In addition, every Doolittle Raider received a
   decoration from the Chinese government.

   Twenty-eight of the crewmen remained in the [217]China Burma India
   theater flying missions, most for more than a year. Five were
   [218]killed in action. Nineteen crew members flew combat missions from
   North Africa after returning to the United States, with four killed in
   action and four becoming [219]prisoners of war. Nine crew members
   served in the [220]European Theater of Operations, one killed in
   action. Altogether 12 of the survivors died in air crashes within 15
   months of the raid. Two survivors were separated from the USAAF in 1944
   due to the severity of their injuries.^[221][2]

   The 17th Bomb Group, from which the Doolittle Raiders had been
   recruited, received replacement crews and transferred to [222]Barksdale
   Army Air Field in June 1942, where it converted to [223]B-26 Marauder
   medium bombers. In November 1942 it deployed overseas to North Africa,
   where it operated in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with the
   [224]Twelfth Air Force for the remainder of the war.

[[225]edit] Impact

   Compared to the devastating [226]B-29 Superfortress attacks against
   Japan later in the war, the Doolittle raid did little material damage.
   Eight primary and five secondary targets were struck, and the Japanese
   reported that the two planes whose crews were captured had also struck
   their targets. At least one bomb from the plane of Lt. Edgar E. McElroy
   struck the [227]Japanese aircraft carrier Ryh.^[228][31] Nevertheless,
   when the news of the raid was released, American morale soared.
   Stinging from the attack on Pearl Harbor and Japan's subsequent
   territorial gains, it was important for the American public to know
   that a successful military response had been undertaken.^[229][32]

   The raid also had a strategic impact, though it was not understood at
   the time, in that it caused the Japanese to recall some fighter units
   back to the home islands for defense. The Japanese Navy also bore a
   special responsibility for the fact that an American carrier task force
   had approached the Japanese Home Islands in a manner similar to that on
   Pearl Harbor, and then escaped unpunished.^[230][33] The fact that
   land-based bombers carried out the attack served to confuse Japanese
   war planners about the source of the attack. This confusion and an
   assumption that Japan was vulnerable to air attack strengthened
   [231]Admiral Yamamoto's resolve to seize Midway Island, resulting in
   the decisive [232]Battle of Midway^[233][34]^[234][35]

     It was hoped that the damage done would be both material and
     psychological. Material damage was to be the destruction of specific
     targets with ensuing confusion and retardation of production. The
     psychological results, it was hoped, would be the recalling of
     combat equipment from other theaters for home defense thus effecting
     relief in those theaters, the development of a fear complex in
     Japan, improved relationships with our Allies, and a favorable
     reaction on the American people.Gen. James H. Doolittle, 9 July
     1942^[235][9]^[236][36]

   WWII Army vet George A. McCalpin (right) speaking with Lt. Col. Richard
   E. Cole (seated) about McCalpin's cousin, Raider Sgt. William 'Billy
   Jack' Dieter, at the 66th anniversary event at the University of Texas
   at Dallas in April 2008.

   The Doolittle Raiders have held an annual reunion almost every year
   since the late 1940s. The high point of each reunion is a solemn,
   private ceremony in which the surviving Raiders perform a roll call,
   then toast their fellow Raiders who passed away during the previous
   year. Specially-engraved silver goblets, one for each of the 80
   Raiders, are used for this toast. The goblets of those who have died
   are inverted. When only two Raiders remain alive, they will drink a
   final toast using the vintage 1896 bottle of [238]Hennessy [239]cognac
   which has accompanied the goblets to each Raider reunion since 1960.
   The vintage was chosen because it was the year of Jimmy Doolittle's
   birth. The bottle of cognac and the goblets had been maintained by the
   [240]United States Air Force Academy on display in Arnold Hall, the
   cadet social center. On 19 April 2006, the memorabilia were transferred
   to the [241]National Museum of the United States Air Force.^[242][37]

   As of 2008, only nine Raiders are still alive.^[243][38] Only eight
   were able to attend the 64th anniversary reunion held in [244]Dayton,
   Ohio, in April 2006. Seven were able to attend the 65th anniversary in
   April 2007 in [245]San Antonio, [246]Texas. Six of the Raiders were
   able to attend the 66th anniversary in April 2008 in [247]Dallas,
   Texas:
     * Col. William M. Bower, pilot of aircraft #12
     * Lt. Col. Richard E. Cole, copilot of aircraft #1
     * Maj. Thomas C. Griffin, navigator of aircraft #9
     * M/Sgt. Edwin W. Horton, gunner of aircraft #10
     * S/Sgt. David J. Thatcher, gunner of aircraft #7
     * Lt. Col. Robert L. Hite, copilot of aircraft #16

[[248]edit] Legacy

   The United States Navy named one of its aircraft carriers after the
   fictional location, [249]USS Shangri-La, as an obvious reference to the
   Doolittle Raid. The name referred to the recently lost [250]USS Hornet.
   President Roosevelt had answered a reporter's question by saying that
   the raid had come from "[251]Shangri-La", which was the name of the
   mysterious place of perpetual youth in the [252]Himalayas in the
   popular book and movie of the time, [253]Lost
   Horizon.^[254][39]^[255][40]

[[256]edit] Doolittle Raiders exhibit

   [257]NMUSAF Doolittle Raid exhibit

   The most extensive display of Doolittle Raid memorabilia can be seen at
   the [258]National Museum of the United States Air Force (on
   [259]Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) in [260]Dayton, Ohio. The
   centerpiece is a like-new [261]B-25, which is painted and marked as
   Doolittle's aircraft (although it is actually a F-10D (photo reconn
   version of the B-25D)). The bomber, which [262]North American Aviation
   presented to the Raiders in 1958, rests on a reproduction of the USS
   Hornet's flight deck. The scene is made even more realistic through the
   use of several authentically-dressed mannequins surrounding the
   aircraft; these include representations of Doolittle, USS Hornet
   skipper Captain [263]Marc Mitscher, and groups of Army and Navy
   personnel loading the aircraft's bombs and ammunition. Other highlights
   of the exhibit are the silver goblets used by the Raiders at each of
   their annual reunions; pieces of flight clothing and personal
   equipment; a parachute used by one of the Raiders in his bailout over
   China; and group photographs of all 16 crews. Many other interesting
   items are also included in this unique collection.
   Raiders' goblets

   A fragment of the wreckage of one of the aircraft as well as the medals
   awarded to Doolittle are on display at the [264]Smithsonian National
   Air and Space Museum in [265]Washington, D.C.

   The recently-opened [266]Pacific Aviation Museum on [267]Ford Island,
   [268]Oahu, Hawaii also features a 1942 exhibit in which the centerpiece
   is a restored B-25 in the markings of "[269]The Ruptured Duck" used on
   the Doolittle Raid.^[270][41]

   The San Marcos, Texas chapter of the Commemorative Air Force has the
   actual armor plate from the pilot seat of the B-25 Colonel Doolittle
   flew in the raid in their museum.

[[271]edit] Doolittle Raiders re-creation

   The restored World War II B-25 Mitchell bomber aircraft "Heavenly Body"
   takes off from the deck of Ranger.

   On 21 April 1992, in harmony with other World War II 50th Anniversary
   festivities, [272]USS Ranger participated in the commemorative
   re-enactment of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, Japan.

   Two World War II-era B-25 bombers were craned on board and over 1,500
   guests (including national, local and military media) were embarked to
   witness the two vintage warbirds thunder down Ranger's flight deck and
   take off.

[[273]edit] Popular culture

   The Doolittle Raid was the subject of the 1944 feature film,
   [274]Thirty Seconds over Tokyo. This was based on a book of the same
   title by Doolittle Raider pilot Captain [275]Ted W. Lawson, who lost a
   leg and had other serious injuries as a result of a crash landing off
   the coast of China. [276]Spencer Tracy played Doolittle and [277]Van
   Johnson portrayed Lawson. The movie is considered to be a reasonably
   accurate and unsensationalized depiction of the mission. The movie has
   the general approval of the Raiders (footage from the film was later
   used for the opening scenes of [278]Midway).

   The raid also inspired two other films. One was the 1943 [279]RKO film
   [280]Bombardier starring [281]Randolph Scott and [282]Pat O'Brien. The
   climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of [283]B-17s.
   The other film, [284]The Purple Heart, made in 1944, starring [285]Dana
   Andrews, was a fictional depiction based on a Japanese court martial of
   captured American airmen, from the Doolittle Raid.

   The 2001 film [286]Pearl Harbor presented a heavily fictionalized
   version of the raid, with the attack portrayed as having destroyed an
   entire industrial area against withering antiaircraft gunfire and with
   many other technical inaccuracies.

   A highly fictionalized film in 1943, [287]Destination Tokyo starring
   [288]Cary Grant, tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the
   fictional submarine [289]USS Copperfin. The submarine's mission is to
   enter [290]Tokyo Bay undetected and place a landing party ashore to
   obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The
   film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data was
   received. However, all the after-action reports indicated the raid
   launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter
   with the picket ships.^[291][9]

   Many books were written about the Doolittle Raid after the war.
   Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders, by C.V. Glines, tells the complete story of
   the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. Guests of
   the Kremlin, written by copilot Bob Emmens, describes his crew's
   adventures as internees in Russia after their landing in that country
   following the raid. Four Came Home, also by C.V. Glines, tells the
   story of Nielsen, Hite, Barr, and DeShazer, the Raiders who were held
   in [292]POW camps for over three years. The First Heroes, by Craig
   Nelson, goes into great detail of the events leading up to the raid and
   the aftermath for all the pilots and their families.

   A related VHS video with contemporary footage of Doolittle and the
   flight preparations, along with the B-25s launching, is DeShazer, the
   story of missionary Sergeant [293]Jake DeShazer of B-25 #16 (the last
   to launch from the Hornet). The video is based on "The Amazing Story of
   Sergeant Jacob De Shazer: The Doolittle Raider Who Turned Missionary by
   C. Hoyt Watson. At the end of both the video and the book, DeShazer
   after the war meets [294]Mitsuo Fuchida, the commander and lead pilot
   of the Pearl Harbor attack.
