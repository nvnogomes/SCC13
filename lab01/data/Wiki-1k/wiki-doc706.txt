Earl of Breadalbane and Holland

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   The title Earl of [9]Breadalbane and Holland was created in the
   [10]Peerage of Scotland for John Campbell of Glenorchy, sometime Earl
   of Caithness.
   Campbell of Breadalbane.

   John Campbell of [11]Glenorchy, as a principal creditor, had 'acquired'
   the estates of [12]George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness who had died
   without issue in 1670. Campbell was consequently created [13]Earl of
   Caithness in 1673, but after much [14]litigation and even bloodshed,
   George Sinclair of [15]Keiss (d. 1698), second son of George, 5th Earl
   of Caithness (d. 1643), recovered the estates, and successfully
   petitioned parliament regarding the Earldom, which was removed from
   Campbell. Sinclair's title was finally restored to him in 1681.

   Deprived by parliament of the Caithness Earldom, John Campbell of
   Glenorchy was created Earl of [16]Breadalbane, Viscount of [17]Tay and
   [18]Pentland, Lord Glenorchy, [19]Benederaloch, Ormelie and [20]Wick on
   [21]June 28, [22]1677.

   The 4th Earl was created Marquess of Breadalbane in the [23]Peerage of
   the United Kingdom in 1831, but this title became extinct at the death
   of the 2nd Marquess (and 5th Earl). The Marquessate was created again
   for the 7th Earl, but became extinct at his death.

   The Earldom has been dormant since the death of the 10th Earl in 1995.

   [24]Huba Campbell (born 1945), a four times removed cousin from the
   10th earl, has petitioned the [25]Lord Lyon for recognition of his
   right to the [26]undifferenced arms. The claim is disputed between the
   Hungarian Campbells and a British aristocrat, Sir [27]Lachlan Campbell,
   a direct descendant of the first earl. The last is apparently unable to
   succeed because it is said that his line is illegitimate.

   The main seat of the Earls of Breadalbane and Holland from the early
   19th century was the vast [28]Taymouth Castle in Scotland, which was
   sold by the 9th Earl shortly after the end of the First World War.
