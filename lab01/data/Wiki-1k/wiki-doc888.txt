   About in 1875.

   Edmond Franois Valentin About (14 February 1828 16 January 1885), was a
   French novelist, publicist and [8]journalist.

[[13]edit] Life

   He was born at [14]Dieuze, in the [15]Moselle [16]dpartement in the
   [17]Lorraine region of France. In 1848 he entered the [18]cole Normale,
   taking second place in the annual competition for admission in which
   [19]Hippolyte Taine came first. Among his college contemporaries,
   besides Taine, were [20]Francisque Sarcey, [21]Challemel-Lacour and
   [22]Prevost-Paradol. Of them all, About was considered the most highly
   vitalized, exuberant, brilliant and "undisciplined". It is said that
   one of his schoolmasters told him "You will never be more than a little
   [23]Voltaire," and About's career did tend toward Voltaire-style witty
   satire and commentaries on contemporary issues.

   At the end of his college career, he joined the French school in
   [24]Athens, but claimed that he had never intended to follow the
   professorial career for which the cole Normale was a preparation, and
   in 1853 he returned to France and devoted himself to literature and
   journalism.

[[25]edit] Career

   He made his name as an entertaining anti-clerical writer. The satirical
   Le roi des montagnes (The King of the Mountains, 1856) is the
   best-known of his novels. In Greece, About had noticed that there was a
   curious understanding between the brigands and police: brigandage was
   becoming almost a safe and respectable industry. About pushed this idea
   to invent the story of a brigand chief who converts his business into a
   registered [26]joint stock company.

   His book on Greece, La Grce contemporaine (1855) was an immediate
   success. In Tolla (1855), About was charged with drawing too freely on
   an earlier Italian novel, Vittoria Savelli (1841). This aroused
   prejudice against him, and he was the object of numerous attacks. The
   Lettres d'un bon jeune homme, written to the [27]Figaro under the
   signature of "Valentin de Quevilly", provoked more animosities. During
   the next few years, he wrote novels, stories, a play (which failed), a
   book-pamphlet on the Roman question, many pamphlets on other subjects
   of the day, innumerable newspaper articles, some art criticisms,
   rejoinders to the attacks of his enemies, and popular manuals of
   political economy, L'A B C du travailleur (1868), Le progrs (1864). His
   more serious novels include Madelon (1863), L'Infme (1867), the three
   that form the trilogy of the Vieille Roche (1866), and [28]Le roman
   d'un brave homme (1880) a kind of counterblast to the view of the
   French workman presented in [29]Zola's Assommoir. He is best remembered
   as a farceur, for the books Le nez d'un notaire (1862); [30]Le roi des
   montagnes (1856); [31]L'homme l'oreille casse (1862); Trente et
   quarante (1858); Le cas de [32]M. Gurin (1862).

   About's attitude towards the empire was friendly but critical. He
   greeted the liberal ministry of [33]mile Ollivier at the beginning of
   1870 with delight, and welcomed the [34]Franco-Prussian War. But as a
   result of the war he lost his beloved home in [35]Alsace, which he had
   purchased in 1858 out of the fruits of his earlier literary successes.
   With the fall of the empire, he became a [36]republican, and threw
   himself into battle against conservative reactionaries. From 1872 to
   about 1877, his paper, the XIX^e Sicle (19^th Century), became a power
   in the land. His political career, however, failed to advance further.

   On 23 January 1884 he was elected a member of the [37]Acadmie franaise,
   but died before taking his seat.
