   Edema ([22]American English) or Oedema ([23]British English), formerly
   known as dropsy or hydropsy, is an abnormal accumulation of fluid
   beneath the skin, or in one or more cavities of the body. Generally,
   the amount of [24]interstitial fluid is determined by the balance of
   fluid [25]homeostasis, and increased secretion of fluid into the
   interstitium or impaired removal of this fluid may cause edema.

   Five factors can contribute to the formation of edema. It may be
   facilitated by increased [26]hydrostatic pressure or reduced
   [27]oncotic pressure within blood vessels, increased blood vessel wall
   permeability as in [28]inflammation, obstruction of fluid clearance via
   the [29]lymphatic or changes in the water retaining properties of the
   tissues themselves. Raised hydrostatic pressure often reflects
   retention of water and sodium by the kidney.^[30][1]

[[36]edit] Mechanism

   Generation of interstitial fluid is regulated by the forces of the
   [37]Starling equation.^[38][2] Hydrostatic pressure within blood
   vessels tends to cause water to filter out into the tissue. This leads
   to a difference in protein concentration between blood plasma and
   tissue. As a result the [39]oncotic pressure of the higher level of
   protein in the plasma tends to suck water back into the blood vessels
   from the tissue. It is often not appreciated that the Starling equation
   does not indicate a balance between these forces. The hydrostatic force
   must always win, and there must always be leakage of fluid out of the
   vessel because otherwise there can be no oncotic gradient. Starling's
   equation states that the rate of leakage of fluid is determined by the
   difference between the two forces and also by the permeability of the
   vessel wall to water, which determines the rate of flow for a given
   force imbalance. Most water leakage occurs in capillaries or post
   capillary [40]venules, which have a [41]semi-permeable membrane wall
   that allows water to pass more freely than protein. (The protein is
   said to be reflected and the efficiency of reflection is given by a
   reflection constant of up to 1.) If the gaps between the cells of the
   vessel wall open up then permeability to water is increased first, but
   as the gaps increase in size permeability to protein also increases
   with a fall in reflection coefficient.

   Changes in the variables in Starling's equation can contribute to the
   formation of edema either by an increase in hydrostatic pressure within
   the blood vessel, a decrease in the oncotic pressure within the blood
   vessel or an increase in vessel wall permeability. The latter has two
   effects. It allows water to flow more freely and it reduces the oncotic
   pressure difference by allowing protein to leave the vessel more
   easily.

   A rise in hydrostatic pressure occurs in cardiac failure. A fall in
   oncotic pressure occurs in nephrotic syndrome and liver failure. An
   increase in permeability occurs in inflammation. It is commonly taught
   that these facts explain the occurrence of edema in these conditions.
   However, it has been known since the 1950s that the situation is more
   complex and it is still far from completely understood^[42][3].

   The variation in hydrostatic pressure in the vessels in the feet as
   compared to the face is about a metre of water. In the case of human
   feet, the Starling forces are always a long way out of balance. In
   severe heart failure the change in central venous pressure is tiny in
   comparison and cannot explain why edema of the feet develops simply
   through an effect on capillary leakage. Three other factors may be
   involved. If the central venous pressure rises to equal that of the
   thoracic lymph duct then clearance of fluid from the tissue will be
   impeded (see below). That is to say the edema may actually be caused by
   a change in output of fluid from the tissue, as much as input to the
   tissue. Secondly, severe heart failure is one of the most exhausting
   conditions there is. The sufferers tend to spend what little effort
   they can make trying to breathe with edematous lungs. They tend to sit
   up to make breathing easier and their feet hang immobile on the floor.
   Immobility is perhaps the commonest of all causes of edema, because
   clearance of fluid via the lymphatics needs muscle action. Thirdly, in
   severe heart failure [43]endocrine and neural changes alter the way
   tissues are perfused in ways that are not fully understood.

   Although a low plasma oncotic pressure is widely cited for the edema of
   nephrotic syndrome, most physicians note that the edema may occur
   before there is any significant loss of protein in the urine or fall in
   plasma protein level. Fortunately there is another explanation
   available. Most forms of nephrotic syndrome are due to biochemical and
   structural changes in the basement membrane of capillaries in the
   kidney glomerulae, and these changes occur, if to a lesser degree, in
   the vessels of most other tissues of the body. Thus the resulting
   increase in permeability that leads to protein in the urine can explain
   the edema if all other vessels are more permeable as well.

   Abnormal removal of interstitial fluid is caused by failure of the
   [44]lymphatic system. This may be due to obstruction from, for example,
   pressure from a [45]cancer or enlarged [46]lymph nodes, destruction of
   lymph vessels by [47]radiotherapy, or infiltration of the lymphatics by
   infection (such as [48]elephantiasis). It is most commonly due to a
   failure of the pumping action of muscles due to immobility, most
   strikingly in conditions such as multiple sclerosis, or paraplegia.
   Lymphatic return of fluid is also dependent on a pumping action of
   structures known as lymph hearts. It has been suggested that the edema
   that occurs in some people following use of aspirin-like
   cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as ibuprofen or indomethacin may be due
   to inhibition of lymph heart action.

   In myxedema and a variety of other rarer conditions edema is due to an
   increased tendency of the tissue to hold water within its extracellular
   space. In myxedema this is because of an increase in hydrophilic
   carbohydrate-rich molecules (perhaps mostly hyaluronan) deposited in
   the tissue matrix. Edema forms more easily in dependent areas in the
   elderly (sitting in chairs at home or on aeroplanes) and this is not
   well understood. Estrogens alter body weight in part through changes in
   tissue water content. There may be a variety of poorly understood
   situations in which transfer of water from tissue matrix to lymphatics
   is impaired because of changes in the hydrophilicity of the tissue or
   failure of the 'wicking' function of terminal lymphatic capillaries.

[[49]edit] Organ-specific edema

   Edema will occur in specific organs as part of inflammation, as in
   pharyngitis, tendonitis or pancreatitis, for instance. Certain organs
   develop edema through tissue specific mechanisms. Examples of edema in
   specific organs:

          + [50]Cerebral edema is extracellular fluid accumulation in the
            brain. It can occur in toxic or abnormal metabolic states and
            conditions such as systemic lupus. It causes drowsiness or
            loss of consciousness.
          + Pulmonary edema occurs when the pressure in blood vessels in
            the lung is raised because of obstruction to removal of blood
            via the pulmonary veins. This is usually due to failure of the
            left ventricle of the heart. It can also occur in altitude
            sickness or on inhalation of toxic chemicals. Pulmonary edema
            produces shortness of breath. [51]Pleural effusions may occur
            when fluid also accumulates in the [52]pleural cavity.

          + Edema may also be found in the cornea of the eye with
            glaucoma, severe conjunctivitis or keratitis or after surgery.
            It may produce coloured haloes around bright lights.

   Causes of edema which are generalized to the whole body can cause edema
   in multiple organs and peripherally. For example, severe heart failure
   can cause pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, ascites and
   [53]peripheral edema, the last of which effects can also derive from
   less serious causes.^[54][4]

   Common appearances of [55]cutaneous edema are observed with
   [56]mosquito bites, bee stings ([57]wheal and flare), and skin contact
   with certain plants such as [58]Poison Ivy or [59]Western Poison
   Oak,^[60][5] the latter of which are termed [61]contact dermatitis.

[[62]edit] Edema in plants

   Edema in plants is the extended swelling in plant organs caused
   primarily by an excessive accumulation of water. This occurs since the
   cell walls are composed of flexible cellulose.
