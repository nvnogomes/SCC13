Whippletree (mechanism)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Double-tree)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   A set of whippletrees or leader-bars for the two leaders of a
   four-horse team.

   A whippletree (or whiffletree) is a mechanism to distribute force
   evenly through [9]linkages. It consists of a bar pivoted at or near the
   centre, with force applied from one direction to the [10]pivot, and
   from the other direction to the tips. Several whippletrees may be used
   in series to distribute the force further. Whippletrees may be used
   either in [11]compression or [12]tension.

[[20]edit] Draught whippletrees

   A single horse ploughing the whippletree is the horizontal wooden bar
   just in front of the plough.

   Whippletrees are used in tension to distribute forces from a point load
   to the traces of [21]draught animals (the [22]traces are the chains or
   straps on each side of the harness, on which the animal pulls). For
   these, the whippletree consists of a loose horizontal bar between the
   [23]draught animal and its load. The centre of the bar is connected to
   the load, and the traces attach to its ends. Whippletrees are used
   especially when pulling a dragged load such as a [24]plough,
   [25]harrow, log or [26]canal boat or for pulling a vehicle (by the
   leaders in a team with more than one row of animals).

   A [27]swingletree (or singletree) is a special kind of whippletree used
   for a [28]horse-drawn vehicle, and the term swingletree is sometimes
   used for draught whippletrees generally.

   A whippletree balances the pull from each side of the animal,
   preventing the load from tugging alternately on each side. It also
   keeps a point load from pulling the traces in onto the sides of the
   animal.

   If several animals are used abreast, further whippletrees may be used
   behind the first. Thus, with two animals, each will have its own
   whippletree, then a further whippletree will balance the loads from
   their two whippletrees this arrangement is sometimes known as a
   double-tree, or for the [29]leaders in a larger team, leader-bars. With
   three or more animals abreast, even more whippletrees are needed; some
   may be made asymmetrical to balance odd numbers of animals. Multiple
   whippletrees balance the pulls from the different animals, ensuring
   that each takes a fair share of the work.

[[30]edit] Other agricultural whippletrees

   Whippletrees may also be used in modern agriculture, for example to
   link several ganged agricultural implements such as [31]harrows,
   [32]mowers or [33]rollers to a [34]tractor. In this case the effect is
   to combine several small loads to a single load at the tractor hitch
   (the reverse of the use for draught animals).

[[35]edit] Windscreen (windshield) wipers

   A standard automobile [36]windscreen wiper uses whippletrees to
   distribute the force of the wiper arm evenly across the blade.

   A series of whippletrees are used in compression in a standard
   [37]windscreen wiper, to distribute the point force of the sprung wiper
   arm evenly along the wiper blade.

[[38]edit] Telescopes

   Some designs for large telescopes use whiffletrees, attributed to Grubb
   ^[39][1], to support the optical elements. The tree provides for
   distributed mechanical support, thereby reduces localised mechanical
   deflections, which in turn reduces optical distortion. Unlike the
   applications described above, which are two dimensional, these
   whiffletrees are 3D designs since the tree has to support a circular
   area. Other variants of the term are whiffle-tree and whiffle tree.
