   The Russian [10]nobility ([11]Russian: Dvoryanstvo) arose in the 14th
   century and essentially governed [12]Russia until the [13]October
   Revolution of 1917.

   The [14]Russian word for nobility, Dvoryanstvo (), derives from the
   Russian word dvor (), meaning the Court of a prince or duke ([15]kniaz)
   and later, of the [16]tsar. A noble was called dvoryanin (pl.
   dvoryane). As in other countries, nobility was a status, a social
   category, but not a [17]title.

   Nobility was transferred by inheritance or was bestowed by a [27]fount
   of honour.
     * Ancient nobilitywhich the descendants of [28]Rurik and
       [29]Gediminas and [30]boyars inherited: e.g., the [31]Galitzins,
       [32]Khilkovs, [33]Gorchakovs, and [34]Chelyadnins.
     * Titled nobilitythere were three titles:
          + Prince ([35]knyaz ): e.g., [36]Prince Potemkin or Prince
            [37]Felix Yusupov
          + Count (graf ): e.g., Count [38]Tolstoy
          + Baron (baron ): e.g., Baron [39]Pahlen
     * Hereditary nobility routinely inherited by heirs
     * Personal nobilitygranted for the personal merits of the recipient.
     * Unpropertied nobilitywas obtained without the allotment and
       securing of a [40]landed estate.

   Unlike the ancient nobility, which was exclusively hereditary, the
   remaining classes of nobility could be acquired. A newly designated
   noble was usually entitled to [41]landownership. A loss of land did not
   automatically mean loss of nobility. In later [42]Imperial Russia,
   higher ranks of state service (see [43]Table of Ranks) were
   automatically granted nobility, not necessarily associated with
   landownership.

   Titled nobility ( ) was the highest category: those who had titles such
   as [44]prince, [45]count and [46]baron. The latter two titles were
   introduced by [47]Peter the Great. A baron or count could be either
   proprietary (actual) ( ())i.e., who owned land in the [48]Russian
   Empireor titular (), i.e., only endowed with the title.

   Hereditary nobility ( ) was transferred to wife, children, and further
   direct legal descendants along the male line. In exceptional cases, the
   emperor could transfer nobility along indirect or female lines, e.g.,
   to preserve a notable family name.

   Personal nobility ( ) was transferable only to the wife and was of much
   lower prestige.

   Unpropertied nobility ( ) was nobility gained by state service, but
   which was not entitled to land ownership.

   In addition, the ancient nobility ( ) was recognized, descendants of
   historical [49]boyars and [50]knyazes.

   Russian did not employ a nobiliary particule (as [51]von in German or
   [52]de in French) before a surname, but Russian noblemen were accorded
   an official salutation that varied by their ranks: your nobility ( ),
   your high nobility ( ), your high ancestry ( ), etc.

[[53]edit] History

   The nobility arose in the 12th and 13th centuries as the lowest part of
   the feudal military class, which composed the court of a [54]prince or
   an important [55]boyar. From the 14th century land ownership by nobles
   increased, and by the 17th century it composed the bulk of [56]feudal
   lords and constituted the majority of landowners. [57]Peter the Great
   finalized the status of the nobility, while abolishing the [58]boyar
   title.

   From 1782, a kind of uniform was introduced for civilian nobles called
   uniform of civilian service or simply civilian uniform. The uniform
   prescribed colors that depended on the territory. The uniform was
   required at the places of service, at the Court, and at other important
   public places. The privileges of the nobility were fixed and were
   legally codified in 1785 in the [59]Charter to the Gentry. The Charter
   introduced an organization of the nobility: every province
   ([60]guberniya) and district ([61]uyezd) had an [62]Assembly of
   Nobility. The chair of an Assembly was called Province/District Marshal
   of Nobility.

   By 1805, the various ranks of the nobility had become confused, as is
   apparent in [63]War and Peace. Here, we see [64]counts who are
   wealthier and more important than [65]princes. We see many noble
   families whose wealth has been dissipated, partly through lack of
   [66]primogeniture and partly through extravagance and poor estate
   management. We see young noblemen serving in the Army, but we see none
   who acquire new landed estates that way. (This refers to the era of the
   [67]Napoleonic Wars. Tolstoy reported some improvement afterwards: some
   nobles paid more attention to estate management, and some, like
   [68]Andrey Bolkonsky, freed their serfs even before the [69]tsar did so
   in 1861.^[70][1].

   After the [71]peasant reform of 1861 the economic position of the
   nobility was weakened. The influence of nobility was futher reduced by
   the [72]new law statutes of 1864, under which their right of electing
   law officers was repealed. The reform of the police in 1862 limited the
   landowners authority locally, and creation of all-estate [73]Zemstvo
   local government did away with exclusive influence of nobility in local
   self-government.

   After the [74]October Revolution of 1917 all classes of nobility were
   legally abolished. Many members of the Russian nobility who fled Russia
   after the Bolshevik Revolution played a significant role in the
   [75]White Emigre communities that settled in Europe, in North America,
   and in other parts of the world. In the 1920s and 1930s, several
   Russian nobility associations were established outside Russia,
   including groups in France, Belgium, and the United States. In New
   York, the Russian Nobility Association in America was founded in 1938.
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been a growing
   interest among Russians in the role that the Russian nobility has
   played in the historical and cultural development of Russia.

[[76]edit] Acquisition of nobility

   There were several methods by which nobility might be acquired. One of
   them was the acquisition of nobility by military service.

   Between 1722 and 1845 hereditary nobility was given for long military
   service at officer rank, for civil service at the rank of
   [77]Collegiate Assessor and with any order of the Russian Empire.

   Between 1845 and 1856 nobility was bestowed for long service at the
   rank of Major and [78]State Counsellor, to all holders of the [79]Order
   of Saint George and the [80]Order of Saint Vladimir, and with the first
   degrees of other orders. Between 1856 and 1900, nobility was given to
   those rising to the rank of [81]Colonel, captain of the first rank, and
   Actual State Counsellor. The qualification of nobility was further
   restricted between 1900 and 1917 - only someone rewarded with the order
   of [82]Saint Vladimir of the third class (or higher) could become a
   hereditary noble.

[[83]edit] Privileges of the nobility

   Russian nobility possessed the following privileges:
     * The right of possession of populated estates (until 1861),
       including virtual ownership of the [84]serfs who worked on the
       estates.
     * Freedom from required military service (1762-1874; later an
       all-estate compulsory military service was introduced)
     * Freedom from [85]zemstvo duties (until the second half of 19th
       century)
     * The right to enter privileged educational institutions
       ([86]Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, [87]School of Jurisprudence and
       [88]Page Corps)
     * Freedom from [89]corporal punishment.
     * The right to have a [90]coat of arms, introduced by the end of the
       17th century.
