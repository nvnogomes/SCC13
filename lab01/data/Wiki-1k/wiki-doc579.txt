   Dynamical simulation, in [13]computational physics, is the
   [14]simulation of systems of objects that are free to move, usually in
   three dimensions according to [15]Newton's laws of dynamics, or
   approximations thereto. Dynamical simulation is used in [16]computer
   animation to assist animators to produce realistic motion, in
   [17]industrial design (for example to simulate crashes as an early step
   in [18]crash testing), and in [19]video games. Body movement is
   calculated using [20]time integration methods.

[[27]edit] Physics Engines

          Main article: [28]Physics engines

   In [29]Computer graphics, a program called a [30]Physics engine is used
   to model the behaviors of objects in space. These engines allow
   simulation of the way bodies of many types are affected by a variety of
   physical stimuli. They are also used to create Dynamical simulations
   without having to know anything about physics. Physics engines are used
   throughout the video game and movie industry, but not all physics
   engines are alike; They are generally broken into [31]real-time and the
   high precision but these are not the only options. Most real-time
   physics engines are inaccurate and yield only the barest approximation
   of the real world, whereas most high-precision engines are far too slow
   for use in everyday applications. To understand how these Physics
   engines are built, a basic understanding of physics is required.
   Physics engines are based on the actual behaviors of the world as
   described by [32]Classical mechanics. Engines do not typically account
   for Modern Mechanics (see [33]Theory of relativity and [34]Quantum
   mechanics) because most visualization deals with large bodies moving
   relatively slowly, but the most complicated engines perform
   calculations for Modern Mechanics as well as Classical. The models used
   in Dynamical simulations determine how accurate these simulations are.

[[35]edit] Particle Model

          Main article: [36]Newton's laws

   The first model which may be used in [37]Physics engines governs the
   motion of infinitesimal objects with finite mass called particles. This
   equation, called Newtons Second law (see [38]Newton's laws) or the
   definition of force, is the fundamental behavior governing all motion:

          \vec{F} = m \vec{a}

   This equation will allow us to fully model the behavior of particles,
   but this is not sufficient for most simulations because it does not
   account for asymmetric bodies or for spin. For particles, these things
   are irrelevant because particles are symmetric. This non-spinning model
   is the simplest model that can be used in a physics engine and was used
   extensively in early video games.

[[39]edit] Inertial Model

          Main articles: [40]Rigid body dynamics and [41]Moment of inertia

   Bodies in the real world deform as forces are applied to them so we
   call them soft, but these are very complicated to model and only the
   most sophisticated [42]Physics engines deal with them. We will apply
   this particle model to bodies that do not deform. This motion,
   [43]Rigid body dynamics, deals with objects that cannot change shape,
   size, or mass but can change orientation and position.

   As long as bodies are rigid, we can assume that their motion is
   described the same way as a particle; however, we now have to account
   for rotation. When we deal with complex shapes, we cannot assume that
   forces (excepting [44]Gravitation) are applied evenly or on a vector
   through the center of mass. These assumptions simplify our engine but
   do not look realistic. Therefore, to account for rotational energy and
   momentum, we must describe both the manner in which force is applied to
   the object and its shape. We describe these complex interactions with
   an equation somewhat similar to the definition of force above:

          \frac{\mathrm{d}(\mathbf{I}\boldsymbol{\omega})}{\mathrm{d}t} =
          \sum_{j=1}^N \tau_{O,j}

   where I is the [45]Moment of inertia tensor and \vec{\omega} is the
   angular velocity vector:

          \mathbf{I} = \begin{pmatrix} \int y^2+z^2\, \mathrm{d}m & -\int
          xy\, \mathrm{d}m & -\int xz\, \mathrm{d}m\\ -\int xy\,
          \mathrm{d}m & \int x^2+z^2\, \mathrm{d}m & -\int yz\,
          \mathrm{d}m \\ -\int xz\, \mathrm{d}m & -\int yz\, \mathrm{d}m &
          \int x^2+y^2\, \mathrm{d}m \end{pmatrix} \quad \hbox{and} \quad
          \boldsymbol{\omega} = \begin{pmatrix} \omega_x \\ \omega_y \\
          \omega_z \end{pmatrix}.

   The [46]Moment of inertia tensor describes the location of each
   particle of mass in a given object in relation to the object's center
   of mass. This allows us to determine how an object will spin dependent
   on the forces applied to it. This spin is quantified by the angular
   velocity \vec{\omega} . This allows us the translate any torque into a
   specific frame of reference we call the Principal Axes. These axes can
   be chosen arbitrarily but must remain constant in terms of the body
   itself. This allows us to calculate \vec{\omega} but it is much more
   complex than the particle model. This model is the most complex model
   typically used for Dynamical simulation.

   This model is the most applicable for most scientific simulations and
   other applications in which real time simulation doesnt matter, because
   at this level of complexity we account for all of Newtons laws. As long
   as we stay below relativistic speeds (see [47]Relativistic dynamics),
   this model will accurately simulate all relevant behavior. As simple as
   this is, however, it still requires the [48]Physics engine to solve
   three very complex partial differential equations at every instant we
   want to render. This is even more difficult when simulating
   [49]Non-linear forces or a [50]Force field (physics).

[[51]edit] Euler Model

          Main article: [52]Euler's equations

   The inertial model is much more complex than we typically need but it
   is the most simple to use. In this model, we do not need to change our
   forces or constrain our system. However, if we make a few intelligent
   changes to our system, simulation will become much easier, and our
   calculation time will decrease. The first constraint will be to put
   each torque in terms of the principal axes. This makes each torque much
   more difficult to program, but it simplifies our equations
   significantly. When we apply this constraint, we diagonalize the moment
   of inertia tensor, which simplifies our three equations into a special
   set of equations called [53]Euler's equations. These equations describe
   all rotational momentum in terms of the principal axes:

          \begin{matrix} I_1\dot{\omega}_{1}+(I_3-I_2)\omega_2\omega_3 &=&
          N_{1}\\ I_2\dot{\omega}_{2}+(I_1-I_3)\omega_3\omega_1 &=&
          N_{2}\\ I_3\dot{\omega}_{3}+(I_2-I_1)\omega_1\omega_2 &=& N_{3}
          \end{matrix}

     * The N terms are applied torques about the principal axes
     * The I terms are the principal moments of inertia
     * The terms are angular velocities about the principal axes

   The drawback to this model is that all the computation is on the front
   end, so it is still slower than we would like. The real usefulness is
   not apparent because it still relies on a system of non-linear
   differential equations. To alleviate this problem, we have to find a
   method that can remove the second term from the equation. This will
   allow us to integrate much more easily. The easiest way to do this is
   to assume a certain amount of symmetry.

[[54]edit] Symmetric/Torque Model

   The two types of symmetric objects that will simplify [55]Euler's
   equations are symmetric tops and symmetric spheres. The first assumes
   one degree of symmetry, this makes two of the I terms equal. These
   objects, like cylinders and tops, can be expressed with one very simple
   equation and two slightly simpler equations. This does not do us much
   good, because with one more symmetry we can get a large jump in speed
   with almost no change in appearance. The symmetric sphere makes all of
   the I terms equal (the [56]Moment of inertia scalar), which makes all
   of these equations simple:

          \begin{matrix} I\dot{\omega}_{1} &=& N_{1}\\ I\dot{\omega}_{2}
          &=& N_{2}\\ I\dot{\omega}_{3} &=& N_{3} \end{matrix}

     * The N terms are applied torques about the principal axes
     * The terms are angular velocities about the principal axes
     * The I term is the scalar [57]Moment of inertia:

          I \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \int_V l^2(m)\,dm = \iiint_V
          l^2(v)\,\rho(v)\,dv = \iiint_V
          l^2(x,y,z)\,\rho(x,y,z)\,dx\,dy\,dz \!
          where

     *
          + V is the volume region of the object,
          + r is the distance from the axis of rotation,
          + m is mass,
          + v is volume,
          + is the pointwise [58]density function of the object,
          + x, y, z are the Cartesian coordinates.

   These equations allow us to simulate the behavior of an object that can
   spin in a way very close to the method simulate motion without spin.
   This is a simple model but it is accurate enough to produce realistic
   output in real-time Dynamical simulations. It also allows a [59]Physics
   engine to focus on the changing forces and torques rather than varying
   inertia.
