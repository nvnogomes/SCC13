   writing style, yearly awards, and longevity.

[[35]edit] History

   The magazine was launched by [36]Steve Jarratt, a long-time [37]video
   games journalist who has launched several other magazines for Future.
   One of Edge's forerunners was [38]ACE,^[39][2] a current competitor is
   [40]GamesTM.

   Artwork for the hundredth issue's cover was specially provided by
   [41]Shigeru Miyamoto.

   In October 2003 the then-editor of Edge, Joao Diniz-Sanches, left the
   magazine along with deputy editor David McCarthy and other staff
   writers.^[42][3] After the walkout the editorship of Edge passed back
   to Tony Mott, who had been editor prior to Diniz-Sanches. The only team
   member to remain was Margaret Robertson, who in 2006 replaced Mott as
   editor.^[43][4] In May 2007 Robertson stepped down as editor and was
   replaced by Tony Mott, taking over as editor for the third
   time.^[44][5]

   Between 1995 and 2002, some of the content from the UK edition of Edge
   was published in the [45]United States as [46]Next Generation. In 2007
   Future's U.S. subsidary, [47]Future US began re-publishing selected
   recent Edge features on the Next Generation website;^[48][6] the Edge
   website and [49]blog were subsequently incorporated into the Next-Gen
   site.^[50][7] In July 2008 the whole site was rebranded under the Edge
   title, as that was the senior of the two brands.^[51][8]^[52][9]

[[53]edit] Features

   Each issue includes a "[54]Making-of" article on a particular game,
   usually including an interview with one of the original
   developers.^[55][10] Issue 143 introduced the "Time Extend" series of
   retrospective articles. Like the "making-of" series, each focuses on a
   single game and, with the benefit of hindsight, gives an in-depth
   examination of its most interesting or innovative attributes.^[56][11]

   "Codeshop" examines more technical subjects such as [57]3D modelling
   programs or physics [58]middleware, while "Studio Profile" and
   "University Profile" are single-page summaries ("like [59]Top Trumps,
   but for game dev") of particular developers or publishers, and
   game-related courses at [60]higher education institutions.

   Although an overall list of contributors is printed in each issue's
   [61]indicia, the magazine usually does not use [62]bylines to credit
   individual writers to specific reviews and articles, instead only
   referring to the anonymous Edge as a whole. The magazine's regular
   [63]columnists are exceptions to this practice. The three current
   columnists are [64]N'Gai Croal, [65]Randy Smith, and [66]Trigger Happy
   author [67]Steven Poole.^[68][12] In addition, several Japanese writers
   contribute to the regular "Something About Japan" feature.

   Previous columnists have included [69]Paul Rose ("Mr Biffo", the
   founder of [70]Digitiser), [71]Toshihiro Nagoshi of [72]Sega's
   [73]Amusement Vision, author [74]Tim Guest (whose column on [75]MMOs
   preceded the publication of his book Second Lives), and game developer
   [76]Jeff Minter. In addition, numerous columns were published
   [77]anonymously under the [78]pseudonym "RedEye".

   James Hutchinson's [79]comic strip Crashlander was featured in Edge
   between issues 143 and 193.^[80][13]

[[81]edit] Scoring

   It was almost three years before Edge gave a game a rating of ten out
   of ten. This score was previously defined as "revolutionary", with the
   other ratings having similar labels. However, with issue 143 the
   scoring system was changed to a simple list of "10 = ten, 9 = nine..."
   and so on, a [82]tongue-in-cheek reference to people who read too much
   into review scores.^[83][14]

   The magazine has awarded this score to ten games:
     * [84]Super Mario 64 ([85]Nintendo 64) - E35 (1996)
     * [86]Gran Turismo ([87]Sony [88]PlayStation) - E55 (1997)
     * [89]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time ([90]Nintendo 64) - E66
       (1998)
     * [91]Halo: Combat Evolved ([92]Xbox) - E105 (2001)
     * [93]Half-Life 2 ([94]Windows [95]PC) - E143 (2004)
     * [96]Halo 3 ([97]Xbox 360) - E181 (2007)
     * [98]The Orange Box ([99]Windows [100]PC, [101]PlayStation 3,
       [102]Xbox 360) - E182 (2007)
     * [103]Super Mario Galaxy ([104]Wii) - E183 (2007)
     * [105]Grand Theft Auto IV ([106]PlayStation 3, [107]Xbox 360) - E189
       (2008)
     * [108]LittleBigPlanet ([109]PlayStation 3) - E195 (2008)

   In contrast, only one title has received a one-out-of-ten rating,
   [110]Kabuki Warriors.

[[111]edit] Posthumous awards

   In a December 2002 [112]retro gaming special, Edge awarded "posthumous"
   ten-out-of-ten ratings to two titles:
     * [113]Elite (originally released in 1984)
     * [114]Exile (originally released in 1988)

   Edge also awarded a 10/10 score in one of the regular retrospective
   reviews in the magazine's normal run:
     * [115]Super Mario Bros. (originally released in 1985)

   In Edge's 10th anniversary issue in 2003, [116]GoldenEye 007 (1997) was
   included as one of the magazine's top ten shooters, along with a note
   that it was "the only other game" that should have received a ten out
   of ten rating. The game had originally been awarded a nine out of ten,
   with the magazine later stating that "a ten was considered, but
   eventually rejected".

   Resident Evil 4, which came second in Edge Presents The 100 Best
   Videogames, originally obtained a nine, but according to the 100 Best
   Videogames issue, it came "as near as dammit to the sixth (at the time)
   Edge ten".

[[117]edit] Special issues

   This section is incomplete and may require expansion and/or
   [118]cleanup.
   Please improve the article, or discuss the issue on the [119]talk page.

   A number of Edge special editions were published in the UK. These
   included:

   "The 100 most significant reviews from the first 100 issues" (2001)
          A collection of reprints of notable reviews from the magazine's
          history, along with retrospective commentary on each game. In
          addition to reviews of popular titles (including the three "ten
          out of ten" scores that had been awarded during that period), it
          also included Edge's comments on notable [120]hyped
          disappointments such as [121]Rise of the Robots and
          [122]Daikatana. The issue also included an index of the content
          of those 100 issues of the magazine.

   "Retro: The Guide to Classic Videogame Playing and Collection" (2002)
          This [123]retrogaming-themed special issue applied the format of
          the standard edition of Edge to classic video games. This was
          the most fully-formed of the Edge specials, being an edition
          that only featured new material.

   "Retro: The Making Of... Special" (2002)
          The second edition in the Retro series was a collection of
          "Making of" features, most of which had run previously in the
          main magazine. These features usually contained interviews with
          the makers of classic video games talking about the process
          invoved in their title's creation.

   "Equip: [124]PlayStation 2"
   "Equip: [125]GameCube"
   "Equip: [126]PC"
   "Equip: [127]Xbox"
          Each Equip issue discussed the state of a particular games
          platform, looking back on significant releases with the benefit
          of hindsight and outlining future developments. For example, the
          GameCube issue featured lengthy retrospectives on The Legend of
          Zelda: The Wind Waker and Animal Crossing, plus a feature on
          upcoming titles which would use the [128]Nintendo GameCube Game
          Boy Advance Cable.

   Specials issue ten: "Retro: The Collector's Series"
          This final edition in the Retro series reprinted all of the
          "Collector's Series" of articles from the main magazine. Each
          feature focused on a specific video game console of yesteryear
          and examined its history and the collectors market surrounding
          its rare or collectable games. Unusually for Edge, the majority
          of these articles were written by one video games journalist,
          [129]Simon Parkin a long-time freelance contributor to the
          magazine.^[130][15]

   "FILE Volume 1" (2006)
   "FILE Volume 2" (2007)
   "FILE Volume 3" (2007)
          Three "File" editions reprinted selected content originally
          published between 1993 and 1996 in Edge issues 136. Each volume
          of "File" covered 12 issues.^[131][16]

   "Edge Presents The Art Of Videogames" (2007)
          This went on sale [132]April 26, [133]2007 showcasing the visual
          aspect of gaming.^[134][17]

   "Edge Presents The 100 Best Videogames" (2007)
          On sale from [135]July 3, [136]2007. The list was compiled
          through a combination of suggestions from Edge readers, Edge
          staff and additional "industry experts". Each game in the list
          had a retrospective article, a full-page illustration, and a
          [137]sidebar listing readers' comments. In addition, the volume
          contained reprints of the magazine's previous "Top 100" lists
          from 2000 (issue 80) and 2003 (issue 128).^[138][18] The top 10
          of Edge Presents The 100 Best Videogames were:

    1. [139]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
    2. [140]Resident Evil 4
    3. [141]Super Mario 64
    4. [142]Half-Life 2
    5. [143]Super Mario World
    6. [144]The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
    7. [145]Halo
    8. [146]Final Fantasy XII
    9. [147]Tetris
   10. [148]Super Metroid

[[149]edit] Foreign editions

[[150]edit] Australian

   An Australian edition was briefly published in early 2004, for less
   than six months. The Australian edition consisted mostly of content
   from the UK edition, along with news on the local games industry.

[[151]edit] German

   In November 2005, a German translation was launched by the publishing
   house Computec Media AG. The German edition was thinner then the
   English original, the covers were slightly changed and the ratings
   raised. In January 2007 it was changed to a bi-monthly schedule and in
   July 2007 it was finally shut down.

[[152]edit] French

   A translated selection of articles are published with the French
   magazine Joypad .

[[153]edit] Italian

   In October 2004, an Italian localized edition was launched under the
   name "Videogiochi and published by Future Italy. In December 2006,
   Future Italy was sold to Sprea Editori which renamed it GAME PRO in May
   2007.

[[154]edit] Spanish

   A localised edition of Edge was launched in [155]Spain on [156]April
   15, [157]2006 by publisher Globus, which shares some staff from the
   On/Off editorial,^[158][19] a Globus magazine about DVD video and
   consumer technology, not in any way related to video games.^[159][20]
   It lacks some articles contained in the UK edition, such as the
   [160]Virtua Fighter 5 story which was omitted from the corresponding
   Spanish edition.^[161][21]
