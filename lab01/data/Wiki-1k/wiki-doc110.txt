   [29]Animals track listing
    1. "[30]Pigs on the Wing 1"
    2. "Dogs"
    3. "[31]Pigs (Three Different Ones)"
    4. "[32]Sheep"
    5. "[33]Pigs on the Wing 2"

   "Dogs", originally composed as "You Gotta Be Crazy", is a song by the
   [34]English [35]progressive rock band [36]Pink Floyd. It was released
   on the album [37]Animals in [38]1977. [39]Dogs are used to represent
   the megalomaniacal businessmen who destroy themselves and those around
   them by obsessing over their egos and their careers.

   During the part which includes Rick Wright's synth solo, the sounds of
   dogs barking can be heard; this sound effect was created by processing
   the sound using a [40]vocoder.

   Guitarist David Gilmour and bassist Roger Waters share vocal duties in
   the song. Gilmour sings the majority of the song, but Waters takes over
   during the last two verses. On performances of the track on the band's
   1977 "In the Flesh" tour, Gilmour would sing almost all of the song
   except for the last verse, use electric guitar for the whole track
   (instead of the acoustic guitars) and performed an extra guitar solo.

[[49]edit] Concept

   This article may contain [50]original research or [51]unverified
   claims. Please [52]improve the article by adding [53]references. See
   the [54]talk page for details. (February 2008)

   [55]Dogs are used to represent the megalomaniacal businessmen who
   destroy themselves and those around them by obsessing over their egos
   and their careers. A number of comparisons are made and metaphors used
   to show how close these businessmen are with dogs, for example "Got to
   be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed" the meat
   representing deals and opportunities for the businessmen. It is a long,
   increasingly haunting song at over seventeen minutes.

   The final verse explores a number of aspects of business life and how
   it compares to dogs, for example taking chances and being trained
   "trained not to spit in the fan", losing their individuality "broken by
   trained personnel", obeying their superiors "fitted with collar and
   chain", getting treats for good behaviour "given a pat on the back",
   being better than everyone else "breaking away from the pack" and
   getting to know everyone but spending less time with family "only a
   stranger at home". Every line of this verse begins with the word "Who",
   which prompted comparison to Allen Ginsberg's poem [56]Howl^[57][1].

   This song and the use of the word "Who" at the beginning of every line
   of the verse also illustrates the influence that Roy Harper had on the
   band. Roy Harper had used this technique on the song "The Lord's
   Prayer" from his 1973 Lifemask album, which included David Gilmour on
   guitar. Harper sang over 90 lines of a verse beginning with the words
   "whose" and "who". Roy Harper also sang on the song "Have A Cigar" from
   the "Wish You Were Here" album.

   The song concludes with these "Dogs" working themselves to death until
   they are "found dead on the phone" having been dragged down by "the
   stone", a metaphor for "the weight they used to need to throw around".

[[58]edit] Early versions

   During their tour in 1974 Pink Floyd played three new songs in the
   first half of the shows, followed by the whole of the [59]The Dark Side
   of the Moon album. Those three new songs were "You Gotta Be Crazy"
   (which would later become "Dogs"), "[60]Shine On You Crazy Diamond" and
   "Raving And Drooling" (which would later become "[61]Sheep").

   During 1974 performances of "You Gotta Be Crazy", [62]David Gilmour
   would sing the song in a faster speed than the versions on the 1975 US
   tour and the [63]Animals album. "You Gotta Be Crazy" was about the
   problems one had to deal with in life. The lyrics were modified by the
   time the song was played live in 1975 and then the lyrics changed again
   when recording [64]Animals.

   Both "You Gotta Be Crazy" and "Raving And Drooling" were originally
   planned to be on the album following the tour [65]Wish You Were Here,
   but the plans were changed (which later became a point of dispute
   between Gilmour and Waters, as an early sign of their later animosity)
   and they both ended up in different forms on [66]Animals.

   During live performances as part of Roger Waters' recent solo tours, he
   and the other musicians would play a hand of poker during the breakdown
   in the middle of the song. David Gilmour's vocal parts are sung by
   [67]Jon Carin.

[[68]edit] Trivia

     * The acoustic guitar in the beginning of the song was played by
       Gilmour in D standard tuning, meaning the guitar strings would be
       tuned as DGCFAD.

     * The main guitar solos are performed on two guitars harmonising, in
       the original recording both of these were played by David Gilmour
       and then played over one another.

     * The acoustic guitar and dog barking section of the song was
       featured on the TV show [69]WKRP in Cincinnati on the episode
       "Turkeys Away".

     * David Gilmour's use of effects on this album, especially on the
       solo in this song, demonstrate a guitar player's technique of
       getting a "wet" or ambient sound from the instrument. Effects such
       as [70]delay and [71]reverb were used to create these drenched "wet
       sounds". The attack in his playing emphasizes the wetness of the
       chorus or phasing sounds.

     * David Gilmour Used Fender Telecaster Guitar playing through a
       vintage [72]Electro Harmonix [73]Big Muff into a Yamaha RA-200
       Rotating speaker for the first guitar solo of Dogs.

[[74]edit] Cover Version

     * A cover of "Dogs" by Los Angeles based Pink Floyd tribute band
       Which One's Pink? appears on 2003 Pink Floyd tribute album [75]A
       Fair Forgery of Pink Floyd
