[[28]edit] Early life

   Callis became a wrestler after looking for a sport to play while
   attending the [29]University of Manitoba, where he earned a [30]Degree
   in [31]Political Studies.

[[32]edit] Career

   He was trained by local wrestling promoter Tony Condello and debuted in
   1989. Wrestling under the name Don Casablancas, Callis formed a [33]tag
   team with [34]Rick Martel known as "The Supermodels". He also teamed
   with The Psycho as "The Mercenaries of Mayhem" under the tutelage of
   their [35]manager The Golden Sheik.

   In 1990, Callis debuted with the West Four Wrestling Alliance, where he
   became a five time Heavyweight Champion. Callis began a heated feud
   with former partner Rick Martel in June 1994. He also toured in
   [36]Japan, [37]South Africa and [38]Lebanon.

[[39]edit] World Wrestling Federation

   He received a tryout match with the [40]World Wrestling Federation
   (WWF) in 1996 and was eventually hired as a [41]manager.

   On [42]September 20, [43]1997, Callis debuted in the WWF as "The
   Jackyl," a member (and eventually leader) of a group of wrestlers known
   as "[44]The Truth Commission" (a take on the South African [45]Truth
   and Reconciliation Commission). An article in WWF Magazine claimed that
   he was a lower-level WWF employee during the early 1990s, and that he
   developed a messianic complex when he led a group of WWF superstars out
   of [46]Kuwait when they were stranded there during the [47]Gulf War. In
   an effort to play up the Jackyl's gimmick as a charismatic,
   power-hungry fanatic, commentator [48]Jim Ross often referred to him as
   the "[49]David Koresh of the World Wrestling Federation." The
   [50]stable was not particularly successful, with their biggest
   achievement being their victory over the "Disciples of Apocalypse" at
   [51]Survivor Series 1997.

   Callis returned to television in 1998, forming a stable known as
   "[52]The Parade of Human Oddities". The group consisted of "freakish"
   wrestlers, including "Golga" (a masked [53]John Tenta AKA
   "Earthquake"), and [54]Howard Stern Show regulars [55]Hank the Angry
   Drunken Dwarf and [56]Crackhead Bob, and had entrance music performed
   by the [57]Insane Clown Posse. The stable did not last long, and Callis
   eventually started managing the new tag team of [58]Faarooq and
   [59]Bradshaw, [60]Hell's Henchmen, until he requested and was granted a
   release just a few months later - following which they found a new
   leader in [61]the Undertaker, became [62]the Acolytes of his
   [63]Ministry, and broke away to make their mark as the [64]Acolyte
   Protection Agency.

[[65]edit] Extreme Championship Wrestling

   In late 1999, Callis debuted in ECW as "Cyrus", a commentator who was
   presented as working for [66]TNN, the TV network that was broadcasting
   ECW. His character represented many of the real problems between ECW
   and TNN at that point, as he constantly criticised the violent nature
   of ECW programming. Callis teamed with the anti-hardcore [67]Steve
   Corino, and eventually formed a stable with Corino, [68]Yoshihiro
   Tajiri and [69]Rhino known as [70]The Network. He engaged in a
   long-term feud with commentator [71]Joel Gertner, which culminated in a
   match on [72]October 1, 2000 at the "Anarchy Rulz" event, in which
   Gertner was triumphant. ECW would declare bankruptcy soon after.

   With ECW gone and [73]World Championship Wrestling purchased by the
   WWF, Callis returned to university, eventually earned a [74]Master of
   Business Administration. He also briefly operated the No Holds Barred
   Wrestling Camp, a Winnipeg based wrestling training camp.

[[75]edit] Total Nonstop Action Wrestling

   In 2003, Callis debuted in [76]Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as
   a "[77]Management Consultant". During this time he claimed credit for
   the [78]Ultimate X match, which he said he devised to settle the
   dispute over who was the X Division champion once and for all. He
   engaged in a power struggle with then Director of Authority [79]Erik
   Watts and used his power to make life difficult for [80]Jerry Lynn,
   repeatedly fining and suspending him. On [81]January 28, [82]2004
   Callis succeeded in ousting Watts from TNA when he defeated him in a
   match for control of TNA. After this he quietly departed the company.

[[83]edit] Retirement

   Callis departed TNA on good terms later that year, having been offered
   a job in [84]International trade that made use of his MBA. Callis is
   all but retired from professional wrestling, although he made an
   appearance at the ECW reunion show [85]Hardcore Homecoming on [86]June
   10, [87]2005.

   Callis also wrote weekly wrestling columns for the Sun media group and
   co-hosted a local [88]Winnipeg radio show called "No Holds Barred" with
   Joe Aiello on 92 CITI FM.

[[89]edit] Personal life

   Callis has expressed an interest in participating in [90]Canadian
   politics, and worked as a Media Relations Specialist for the
   [91]Canadian House of Commons in the early 1990s.

   In a [92]shoot interview and in his biography, [93]Matt Hardy claimed
   that Callis had heaps of heat backstage due to his perceived arrogant
   personality and not fitting in. Hardy also told the story of how he
   (told to by [94]Bradshaw) put toothpicks into his car as a rib.^[95][1]
