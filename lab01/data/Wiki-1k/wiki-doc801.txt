   (1967) [21]The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark
   (1968)

   Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers is the debut solo [22]album of
   [23]Gene Clark. It was his first effort after his departure from
   [24]folk-rock group [25]the Byrds in 1966. Though the album was a
   critical success and it established Clark as a talented
   [26]singer-songwriter, it was released simultaneously with the Byrds'
   album [27]Younger Than Yesterday in both the USA and UK and was a
   commercial failure. Clark's backing musicians on the album include
   former bandmates [28]Chris Hillman and [29]Michael Clarke, future Byrd
   [30]Clarence White, Clark's frequent collaborator [31]Doug Dillard, and
   folk/country vocal duo the [32]Gosdin Brothers.

   In Europe, the album was issued (several months later) under the title
   "Echoes", and included two bonus tracks - "The French Girl" (an [33]Ian
   and Sylvia song) and "Only Colombe".

   The album was also reissued in the US in the early 70s, omitting
   "Elevator Operator", and with re-recorded backing tracks designed to
   "soften" the sound, under the title Early LA Sessions.

   A subsequent reissue, on CD in 1991, was also titled Echoes, and also
   remixed (though closer to the sound of the original album - the most
   significant change was the removal of vocal double-tracking), with an
   altered running order, as well as the original European bonus tracks, a
   demo outtake, and miscellaneous Clark-penned songs from early Byrds
   recordings.

   The 2007 reissue on Sundazed restored the original album mix and track
   order, and uncovered a number of alternate takes from the album
   sessions (though no new songs were discovered).
