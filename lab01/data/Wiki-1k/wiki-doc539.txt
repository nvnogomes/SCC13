   Durham Technical Community College (often DTCC or Durham Tech) is a
   public two-year accredited institution of higher education and
   technical training school located in [9]Durham, North Carolina,
   [10]USA. Durham Tech's main campus is near to downtown Durham,
   [11]Research Triangle Park, and [12]Raleigh-Durham International
   Airport. The college also offers instruction at centers in northern
   [13]Durham County and in [14]Orange County. Some Durham Tech classes
   are taught on [15]Chapel Hill High School and [16]Orange High School
   campuses.

   Durham Tech serves over 25,000 students with credit, non-credit, adult,
   and continuing education offerings. Durham Tech offers career programs
   leading to over 100 degrees, certificates, and diplomas and university
   transfer programs. As of 2004, the school boasted 510 faculty members
   and 5,663 matriculated students.

   A large portion of DTCC's students are part-time. In order to give them
   flexibility, DTCC has a large [17]distance education program, offering
   numerous [18]online courses and telecourses.

   DTCC is a charter member of the [19]North Carolina Community College
   System, and is accredited by the [20]Southern Association of Colleges
   and Schools.

[[25]edit] History

   On September 5, 1961, the institution was founded as Durham Industrial
   Education Center. On March 30, 1965, the institution changed its name
   to Durham Technical Institute, at the specification of the State Board
   of Education. On July 22, 1986, the institution changed its name to
   Durham Technical Community College, when the North Carolina General
   Assembly approved Durham Techs request to add a university transfer
   program.

   A 19.6-acre (79,000 m^2) campus in [26]Hillsborough, North Carolina is
   currently in development, and will accommodate as many as 2,500
   students when completed.

   trail: a sign to demarcate the trail entrance, a security gate to close
   the trail at sundown, trashcans and benches, and flora identifier
   signs.
