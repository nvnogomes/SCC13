Pierre Mailloux

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Doc Mailloux)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   Dr. Pierre Mailloux (better known as Doc Mailloux or Docteur Mailloux)
   (born [9]January 14, 1949) is a [10]psychiatrist hosting a long-running
   [11]French-language [12]talk show with Janine Ross on [13]CKAC radio in
   [14]Montreal, with a large audience.

[[15]edit] Background

   He was born in Normandin, [16]Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of
   [17]Quebec. He studied medicine at [18]Universit Laval in [19]Quebec
   City and psychiatry at [20]McGill University in [21]Montreal.

   In 1975, after serving as psychiatrist for the [22]Canadian Forces, he
   started working with assault offenders and participated in numerous
   trials as an expert witness on the psychiatric domain.

   In 1988, he lost a leg in an accident while helping a motorist trapped
   in his stalled car on the side of the highway.

   In 1995, he started his radio career with [23]CKAC, a Montreal radio
   station. Over the years, the title of his radio show on [24]Radiomdia
   network has changed from Un psy l'coute to Deux psy l'coute to Doc
   Mailloux. However, in 2007, CKAC became a sports dedicated radio
   station and the program was cancelled. It's not clear yet if he will
   pursue his talk show career with an other radio station or not.

   Mailloux has also written several books.

[[25]edit] Controversies

   He is notorious for his controversial on-air comments and in 2002 was
   officially reprimanded by the Collge des mdecins for making a diagnosis
   on the air, comments considered "unworthy of a doctor" and inaccurate
   informations he gave about a drug.

   Other topics he often speaks about include voluntary [26]castration of
   [27]paedophiles, violence toward children, incest and he often
   criticizes [28]feminists.

   He served as an on-air psychiatrist for the Quebec version of the
   [29]reality show [30]Loft Story, where he made remarks that upset the
   parents of a participant while analyzing her behaviour.

   On [31]February 10, [32]2005, the Quebec Regional Panel of the
   [33]Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, answering a listener's
   complaint, determined that Mailloux had made "specifically-focused
   abusive and unduly discriminatory remarks" toward ethnic groups when
   talking about [34]immigration in a broadcast. He referred to [35]Sikhs
   as a "gang of [36]bozos" (translated). They ruled that, in doing so,
   Mailloux and the station broke the [37]human rights clause of the
   [38]Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of Ethics.

   On [39]June 23, the [40]Canadian Radio-television and
   Telecommunications Commission released a similar ruling on two other
   comments, including a statement that "Native Americans and Black people
   from the [41]Americas are born less intelligent than white people"
   because of [42]artificial selection from [43]slavery and the Europeans
   who used to kill the the smartest "Indians" to better control the
   population. He said that it accounts for their poverty and high
   unemployment rate. He also stated that "[44]Janet Jackson exhibits
   tribal behaviour".

   On [45]September 25, [46]2006 he appeared on the widely-viewed Qubec
   television talk show, [47]Tout le monde en parle and cited unspecified
   studies allegedly used at the [48]Universit de Montral in
   psycho-education classes, stating that Black people in the [49]Americas
   and Native Americans have a lower IQ average then white and Asian
   Americans, a currently controversial topic of study about [50]race and
   intelligence.

   He was indefinitely barred from the Collge des mdecins in January 2007
   for prescribing abusive doses of [51]neuroleptics to two of his
   patients and because of his earlier radio and TV claims and comments.
   The collge determined that Mailloux posed a threat to the medical
   profession. However, the CKRS radio station and a viewer circulated a
   petition for the College to reinstate Mailloux until his hearing in
   front of the discipline committee.[52][1] He has since been reinstated
   and has resumed his practice.

   On [53]March 20, 2007, a [54]Journal de Montral news article reported
   that in an interview with [55]Tele-Quebec's host [56]Richard Martineau,
   Mailloux said that women manage stress more poorly than men, that they
   are also less able to make decisions under pressure. He also said he
   would never work for a woman. He made rude gestures and obscene
   language towards the host as well. Tele-Quebec did not air the
   interview and never released any footage from that single 8 hour long
   session at Mailloux's farm. [57][2]

   In September 2007, during an interview on a [58]Rouyn-Noranda radio
   station, Mailloux made controversial comments about the mayor of
   [59]Saguenay, Quebec, [60]Jean Tremblay after he read a memoir at the
   [61]Bouchard-Taylor Commission on the [62]reasonable accommodations. In
   the memoir, Tremblay was in favor of maintaining Catholic traditions
   like the traditional prayer before each City Council meeting and
   keeping the cross in Saguenay's City Hall. Mailloux also criticized the
   population of the city, saying its citizens lacked judgement by voting
   for Tremblay, also explaining the high unemployment rate in the
   [63]Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. [64][3]
