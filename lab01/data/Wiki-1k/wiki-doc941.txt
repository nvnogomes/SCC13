[[35]edit] Early Life

   Roye was born into a prosperous [36]African American family in
   [37]Newark, Ohio. Roye was a pure descendant of the [38]Igbo
   people.^[39][1]^[40][2] His father, John Roye, managed a ferry across
   the [41]Wabash River at [42]Terre Haute, [43]Indiana and, through
   conservative management of his resources, acquired considerable land in
   Terre Haute as well as [44]Vandalia in the neighboring state of
   [45]Illinois. As a result of the family's financial standing, young
   Edward was able to attend the then-30-year-old (founded 1804) [46]Ohio
   University in the other neighboring state's town of [47]Athens. In
   1836, upon the premature death of his father, Edward relocated to Terre
   Haute where he established the community's largest barber shop,
   boasting a 79-foot (24 m) high barber pole, "the tallest in western
   Indiana".

   In 1846, attracted by the [48]American Colonization Society, Roye
   immigrated to Liberia and set up business as a merchant. Within three
   years of his arrival, he became active in Liberian politics. Before
   being elected president he served as Speaker of the [49]Liberian House
   of Representatives and Chief Justice of the [50]Supreme Court of
   Liberia.

[[51]edit] Presidency (1870-71)

   Edward J. Roye was inaugurated as President of Liberia on [52]January
   3, [53]1870.

   The decades after 1868, escalating economic difficulties weakened the
   state's dominance over the coastal indigenous population. Conditions
   worsened, the cost of imports was far greater than the income generated
   by exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugarcane, and timber. Liberia
   tried desperately to modernize its largely agricultural economy.

[[54]edit] Financial problems

   As Roye took office, the country was in the midst of political
   instability exacerbated by a fiscal crisis. Roye began a program of
   reconstruction for his nation intending to build new roads and schools.
   In order to raise the funds for these projects, Roye sailed for England
   where he began negotiations with London banks. The results proved
   ruinous. The terms of the loans were severe; among other things, the
   interest rate on the loan was 7 percent. Roye hastily agreed to the
   loans without consulting the legislature. Liberia actually received
   about $90,000, while bonds were issued for $400,000.

   Because of increasing world competition from Brazilian coffee, European
   sugar beets, and steamers, Liberia was unable to generate sufficient
   export revenue, and defaulted on the loan negotiated by Roye. Recession
   forced Liberia into a series of ever larger loans. The decline of
   Liberia's exports and its inability to pay its debts resulted in a
   large measure of foreign interference.

[[55]edit] Impeachment

   The whole affair caused great resentment against Roye and when he
   returned home from England, he was accused of embezzlement. He then
   tried to extend his two-year term of president by edict after the
   people rose up against him.

   On [56]October 26, [57]1871, after less than 22 months in office,
   Edward J. Roye was deposed from office. He was brought to trial, but
   escaped in the night.

[[58]edit] Death

   No specific historical record is available detailing the date and
   circumstances of his death, although varying accounts indicate that he
   was brutally killed on [59]February 11 or [60]February 12, [61]1872.
   Another account suggests that he drowned while trying to reach a
   British ship in Monrovia harbor, on Feb. 12, 1872.

   A portrait of President Roye in the gallery of the Presidential Mansion
   in [62]Monrovia gives the date of his death as February 11.[63][1]
