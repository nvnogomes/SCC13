[[52]edit] Career

   Conner began his wrestling career in [53]New Jersey as Ace the Animal.
   He then wrestled [54]Earthquake in the WWF in 1993 under his given name
   as a [55]jobber. This led to his first widely known accomplishment in
   [56]Smoky Mountain Wrestling, becoming the head of security for [57]The
   Gangstas. When the Gangstas left SMW in 1995, he signed a deal with the
   WWF and was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association for more
   training while making more appearances as a jobber on WWF television.

[[58]edit] World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (19972003)

   Conner made his official [59]WWF debut in 1997 as a member of
   [60]Faarooq's [61]Nation of Domination [62]heel [63]stable, most
   notably along with [64]Rocky Maivia, [65]Kama Mustafa, and [66]Mark
   Henry. In early 1998, the group [67]turned on Faarooq, allowing Maivia
   to assume leadership as The Rock as Kama became The Godfather. D'Lo and
   Henry eventually turned on both Rock and Godfather separately, moving
   into a feud with the Rock before finally branching out as a moderately
   successful [68]tag team, later turning [69]face along the way. Prior to
   the face turn, Brown had started wrestling with a chest protector,
   supposedly for a torn [70]pectoral muscle sustained in a match against
   [71]Dan "The Beast" Severn. Instead, he used the chest protector to his
   advantage, making his finishing move, the [72]Lo Down, more effective.
   His career peaked when he held the [73]European and
   [74]Intercontinental Championships simultaneously. This feat was only
   duplicated by [75]Jeff Jarrett, [76]Kurt Angle, and [77]Rob Van Dam,
   all of whom became World Heavyweight Champions in some form since said
   double reigns.

   Brown was involved in inadvertently ending the career of [78]Darren
   Drozdov on October 5, 1999 when a [79]running powerbomb was [80]botched
   due to Droz's baggy shirt. The match was to be aired on the October 7
   edition of [81]SmackDown!. The match was never aired and Drozdov
   suffered a severe neck injury, leaving him a [82]quadriplegic. During
   the rest of the year and into some of the next, Brown became an ally of
   former fellow Nation member The Godfather, emulating his dress and
   walking motions. The teaming ended when Brown turned heel on the
   Godfather.

   Brown then formed a tag team in July 2000 with [83]Chaz named [84]Lo
   Down. The team mostly wrestled on [85]Sunday Night Heat and [86]WWE
   Jakked / Metal. Shortly after the team formed, [87]Tiger Ali Singh
   joined the team to become their [88]manager. The tag team then came
   dressed towards the ring in Arabic ring attire and took on a
   [89]gimmick very similar to Tiger's. The team was removed from WWF
   [90]TV in January 2001. Chaz and Singh were later be released by WWE
   while D'Lo Brown stayed in WWE's developmental territory. D'Lo returned
   to TV on the April 28, 2002 episode of Heat, losing to [91]Eddie
   Guerrero.

   For the rest of the year, Brown mostly wrestled on Heat, did a little
   bit of commentary on the show, and even started a brief feud with
   [92]Raven. In late 2002, [93]Theodore Long retired as a WWE [94]referee
   and managed D'Lo, who had complained about acts of [95]racism being
   talked about on him during his matches. D'Lo started Theodore Long's
   group Thuggin' and Buggin' Enterprises which eventually turned into a
   group of African Americans who worked an angle in which they felt they
   were victims of racism and were being held down by the "white man."
   With Long's managerial services, D'Lo Brown went undefeated for several
   weeks.

   Brown faced [96]Booker T in a losing effort on the February 10, 2003
   episode of [97]Raw. His involvement with Thuggin' and Buggin'
   Enterprises was brought to a close when footage was shown on the
   February 16 episode of Heat of Theodore Long kicking D'Lo Brown to the
   curb and introducing his replacement [98]Rodney Mack. He was then
   released from his WWE contract on February 14, 2003.

[[99]edit] All Japan Pro Wrestling and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling
(20052007)

   Conner, still under the D'Lo Brown name, went on to wrestle for
   [100]Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and [101]All Japan Pro Wrestling,
   competing in regular tours with the Japanese company as a member of
   [102]Roughly Obsess and Destroy (RO&D). During one of these tours on
   September 17, 2006, Brown betrayed RO&D to join the rival [103]Voodoo
   Murders faction. Brown left All Japan in 2007 and rejoined [104]RO&D in
   [105]Pro Wrestling Noah.

   When not in Japan, Brown was regularly found touring the [106]United
   Kingdom, as well as working for [107]Irish Whip Wrestling in
   [108]Ireland. In April 2005, Brown became one of the lead trainers of
   the illfated [109]Celebrity Wrestling on [110]ITV. This Saturday
   evening [111]reality show saw [112]celebrities learn wrestling and
   compete in challenge matches. After a few weeks the programme was to be
   cancelled, but was instead moved to Sunday mornings to finish its final
   episodes. During his time wrestling in [113]England, he would face off
   in a series of matches against his Celebrity Wrestling opposition's
   trainer, [114]Joe Legend.

[[115]edit] Return to WWE (20082009)

   In 2008, Brown wrestled in a number of [116]dark matches for World
   Wrestling Entertainment, with his most notable win against [117]Ron
   Killings.

   Months later, on June 5, 2008, WWE announced that Brown had been signed
   to a contract, and he began working more dark matches for the
   company.^[118][5] He made his television return on the July 21, 2008
   edition of [119]Raw, where he defeated [120]Santino Marella. Despite
   this win, Brown has since lost to Marella on Raw and has mainly been
   competing in dark matches before the flagship broadcast. Brown returned
   to Raw to face [121]Mike Knox. He lost after Mike Knox delivered a
   [122]Knox Out. On January 9th, 2009, it was announced on WWE.com that
   D'Lo had been released from his World Wrestling Entertainment
   contract.^[123][6] PWInsider.com released the following statement
   saying that "Brown had been hired last June and sparsely used since he
   was brought back. He had held the Intercontinental and European
   championships during his first run with the company but once he was
   brought back, creatively he was given nothing to do".^[[124]citation
   needed][125][1]

[[126]edit] Return to the independent circuit (2009present)

   Brown is set to debut for [127]Ring of Honor when the company tours
   Florida once again. He was defeated by [128]Nigel McGuinness in a
   [129]ROH World Championship match. Varsity Pro Wrestling has also
   announced that Brown will be making his third appearance for the
   promotion on their February tour.

[[130]edit] Personal life

   Conner is a [131]Certified Public Accountant (CPA) graduating from the
   [132]University of Maine.^[133][2]^[134][3] He's been married to his
   wife Jennifer since 2001 and they have a daughter together and a second
   child due in August 2009.
