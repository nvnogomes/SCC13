   Edward Burch (born June 9, 1968 in [13]Centreville, Illinois, near his
   home town of [14]Dupo, Illinois) is a Chicago and Champaign,
   Illinois-based musician and journalist. As a [15]guitarist, he is a
   founding member of [16]alternative country band The Kennett Brothers
   and, as a suitcase player, of the quasi-[17]skiffle combo [18]The Viper
   and His Famous Orchestra. He has been a longtime collaborator of former
   Titanic Love Affair and [19]Wilco multi-instrumentalist [20]Jay
   Bennett.^[21][1] He was a regular contributor to such advocacy
   journalism outlets as [22]Clamor and Pamphlet, as well as "Harp" and
   "[23]No Depression" magazines.

[[29]edit] Downstate

   Burch grew up a stone's throw from St. Louis as part of a West Central
   Illinois musical cohort that included nearby [30]Belleville, Illinois's
   [31]Jeff Tweedy and [32]Jay Farrar (of [33]Uncle Tupelo and later,
   respectively, [34]Wilco and [35]Son Volt). As an undergraduate and
   graduate student at the flagship campus of the University of Illinois,
   Burch entered a burgeoning Champaign-Urbana scene that included bands
   such as [36]Poster Children, Menthol, [37]Hum, and [38]Braid. Burch
   performed with a number of groups during this time, including Bitter
   Homes and Gardens, The Kennett Brothers, The Corn Likkers, and [39]The
   Viper and His Famous Orchestra. It was also during this time (as early
   as 1994) that he began his writing and home studio recording
   collaborations with Jay Bennett that would eventually see light as
   2002's The Palace at 4 a.m. (Part 1).

[[40]edit] Chicago

   Burch briefly relocated to Chicago in the early aughts, where he had a
   standing Monday-night gig at the Hideout, a center of the Chicago
   alt-country scene. At the Hideout, he could be heard performing with
   the likes of multi-instrumentalist [41]LeRoy Bach, violinist [42]Andrew
   Bird, and the [43]Handsome Family. In 2000, Burch compiled, produced,
   and played on a seminal collection of Champaign/Chicago Christmas
   strangeness titled Santa Is Real, its Burch-designed cover a masterful
   yuletide fire-and-brimstone parody of the [44]Louvin Brothers' country
   gospel classic, Satan Is Real. In addition to tracks by the Kennetts,
   the Viper, and Burch (including his haunting version of the [45]Johnny
   Marks tune "There's Always Tomorrow" from the [46]Rudolph the Red-Nosed
   Reindeer television special), the collection featured recordings by
   Wilco alumns Bennett, Bach, and [47]John Stirratt.

[[48]edit] The Palace at 4 a.m. (Part I)

   As Bennett's time with Wilco drew to a close (very publicly documented
   in the [49]Sam Jones (filmmaker) film [50]I Am Trying to Break Your
   Heart), and on the same day on which Wilco's 2002 recording [51]Yankee
   Hotel Foxtrot was released, Bennett and Burch released The Palace at 4
   a.m. (Part 1) through Chicago's Undertow Records, to generally strong
   reviews. Rolling Stone's David Fricke wrote: "If there is a Part II to
   this pop sunshine, may it come soon." Unfortunately for listeners and
   music fans, it hasn't come soon enough.

[[52]edit] Journalism

   Though Burch continued to perform in the mid-aughts, he also turned his
   efforts increasingly to political, advocacy, and cultural journalism,
   writing especially for the short-lived Champaign alternative The Paper,
   [53]Clamor, and Pamphlet (an online journal Burch founded with fellow
   Champaign writer Jenny Southlynn). Burch's published interviews are
   with subjects as diverse as people's historian [54]Howard Zinn and
   1960s folk icon [55]Dick Smothers. Pamphlet provides a wide-ranging
   forum in which Burch's reporting on the adoption of tasers by local
   police can sit comfortably next to his listener's guide to the music of
   [56]T. Rex (band).
