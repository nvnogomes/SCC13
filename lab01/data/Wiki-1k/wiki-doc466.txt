   Duck is the common name for a number of species in the [25]Anatidae
   family of [26]birds. The ducks are divided between several subfamilies
   listed in full in the [27]Anatidae article; they do not represent a
   [28]monophyletic group but a [29]form taxon, being the Anatidae not
   considered [30]swans and [31]geese. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds,
   mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh
   water and sea water.

   Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water
   birds with similar forms, such as [32]loons or divers, [33]grebes,
   [34]gallinules, and [35]coots.

Etymology

   Female Mallard

   The word duck (from [51]Anglo-Saxon dce), meaning the bird, came from
   the verb "to duck" (from Anglo-Saxon supposed *dcan) meaning "to bend
   down low as if to get under something" or "to dive", because of the way
   many species in the [52]dabbling duck group feed by upending (compare
   [53]Dutch duiken, [54]German tauchen = "to dive").

   This happened because the older [55]Anglo-Saxon words ened (= "duck")
   and ende (= "end") came to be pronounced the same: other Germanic
   languages still have similar words for "duck" and "end": for example,
   Dutch eend = "duck", eind = "end", German Ente = "duck", Ende = "end";
   this similarity goes back to [56]Proto-Indo-European: compare [57]Latin
   anas ([58]stem anat-) = "duck", [59]Lithuanian antis = "duck",
   [60]Ancient Greek , (nssa, ntta) = "duck"; [61]Sanskrit anta = "end".

   Some people use "duck" specifically for adult females and "drake" for
   adult males, for the species described here; others use "hen" and
   "drake", respectively.

   A duckling is a young duck in downy plumage^[62][1] or baby
   duck.^[63][2]; but in the food trade young adult ducks ready for
   roasting are sometimes labelled "duckling".

Morphology

   Male [64]Mandarin Duck

   The overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and the ducks
   are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese
   and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in
   being more rounded. The bill is usually broad and contains serrated
   [65]lamellae] which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding
   species. In the case of some fishing species the bill is long and
   strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and
   generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic
   species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed,
   and the [66]flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring
   in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of [67]steamer duck are
   almost flightless however. Many species of duck are temporarily
   flightless while [68]moulting; they seek out protected habitat with
   good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes
   [69]migration.

   The drakes of northern species often have extravagant [70]plumage, but
   that is [71]moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance,
   the "eclipse" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less
   [72]sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions like the
   [73]Paradise Shelduck of [74]New Zealand which is both strikingly
   sexually dimorphic and where the female's plumage is brighter than that
   of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of
   the female.

Behaviour

Feeding

   [75]Lamellae along the beak.

   Ducks exploit a variety of food sources such as [76]grasses, aquatic
   plants, fish, insects, small amphibians^[77][3], worms, and small
   [78]molluscs.

   [79]Diving ducks and [80]sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able
   to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling
   ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly.

   [81]Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep
   as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging. ^[82][4]
   Along the inside of the beak they have tiny rows of plates called
   [83]lamellae like a whale's [84]baleen. These let them filter water out
   of the side of their beaks and keep food inside.

   A few specialized species such as the [85]smew, [86]goosander, and the
   [87]mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large fish.

Breeding

   The ducks are generally [88]monogamous, although these bonds generally
   last a single year only. Larger species and the more sedentary species
   (like fast river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last
   numerous years. Most duck species breed once a year, choosing to do so
   in favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons).

Communication

   Despite widespread misconceptions, only the females of most
   [89]dabbling ducks "quack". For example, the [90]scaup which are
   [91]diving ducks make a noise like "scaup" (hence their name), and even
   among the dabbling ducks, the males never quack. In general, ducks make
   a wide range of [92]calls, ranging from whistles cooing, yodels and
   grunts. Calls may be loud displaying calls or quieter contact calls.

   A common [93]urban legend claims that duck quacks do not echo; however,
   this has been shown to be false. This myth was first debunked by the
   Acoustics Research Centre at the [94]University of Salford in 2003 as
   part of the [95]British Association's Festival of Science.^[96][5] It
   was also debunked in [97]one of the earlier episodes of the popular
   Discovery Channel television show [98]MythBusters.^[99][6]

Distribution and habitat

   The ducks have a [101]cosmopolitan distribution occurring across most
   of the world except for [102]Antarctica. A number of species manage to
   live on sub-Antarctic islands like [103]South Georgia and the
   [104]Auckland Islands. Numerous ducks have managed to establish
   themselves on oceanic islands such as [105]Hawaii, [106]New Zealand and
   [107]Kerguelen, although many of these species and populations are
   threatened or have become extinct.

   Some duck species, mainly those breeding in the temperate and Arctic
   Northern Hemisphere, are migratory; those in the tropics, however, are
   generally not. Some ducks, particularly in Australia where rainfall is
   patchy and erratic, are nomadic, seeking out the temporary lakes and
   pools that form after localised heavy rain.^[[108]citation needed]

   Ducks have become an accepted presence in populated areas. Migration
   patterns have changed such that many species remain in an area during
   the winter months. In spring and early summer ducks sometimes influence
   human activity through their nesting; sometimes a duck pair nests well
   away from water, needing a long trek to water for the hatchlings: this
   sometimes causes an urgent [109]wildlife rescue operation (e.g. by the
   [110]RSPCA) if the duck nested somewhere unsuitable like in a small
   enclosed [111]courtyard.

Predators

   [112]Ringed Teal

   Worldwide, ducks have many predators. Ducklings are particularly
   vulnerable, since their inability to fly makes them easy prey not only
   for avian hunters but also large fish like [113]pike,
   [114]crocodilians, and other aquatic hunters, including fish-eating
   birds such as [115]herons. Ducks' nests are raided by land-based
   predators, and brooding females may be caught unaware on the nest by
   mammals such as foxes, or large birds, such as hawks or eagles.

   Adult ducks are fast fliers, but may be caught on the water by large
   aquatic predators. This can includes fish such as the North American
   [116]muskie and the European [117]pike. In flight, ducks are safe from
   all but a few predators such as humans and the [118]Peregrine Falcon,
   which regularly uses its speed and strength to catch ducks.

Relationship with humans

Domestication

          Main article: [119]Domestic duck

   Domesticated duck headcount in 2004

   Ducks have many economic uses, being farmed for their meat, eggs,
   feathers, (particularly their [120]down). They are also kept and bred
   by aviculturists and often displayed in zoos. All domestic ducks are
   descended from the wild [121]Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, except the
   [122]Muscovy Duck ^[123][7]. Many domestic breeds have become much
   larger than their wild ancestor, with a "hull length" (from base of
   neck to base of tail) of 30 cm (12 inches) or more and routinely able
   to swallow an adult [124]British [125]Common Frog Rana temporaria
   whole; the wild mallard's "hull length" is about 6 inches.

   [126]FAO reports that China is the top duck market in 2004 followed by
   [127]Vietnam and other [128]South East Asian countries.

   In many areas, wild ducks of various species (including ducks farmed
   and released into the wild) are hunted for food or sport, by shooting,
   or formerly by decoys. Because an idle, floating duck or a duck
   squatted on land cannot react to fly or to move quickly, "a sitting
   duck" has come to mean "an easy target".

   Wild ducks of many species and domesticated breeds are widely
   [129]consumed around the world.

Cultural references

   A male and female [130]Wood Duck

   In 2002, psychologist [131]Richard Wiseman and colleagues at the
   [132]University of Hertfordshire, [133]UK, finished a year-long
   [134]LaughLab experiment, concluding that of all animals, ducks attract
   most the humor and silliness; he said "If you're going to tell a joke
   involving an animal, make it a duck." The word "duck" may have become
   an [135]inherently funny word in many languages possibly because ducks
   are seen as silly in their looks or behavior. Of the many [136]ducks in
   fiction, many are cartoon characters like [137]Daffy Duck (see the
   [138]New Scientist article [139][1] mentioning humor in the word
   "duck").

   A [140]duck test is a form of [141]inductive reasoning, which can be
   phrased as follows: "If a bird looks like a duck, swims like a duck and
   quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck." The test implies that
   a person can figure out the true nature of an unknown subject by
   observing this subject's readily identifiable traits. It is sometimes
   used to counter abstruse arguments that something is not what it
   appears to be. This is used in the computer science term of [142]Duck
   typing.
