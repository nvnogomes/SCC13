[[39]edit] History

   EOU opened its doors in 1929 as Eastern Oregon Normal School, a
   [40]Teachers College. In 1939, the Oregon Legislature changed the name
   to Eastern Oregon College of Education. The words "of Education" were
   dropped from the college's name in 1956. The 1973 Legislature changed
   EOC's name to Eastern Oregon State College. In 1997, Eastern Oregon
   State College became Eastern Oregon University.

[[41]edit] Campus setting

   EOU's location in La Grande is in the heart of the [42]Blue Mountain
   range between [43]Portland, Oregon and [44]Boise, Idaho just off
   [45]Interstate 84. Driving to La Grande takes approximately 4 hours
   from Portland, 3 from Boise, 5 from [46]Seattle, and 4 from
   [47]Spokane.

   The campus contains 26 buildings, including 4 living facilities Alikut
   Hall, Hunt Hall, North Hall, and South Hall all of which are co-ed.

[[48]edit] Academics
