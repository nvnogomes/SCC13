   David Takayoshi Suzuki, [85]CC, [86]Order of British Columbia (born
   March 24, 1936), is a [87]Canadian [88]science [89]broadcaster and
   [90]environmental activist. Since the mid-1970s, Suzuki has been known
   for his TV and radio series and books about nature and the environment.
   He is best known as host of the popular and long-running [91]CBC
   Television science magazine, [92]The Nature of Things, seen in
   syndication in over forty nations. He is also well known for
   criticizing governments for their lack of action to protect the
   environment.

   A long time activist to reverse global [93]climate change, Suzuki
   co-founded the [94]David Suzuki Foundation in 1990, to work "to find
   ways for society to live in balance with the natural world that
   sustains us." The Foundation's priorities are: [95]oceans and
   [96]sustainable fishing, climate change and [97]clean energy,
   [98]sustainability, and David Suzuki's Nature Challenge. He also served
   as a director of the [99]Canadian Civil Liberties Association from
   1982-1987.

Early life

   Suzuki has a twin sister named Marcia, as well as two other siblings,
   Geraldine (now known as Aiko) and Jenny. They were born to Setsu
   Nakamura and Kaoru Carr Suzuki in [112]Vancouver, Canada. Suzuki's
   maternal and paternal grandparents had immigrated to Canada at the
   beginning of the 20th century.

   A third-generation [113]Japanese-Canadian ("Canadian [114]Sansei"),
   Suzuki and his family suffered [115]internment in [116]British Columbia
   during the [117]Second World War from when he was six (1942) until
   after the war ended. In June 1942, the government sold the Suzuki
   family's dry-cleaning business, then interned Suzuki, his mother, and
   two sisters in a camp at [118]Slocan in the [119]British Columbia
   Interior.^[120][1] His father had been sent to a labour camp in Solsqua
   two months earlier. Suzuki's sister, Jenny, was born in the internment
   camp.

   After the war, Suzuki's family, like other Japanese Canadian families,
   was forced to move east of the [121]Rockies. The Suzukis moved to
   [122]Islington, [123]Leamington, and [124]London, [125]Ontario. David
   Suzuki, in interviews, has many times credited his father for having
   interested and sensitized him to nature.

   Suzuki attended Mill Street Elementary School and Grade 9 at Leamington
   Secondary School before moving to London, where he attended [126]London
   Central Secondary School, eventually winning the election to become
   Students' Council President in his last year there by more votes than
   all of the other candidates combined.

Academic career

   Suzuki received his [127]BA from [128]Amherst College in
   [129]Massachusetts in 1958, and his [130]Ph.D in [131]zoology from the
   [132]University of Chicago in 1961.

   Early in his research career he studied [133]genetics, using the
   popular [134]model organism [135]Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies).
   To be able to use his initials in naming any new genes he found, he
   studied [136]Drosophila temperature-sensitive phenotypes (DTS). (As he
   jokingly noted at a lecture at [137]Johns Hopkins University, the only
   alternative was "damn tough skin".) He was a [138]professor in the
   genetics department (stated in his book Genethics: The Ethics of
   Engineering Life, 1988) at the [139]University of British Columbia for
   almost forty years (from 1963 until his retirement in 2001), and has
   since been professor emeritus at a university research
   institute.^[140][2]

   For his work popularizing science and environmental issues, he has been
   presented with 22 [141]honorary degrees.

Broadcasting career

   Suzuki in 2006.

   Suzuki began in television in 1970 with the weekly show [142]Suzuki on
   Science, a children's show. In 1974, he founded the radio programme
   [143]Quirks and Quarks which he also hosted on [144]CBC Radio One from
   1975 to 1979. Throughout the 1970s, he also hosted [145]Science
   Magazine, a weekly programme geared towards an adult audience.

   Since 1979, Suzuki has hosted The Nature of Things, a CBC television
   series that has aired in nearly fifty countries worldwide.^[146][3] In
   this program, Suzuki's aim is to stimulate interest in the natural
   world, to point out threats to human well-being and wildlife habitat,
   and to present alternatives for achieving a more [147]sustainable
   society. Suzuki has been a prominent proponent of [148]renewable energy
   sources and the [149]soft energy path.

   Suzuki was the host of the critically acclaimed 1993 [150]PBS series
   The Secret of Life.^[151][4] His 1985 hit series, A Planet for the
   Taking, averaged more than 1.8 million viewers per episode and earned
   him a [152]United Nations Environment Programme Medal. His perspective
   in this series is summed up in his statement: "We have both a sense of
   the importance of the [153]wilderness and space in our culture and an
   attitude that it is limitless and therefore we needn't worry." He
   concludes with a call for a major "perceptual shift" in our
   relationship with nature and the wild.

   Suzuki's [154]The Sacred Balance, a book first published in 1997 and
   later made into a five hour [155]mini-series on Canadian public
   television, was broadcast in 2002.^[156][5] ^[157][6] Suzuki is now
   taking part in an advertisement campaign with the tagline "You have the
   power", promoting [158]energy conservation through various household
   alternatives, such as the use of [159]compact fluorescent lightbulbs.

   For the Discovery Channel Suzuki also produced "Yellowstone to Yukon:
   The Wildlands Project" in 1997. The conservation-biology based
   documentary focused on [160]Dave Foreman's Wildlands Project, which
   considers how to create corridors between and buffer-zones around large
   wilderness reserves as a means to preserve biological diversity. This
   project Foreman developed after leaving Earth First! (which he
   co-founded) in 1989. The conservation biologists [161]Michael Soul and
   [162]Reed Noss were also directly involved.

Climate change activism

   At the 2007 [163]Global Day of Action event in [164]Vancouver, B.C..
   The sign in the background refers to the [165]Greater Vancouver Gateway
   Program.

   In recent years, Suzuki has been a forceful spokesperson on the subject
   of global [166]climate change. His comments have not always been
   without controversy. In February 2008, Suzuki urged [167]McGill
   University students to speak out against politicians who fail to act on
   climate change and find a way to jail political leaders for ignoring
   science. Suzuki told the students: "What I would challenge you to do is
   to put a lot of effort into trying to see whether there's a legal way
   of throwing our so-called leaders into jail because what they're doing
   is a criminal act." ^[168][7]^[169][8]

   On February 15, 2007, Suzuki was interviewed on [170]Toronto radio
   station [171]AM 640 by morning show host [172]John Oakley. Suzuki
   asserted that Canada should be branded amongst the "international
   outlaws" for reneging on Kyoto agreements, and dismissed as "a lot of
   baloney" Oakley's suggestion that some scientists feel intimidated from
   questioning [173]global warming hypotheses.

   Suzuki said that [174]scientists who deny climate change are "shills"
   for big corporations. He contrasted his own [175]foundation, saying
   that "corporations have not been interested in funding us" and that
   their financial backing comes "from ordinary Canadians".^[176][9] In
   direct contrast to his claim, however, the David Suzuki Foundations
   annual report for 2005/2006 lists at least 52 corporate donors
   including: EnCana Corporation (natural gas production and oil sands
   development), ATCO Gas, Ontario Power Generation Employees and
   Pensioners Charity Trust, Bell Canada, Toyota, IBM, McGraw-Hill
   Ryerson, Microsoft, Scotia Capital, Warner Brothers, RBC, Canon and
   Bank of Montreal.^[177][10]

   Suzuki is unequivocal that climate change is a very real and pressing
   problem and that there is now an "overwhelming majority of scientists"
   who are in agreement that human activity is responsible. The David
   Suzuki Foundation website has a clear statement of this:

     The debate is over about whether or not climate change is real.
     Irrefutable evidence from around the world - including extreme
     weather events, record temperatures, retreating glaciers, and rising
     sea levels - all point to the fact climate change is happening now
     and at rates much faster than previously thought.^[178][11]

     The consensus includes the [179]Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
     Change, consisting of over 2,000 scientists from 100 countries. The
     findings of the panel have been approved by the [180]National
     Academies of Science of each of the [181]G8 countries, along with
     those of [182]China, [183]India and [184]Brazil.^[185][11]

   Suzuki says that despite this growing consensus, many in the public and
   the media seemed doubtful about the science for many years. The reason
   for the confusion about climate change, in Suzuki's view, was due to a
   well-organized campaign of disinformation about the science involved.
   "A very small band of critics" denies that climate change exists and
   that humans are the cause. These climate change skeptics or "deniers,"
   Suzuki claims, tend not to be climate scientists and do not publish in
   peer-reviewed scientific journals but rather target the media, the
   general public, and policy makers. Their goal: "delaying action on
   climate change." According to Suzuki, the skeptics have received
   significant funding from coal and oil companies, including
   [186]ExxonMobil. Suzuki says that they are linked to "industry-funded
   lobby groups to - in the words of one [187]leaked memo 'reposition
   global warming as theory (not fact).'"^[188][11]

   The [189]David Suzuki Foundation has implemented a [190]carbon neutral
   program in its offices. The Foundation states that this is part of its
   "ongoing commitment to sustainability." The program is designed to show
   that "taking responsibility for ones [191]greenhouse gas emissions is
   straightforward and inexpensive," It uses a guide by the [192]World
   Resources Institute to calculate greenhouse gas emissions. Because of
   problems with tree planting projects, the Foundation purchases
   [193]carbon offsets from [194]energy efficiency and [195]renewable
   energy projects.^[196][12] Suzuki himself laments that in traveling
   constantly to spread his message of climate responsibility, he's "over
   his [carbon] limit by hundreds of tonnes." He has stopped vacationing
   overseas and taken to "clustering" his speaking engagements together to
   reduce his carbon footprint. He would prefer, he says, to appear solely
   by video conference.^[197][13]

   In 2007, Suzuki made a cross-country tour in a diesel bus, speaking to
   Canadians about climate change and urging compliance with the
   [198]Kyoto Accord. [199]Gold Standard carbon offsets were purchased by
   the David Suzuki Foundation for all bus travel and tour
   activities.^[200][14] The Foundation's "David Suzuki's Nature
   Challenge"^[201][15] and "David Suzuki's Nature Challenge for
   Kids"^[202][16] suggest simple steps people can take to protect nature
   and improve their quality of life. Suzuki's spokesman said he used the
   diesel bus because using biodiesel would have voided the bus' warranty.
   ^[203][17]

   David Suzuki has given talks to the NDP, Liberal, and Green Parties of
   Canada, but does not belong to any political party. The David Suzuki
   Foundation is non-partisan, in accordance with the rules governing
   non-profit charities in Canada. ^[204][18]

Awards and honours

   Suzuki is the recipient of Canadas most prestigious award, the
   [210]Order of Canada Officer (1976) upgraded to Companion status in
   (2006)^[211][19], the [212]Order of British Columbia (1995)^[213][20],
   [214]UNESCOs [215]Kalinga Prize for science (1986)^[216][21] and a long
   list of Canadian and international honours.

   In 2004, David Suzuki was nominated as one of the top ten
   "[217]Greatest Canadians" by viewers of the CBC. In the final vote he
   finished fifth and therefore ranked as the greatest living
   Canadian.^[218][22] Suzuki said that his own vote was for [219]Tommy
   Douglas who was the eventual winner.

   In 2006, David Suzuki was the recipient of the Bradford Washburn Award
   presented at the Museum of Science in [220]Boston,
   Massachusetts.^[221][23]

Family

   Suzuki was married to Setsuko Joane Sunahara from 1958 to 1965, with
   three children (Tamiko, Laura, and Troy). He married Tara Elizabeth
   Cullis in 1972 and had two daughters: Sarika and [307]Severn
   Cullis-Suzuki. Severn, born in 1979, has also done environmental work,
   including speaking at environmental conferences.

   David Suzuki's [308]Japanese name is Takayoshi Suzuki ( ,Suzuki
   Takayoshi^[309]?) but he is always known by his English name to the
   public, even in Japanese scientific and popular literature (using
   [310]Romaji). Suzuki lives in the [311]Kitsilano area of
   [312]Vancouver.^[313][24]
