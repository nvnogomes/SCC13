   Edward Davis Wood, Jr. (10 October 1924 10 December 1978) was an
   [21]American [22]screenwriter, [23]director, [24]producer, [25]actor,
   [26]author and [27]editor, who often performed many of these functions
   simultaneously. In the 1950s Wood made a run of cheap and poorly
   produced [28]genre films, now humorously celebrated for their technical
   errors, unsophisticated special effects, idiosyncratic dialogue,
   eccentric casts and outlandish plot elements, although his flair for
   showmanship gave his projects at least a modicum of critical success.

   Wood's popularity waned soon after his biggest 'name' star, [29]Bla
   Lugosi, died. He was able to salvage a saleable feature from Lugosi's
   last moments on film, but his career declined thereafter. Toward the
   end of his life, Wood made [30]pornographic movies and wrote [31]pulp
   crime, horror, and sex novels. His posthumous fame began two years
   after his death, when he was awarded a '[32]Golden Turkey Award' as
   Worst Director of All Time.^[33][1] The lack of conventional filmmaking
   ability in his work has earned Wood and his films a considerable
   [34]cult following.

   Following the publication of [35]Rudolph Grey's biography Nightmare of
   Ecstasy, Wood's life and work have undergone a public rehabilitation of
   sorts, with new light shed on his evident zeal and honest love of
   movies and movie production, and [36]Tim Burton's biopic, [37]Ed Wood,
   earned two [38]Academy Awards.

[[56]edit] Early years

   Wood's father, Edward Sr, worked for the [57]Postal Service and his
   family was relocated numerous times around the [58]United States.
   Eventually, they settled in [59]Poughkeepsie, [60]New York where Ed
   Wood, Jr. was born.

   During his childhood, Wood was interested in the performing arts and
   pulp fiction. He collected [61]comics and pulp magazines, and adored
   movies, most notably [62]Westerns and anything involving the
   [63]occult. He would often skip school in favor of watching pictures at
   the local movie theater, where stills from the day's movie would often
   be thrown in the trash by theater staff, allowing Wood to salvage them
   to add to his extensive collection.

   It is believed that Wood's mother, Lillian, always wanted a girl and
   would sometimes, until he was about 12 years old, dress her son in
   skirts and dresses.^[64][2] For the rest of his life, Wood was a
   [65]heterosexual [66]transvestite.

   One of his first paid jobs was as a cinema usher, although he also sang
   and played drums in a band. He later fronted a singing quartet called
   Eddie Wood's Little Splinters, having learned to play a variety of
   string instruments. Wood was given his first movie camera on his 12th
   birthday: a [67]Kodak "Cine Special". One of his first pieces of
   footage was the [68]Hindenburg dirigible passing over the Hudson River
   at Poughkeepsie, just minutes before its [69]famous fiery demise at
   [70]Lakehurst, New Jersey, which imbued him with pride.^[71][3]

   Wood enlisted in the [72]Marines at age 17, just months after the
   [73]Attack on Pearl Harbor. He served from 1942-1946 and claimed that
   he had participated in the [74]Battle of Tarawa while secretly wearing
   a brassiere and panties beneath his uniform.

   Fascinated by the exotic and bizarre, Wood joined a [75]carnival after
   a [76]discharge from the Marines. His several missing teeth and
   disfigured leg (wounds while in combat) combined with personal fetishes
   and acting skills made him a perfect candidate for the [77]freak show.
   Wood played, among others, the geek and the [78]bearded lady. As the
   bearded lady, he donned women's clothing and created his own prosthetic
   [79]breasts. Carnivals would be frequently depicted in Wood's works,
   most notably (and semi-autobiographically) in the novel Killer in Drag.

   Wood's other vices included [80]soft drugs, alcohol, and sex. He was a
   [81]womanizer in his younger days, but in later life he was faithful to
   his girlfriends (most notably [82]Dolores Fuller) and wife (Kathy
   O'Hara). Edward D. Wood Jr. had one child, a daughter named Kathleen
   Emily Wood, who now lives in [83]Modesto under the name Kathleen
   Patterson.

   [87]Cadillac [88]hubcaps for [89]flying saucers in that.^[90][4]

   Ed Wood

   Wood's film career began after moving to Hollywood in 1947. He wrote
   scripts and directed television pilots, commercials, and several
   forgotten micro-budget westerns. Wood wrote, produced, directed, and
   starred in a play called Casual Company^[91][5] from his unpublished
   novel based on his service in the [92]United States Marines that opened
   at the Village Playhouse in Hollywood to disastrous reviews on October
   25, 1948.

[[93]edit] Glen or Glenda

   Wood's 'big break' came in 1953 when he was hired by producer
   [94]George Weiss to make an exploitation film, I Changed My Sex, based
   on the life of transsexual [95]Christine Jorgensen. After Jorgensen
   refused to collaborate on the film, Wood wrote a new autobiographical
   screenplay titled [96]Glen or Glenda, a sincere and sympathetic study
   of [97]transvestism. Wood directed and, using an alias, played the
   titular character who has a fetish for cross-dressing and angora
   sweaters.

   [98]Angora was regularly featured in his films. His wife Kathy O'Hara
   and others recall that Wood's transvestitism was not a sexual
   inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from
   angora fabric ("Ann Gora" also happened to be one of Wood's pen names).
   The medical 'experts' in the film go to great lengths to stress that
   the transvestite is a perfectly normal heterosexual man who simply
   feels more comfortable and "more himself" when wearing women's apparel.
   There is even a fantasy vignette showing Glenda rebuffing the advances
   of a homosexual man. Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about
   going out in public dressed in drag as 'Shirley'; his alter egofemale
   characters named Shirley also appear in many of his screenplays and
   stories.

   Most of Wood's films have a rushed quality due to the tight shooting
   schedule and limited budgets. While most directors film only one scene
   per day (or just a fraction of one in more contemporary pictures), Wood
   might complete up to 30 scenes. He seldom ordered a retake, even if the
   original was obviously flawed. Glen or Glenda, shot in just four days
   for $26,000, was done in a semi-documentary style. Narration and
   voice-over dialog was added to generous amounts of film-library
   [99]stock footage (a cost-saving trick he used in his later films). The
   love-interest role of 'Barbara' was played by Wood's real-life
   girlfriend, Dolores Fuller. She went on to appear in his next two
   films. [100]Bla Lugosi, who was not told the film was about a
   transvestite, was paid $1,000 in cash for one day of filming. In a dark
   haunted-house set, speaking in vague, baffling metaphors and nursery
   rhymes, he played a portentous, omnipotent narrator.

   The centerpiece of the film is an extraordinary 15-minute fantasy
   sequence that illustrates Glen's tormented state of mind. Wood pulls
   out all the stops in a barrage of surreal, dream-like vignettes using
   highly personalized symbolism that defies explanation. Producer George
   Weiss added to the confusion by inserting footage of flagellation and
   bondage reminiscent of the fetish films of [101]Irving Klaw from
   another production. In this sequence Barbara is pinned beneath a large
   tree (in her living room), and Glen rescues her; they are married with
   the [102]Devil acting as best man; a shirtless man vigorously flogs a
   woman reclining on a couch; lewd burlesque dancers gyrate to blaring
   jazz music and tear at their clothes; a woman gagged and bound to a
   yoke-like pole is untied by another gagged woman; a lust-crazed man
   roughly assaults a seductress in a flimsy negligee; an enraged Glenda
   rips Barbara's blouse to shreds after she laughs at his appearance.
   Lugosi appears in several scenes also rejecting Glenda and droning on
   repeatedly about "snips and snails and puppy-dog tails." The film was
   released under several regional titles such as Transvestite, I Led Two
   Lives, and He or She?

[[103]edit] The middle years: Jail Bait and Bride of the Monster

   Wood's next project was a proposed TV series called Dr. Acula, to star
   Lugosi as an investigator into the supernatural. When this fell
   through, he directed and produced the low-budget [104]Jail Bait (1954),
   a 1930s-style gangster film with a twist ending a la [105]The Twilight
   Zone. Originally called The Hidden Face, the title was inexplicably
   changed to Jail Bait, from an offhand reference in the script to an
   illegal hand gun. Wood also co-wrote the screenplay with
   writer-producer friend [106]Alex Gordon. It was Gordon who introduced
   Wood to Bla Lugosi in 1952. (Gordon soon went on to help create
   [107]American International Pictures). Lugosi was originally cast as
   the father of the lead character, but dropped out due to illness.
   Around this time, Wood became friends with a group of B-movie actors
   who became part of his entourage and stock company, appearing in most
   of his later films. These included [108]Kenne Duncan, [109]Lyle Talbot,
   [110]Conrad Brooks, [111]Duke Moore, [112]Timothy Farrell, Swedish
   [113]professional wrestler [114]Tor Johnson, pin-up model and TV horror
   hostess [115]Maila Nurmi (aka [116]Vampira), the eccentric gay
   socialite [117]Bunny Breckinridge, and the [118]psychic [119]Criswell.

   In 1955 he produced and directed his first horror film, [120]Bride of
   the Monster (originally titled Bride of the Atom). Although Wood took
   most of the writing credit, the original story, The Atomic Monster, was
   written by Alex Gordon. Wood contributed about half the dialog,
   according to Gordon (in Starlog, November 1994). Bla Lugosi, in his
   last speaking role, stars as a mad scientist bent on creating an army
   of atomic supermen. The immense, 400-pound Tor Johnson plays "Lobo",
   his lumbering henchman. Billy Benedict of [121]The Bowery Boys has a
   walk-on role as a newspaper seller. The female lead, Loretta King,
   wears the same angora hat worn by Wood in Glen or Glenda.

   The style and content of the film is highly reminiscent of the
   low-budget horror movies Lugosi made for [122]Monogram Pictures in the
   1940s, particularly [123]The Corpse Vanishes. Wood's script even
   recreates a laboratory scene from that film (Lugosi's mad scientist
   flogging his henchman) with the same fake, painted stone wall backdrop.
   Budget-saving film library footage of lightning, explosions, a nuclear
   blast, and a giant "atomic" [124]octopus was also inserted. In one
   scene the hero, trapped in quicksand, is menaced by an obvious stock
   footage alligator. In the finale, the frail, elderly Lugosi was reduced
   to thrashing about in the mud with a large rubber octopus when the
   motor needed to turn it into a flailing beast could not be located.

[[125]edit] Plan 9 from Outer Space

   Wood, in 1956, planned to follow Bride of the Monster with The Ghoul
   Goes West (aka The Phantom Ghoul), which would have been a combination
   of his two favorite genres: Horror and Westerns. The story was mainly a
   rehash of Bride of the Monster in a western setting (a synopsis of the
   screenplay was published in Filmfax no. 18, Dec./Jan. 1989-90). Lugosi,
   recently out of rehab for morphine addiction, was to star as the
   undertaker/mad scientist. [126]Gene Autry and [127]Lon Chaney, Jr. were
   also attached to the project for a time. Wood could only raise enough
   money to shoot one day's worth of silent test footage. A few random
   scenes were filmed of Lugosi at a funeral, in front of Tor Johnson's
   house, and stalking about in his Dracula costume (possibly intended for
   The Vampire's Tomb, another unrealized film). The scenes were filmed to
   show to prospective financial backers. Lugosi died soon afterwards on
   August 16 and the footage became the seed for Wood's next project.

   [128]Plan 9 from Outer Space incorporated the final Lugosi scenes into
   a new story that combined horror and science fiction. Wood's
   chiropractor, his face hidden behind a cape, doubled for Lugosi in
   several scenes. Tor Johnson and wasp-waisted Vampira (Maila Nurmi) are
   memorable, even iconic, as zombies risen from the grave by alien
   invaders. The film was shot over a five-day period in November 1956 on
   a budget of around $20,000. All of Nurmi's scenes were filmed in just
   two hours (she was paid the union minimum wage of $200). Resorting
   again to the "docu-fantasy" approach, Criswell, the flamboyantly
   inaccurate TV psychic, acts as on-screen host and narrator. He
   cryptically describes the story as "something more than a fact."
   Cost-free stock footage of airliners, explosions, and fighter jets were
   edited in. The [129]flying saucersmade from plastic toy store modelsare
   fired upon by an artillery barrage taken from World War II newsreels.
   Although completed in 1956, the film was not released until 1959, due
   to the inability of the producer to secure distribution.

   Most notably, for Plan 9, he convinced members of the [130]Southern
   Baptist church (through his landlord at the time) to invest the initial
   capital, allegedly convincing them that a successful science fiction
   picture would make enough money to fund their own pet project of 12
   movies about the 12 Apostles. They reportedly changed the name of the
   movie from Grave Robbers from Outer Space and removed lines from the
   script which they considered profane; one source alleges they required
   the actors to accept their Church's baptism as part of the deal. The
   grave-diggers in the picture are the two primary backers. Wood's
   frequently being overruled by producers and financiers was one factor
   contributing to his depression and was something he personally blamed
   for his lack of commercial success.^[131][2]

[[132]edit] The later years: exploitation films

   Also in 1956, Wood's Teenage Girl Gang script was produced as [133]The
   Violent Years, an [134]exploitation film about a gang of juvenile
   delinquent high school girls. Directed by William M. Morgan, it starred
   first-time actress [135]Jean Moorhead, a former [136]Playboy Miss
   October 1955 centerfold model. The film is notable for its unusual
   girls-gone-bad premise and risqu abduction scene where a girl is bound
   and gagged with strips of her shredded dress while her boyfriend is
   sexually assaulted (off camera) by the lusty girl gang. This
   foreshadows Wood's fearless, anything-goes attitude seen in his later,
   more racy novels and films.

   In 1958, Wood's screenplay Queen of the Gorillas was released as The
   Bride and the Beast, a fantasy tale about a gorilla reincarnated in the
   body of a beautiful woman. That same year Wood wrote, produced, and
   directed [137]Night of the Ghouls (original title: Revenge of the
   Dead), an "old dark house" tale about a fake medium and evil spirits.
   The setting is the rebuilt house on Willows Lake that burned down in
   [138]Bride of the Monster. There are frequent references to the mad
   scientist (Lugosi) and monster from the previous film, and Tor Johnson
   reprises his 'Lobo' rolehis face now half-destroyed from the fire. Paul
   Marco makes his third appearance as 'Kelton', the cowardly, inept
   policeman. Criswell, billed as himself, returns as host and narrator,
   rising from his coffin to introduce this tale of "Monsters to be
   pitied. Monsters to be despised!" (Tim Burton's [139]Ed Wood bio-pic
   opens with a faithful recreation of this scene). Criswell also plays a
   character role as one of the vengeful ghosts seen at the climax of the
   film.

   In one of the early scenes, a girl (wearing an angora sweater) and her
   boyfriend are attacked by the "Black Ghost". Wood, his face hidden by a
   dark veil, doubles for the female ghoul in several shots. A fight scene
   from the unfinished Hellborn was edited in (more scenes from that
   project appeared in The Sinister Urge). Most of Lieutenant Bradford's
   exploration of Dr. Acula's house was lifted from Wood's short film
   Final Curtain and given a voice-over by Criswell to integrate it into
   the current story. A publicity photo of Wood is seen on a wanted poster
   on the wall of the police station. The finale, with the ghouls reduced
   to skeletons and Criswell's epilogue, were used again in 1965 for Orgy
   of the Dead. For decades this remained a 'lost' film that was never
   released to theaters. Wood lacked the funds to pay the film processing
   fees, so it languished in limbo until it was finally released on video
   in 1983.

[[140]edit] The final years: scriptwriting and adult films

   In 1961, Wood worked on the script for another potboiler, Married Too
   Young, and wrote and directed [141]The Sinister Urge from his Racket
   Queen script. This lurid expos on the "smut picture racket" purports to
   warn against the dangers of pornography. The story concerns a police
   man hunt for a sex maniac psycho-killer. The police are played by Wood
   regulars Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore, and Carl Anthony. Filmed in five
   days in 1960, this is the last mainstream film that Wood directed.
   Ironically, his career would soon spiral downward into a blur of 'smut
   racket' nudie flicks, softcore pornography, and end with X-rated novels
   and films.

   In 1963 he wrote the screenplay for Shotgun Wedding, an exploitation
   film about hillbillies marrying child brides. Wood's transitional film,
   once again combining two genres, horror and grindhouse skin-flick, was
   [142]Orgy of the Dead (1965). Wood wrote the screenplay, originally
   called Nudie Ghoulies, and handled various production details while
   [143]Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A.C. Stephen.
   The film begins with a recreation of the opening scene from the then
   unreleased Night of the Ghouls. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old
   capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost
   word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the
   Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, The Black Ghoul (a
   Vampira lookalike) preside over a series of macabre performances by
   topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local
   strip clubs). Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of
   sexploitation flicks up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and
   occasionally acted.

   His remaining output until his death in 1978 was confined to writing
   lurid crime and sex novels, often featuring girl gangs and
   transvestites, and a dozen obscure, low-budget adult films, some with
   an occult theme. Titles include: The Photographer (1969), Take it Out
   in Trade (1970), The Only House in Town (1970), with [144]Uschi Digard,
   [145]Necromania (1971), The Undergraduate (1972), and Fugitive Girls
   (1974). As told in Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D.
   Wood, Jr., (p.135) Maila Nurmi declined Wood's offer to do a nude scene
   sitting up in a coffin for Necromania.

[[146]edit] A summing-up

   One of Wood's heroes was [147]Orson Welles for his cinematic ambition
   and passion. Wood also prided himself on the fact that he was the only
   filmmaker other than Welles to be [148]writer, director, and actor in
   his own films, although it is likely that Wood took on all of these
   functions to save time and money. Unlike his counterpart in Tim
   Burton's Ed Wood, however, Wood never actually met his hero. A bit of
   trivia is that Wood was born on the same date (October 10-but in a
   different year) that Welles died.

   Bla Lugosi, Jr. has been among those who felt Wood exploited Lugosi's
   stardom, taking advantage of the fading actor when he could not refuse
   any work.^[149][6] Most documents and interviews with other Wood
   associates in Nightmare of Ecstasy suggest that Wood and Lugosi were
   genuine friends and that Wood helped Lugosi through the worst days of
   his [150]depression and [151]addiction.

[[152]edit] Documentaries

     * Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion, was released
       in 1992. This exhaustive two-hour documentary by Mark Carducci
       chronicles the making of Plan 9 from Outer Space and features
       interviews with Maila Nurmi (Vampira), Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks,
       et al. In 2000, Image Entertainment included the documentary on the
       DVD reissue of Plan 9 from Outer Space (in a two-disc set with
       [153]Robot Monster).

     * Ed Wood: Look Back In Angora, released in 1994 by Rhino Home Video,
       is a one-hour documentary on Wood's life and films. This includes
       rare outtakes and interviews with Dolores Fuller, Kathy Wood,
       Stephen Apostolof, and Conrad Brooks.

     * The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood Jr., written and directed by
       Brett Thompson, came out in 1995. This documentary about the life
       and films of Ed Wood features interviews with Wood's friends and
       co-workers.

[[154]edit] Lost films

          See also: [155]Lost film

   Edward D. Wood, Jr.'s (1972) film The Undergraduate is considered lost
   along with his 1970 film Take It Out In Trade, which exists only in
   [156]outtakes without sound (released by [157]Something Weird Video).
   Wood's 1971 film [158]Necromania was believed lost for years until an
   edited version resurfaced at a yard sale in 1992, followed by a
   complete unedited print in 2001. A complete print of the previously
   lost Wood pornographic film [159]The Young Marrieds was discovered in
   2004.

[[160]edit] Wood as author

   From the 1950s onward, Wood supplemented his directing and
   screenwriting income with hastily written pulp fiction, including
   innumerable pulp crime, horror, and sex novels and occasional
   [161]non-fiction pieces. As he became increasingly unable to fund film
   projects, the novels seem to have become Wood's primary source of
   income.

   Wood's novels frequently include [162]transvestite or [163]drag queen
   characters, or entire plots centering around [164]transvestism
   (including his angora [165]fetish), and tap into his love of crime
   fiction and the occult. Wood would often recycle plots of his films for
   novels, write [166]novelizations of his own screenplays, or reuse
   elements from his novels in scripts. His first novel, Black Lace Drag
   was published in 1963 and reissued in 1965 as Killer in Drag. Among his
   other books are Orgy of The Dead (1965), Devil Girls (1967), Death of a
   Transvestite (1967), The Sexecutives (1968) and A Study of Fetishes and
   Fantasies (1973).

   Descriptions of Wood's working methods in Nightmare of Ecstasy indicate
   he would work on a dozen projects at once, simultaneously watching
   television, eating, drinking, and carrying on conversations while
   typing. In his quasi-memoir, Hollywood Rat Race, Wood advises new
   writers to "just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, you'll
   get better."

   As Wood's most famous films of the 1950s are not explicitly sexual or
   violent, the outr content of his novels may shock the unprepared
   reader. Wood's dark side emerges in such sexual shockers as Raped in
   the Grass or The Perverts and in short stories such as Toni: Black
   Tigress, which exploit hot-button topics like violence, rape, racial
   issues, [167]juvenile delinquency and [168]drug culture.

   Some of Wood's books remained unpublished during his lifetime.
   Hollywood Rat Race, for example, was written in 1965 and finally
   published in 1998. The nonfiction book is part primer for young actors
   and filmmakers, and part memoir. In Rat Race, Wood recounts tales of
   dubious authenticity, such as how he and Lugosi entered the world of
   nightclub [169]cabaret.

[[170]edit] Last days

   Wood had serious financial difficulties in his final years, often
   producing full movie scripts for as little as $100 in order to make
   ends meet. His career as a director had degenerated into making
   pornographic films such as [171]Necromania (1971) and Take It Out In
   Trade, a softcore take on the [172]Philip Marlowe detective films. Wood
   also made occasional appearances as an actor, appearing in two films
   produced by a Marine buddy, Joseph F. Robertson. Love Feast (1969),
   also known as Pretty Models All In A Row, was his first lead role in a
   film since Glen or Glenda, as a photographer using his position to
   engage in sexual antics with professional models. He had a smaller role
   in Robertson's ode to [173]swinger parties, Mrs. Stone's Thing. Wood
   appeared as a transvestite who spends his time at a party trying on
   lingerie in a bedroom. In Rudolph Grey's Nightmare of Ecstasy,
   Robertson makes a reference to Wood reappearing in a film called Misty,
   of which no other record remains.

   His primary film work in the 1970s was working with friend [174]Stephen
   C. Apostolof, usually cowriting scripts, but also serving as an
   assistant director and associate producer. His last known on-screen
   appearance was in Apostolof's Fugitive Girls (aka Five Loose Women),
   where he played a dual cameo as a gas station attendant called Pops and
   as the sheriff on the women's trail.

   Wood's depression worsened, and with it a serious drinking problem.
   Evicted from his Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street, Wood and his wife
   moved into the North Hollywood apartment of friend Peter Coe. On
   December 10, 1978, only days after the move, the 54-year old Edward D.
   Wood died of a [175]heart attack while watching a football game alone
   in Coe's bedroom. In Nightmare of Ecstasy, it was reported Wood yelled
   out "Kathy, I can't breathe!", a plea his wife in the living room
   ignored for 90 minutes before finally going in to find him dead;
   apparently, he frequently feigned heart attacks and screamed for help
   as a way of teasing her, and at one point she even shouted at him to
   shut up.

   Wood's wife Kathy died on June 26, 2006, having never remarried. Edward
   was cremated. His ashes were scattered at sea.

[[176]edit] Tim Burton's Ed Wood (1994)

          Main article: [177]Ed Wood (film)

   The 1994 film Ed Wood, by director Tim Burton, tells the story of Wood
   and Lugosi and the making of their three films, (Glen or Glenda, Bride
   of the Monster, and Plan 9 from Outer Space), from a sympathetic point
   of view. Wood was played by [178]Johnny Depp and Lugosi by [179]Martin
   Landau, who won an [180]Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The
   film also won an [181]Academy Award for Best Makeup for [182]Rick
   Baker. Burton's successes for previous studios like [183]Warner Bros.
   and [184]20th Century Fox were at odds with his insistence to shoot the
   Wood film in [185]black-and-white, and the studios turned it down as a
   probable [186]box office failure. Eager to embrace Burton, [187]Disney
   accepted the project, monochrome and all. As others had anticipated,
   the film received mass critical acclaim, but did poorly at the box
   office. It has since become a cult hit on video and [188]DVD.

[[189]edit] Cult status

   Among connoisseurs of [190]kitsch and bad cinema, Ed Wood is revered as
   the ultimate 'bad' director of all time. His cult status began two
   years after his death with his recognition in the [191]Michael and
   Harry Medved book [192]The Golden Turkey Awards, and has continued with
   the rediscovery of many of his long-lost works. In an essay paying
   homage to Wood in [193]Incredibly Strange Films, Jim Morton writes:
   "Eccentric and individualistic, Edward D Wood Jr was a man born to
   film. Lesser men, if forced to make movies under the conditions Wood
   faced, would have thrown up their hands in defeat."

   The [194]University of Southern California holds an annual "Ed Wood
   Film Festival", in which students of all disciplines are challenged to
   form teams to write, film and edit an Ed Wood-inspired short film based
   on a preassigned theme. Past themes have included "Slippery When Wet"
   (2006), "What's That In Your Pocket?" (2005), and "Rebel Without A Bra"
   (2004). 2007 saw a break in this tradition when the theme "My eyes are
   killing me" was accompanied by a theme object: a mirror.

   Some of Wood's most famous films, including Glen or Glenda? and Plan 9
   From Outer Space have been remade as [195]pornographic movies (as Glen
   & Glenda and Plan 69 From Outer Space, respectively). They were not
   simply spoofed or referenced, but reshot, with the same or similar
   script, and sex scenes worked into the original plots.

   In 1998, Wood's previously unfilmed script [196]I Woke Up Early The Day
   I Died was finally produced, starring [197]Billy Zane and
   [198]Christina Ricci, and has preserved the inept, goofy character that
   made Wood's films famous. Outside of a brief New York theatrical
   engagement, the film did not receive a commercial release in the United
   States, and was only available on video in Germany due to contractual
   difficulties.

   Three of his films (Bride of the Monster, The Violent Years, and The
   Sinister Urge) have been featured on the television series [199]Mystery
   Science Theater 3000, which has given those works wider exposure.
   Producers considered including Plan 9, but found it had too much
   dialogue for the show's format. Series head writer and host
   [200]Michael J. Nelson would go on to do an audio commentary for a
   2005/2006 DVD release of the film, which was newly colorized.

   Reverend Steve Galindo of [201]Sacramento, California, created a
   legally recognized religion in 1996 with Wood as its official savior.
   The Church of Ed Wood^[202][7] now boasts over 3,500 legally baptized
   followers. Woodites, as Steve's followers are called, celebrate Woodmas
   on October 10, which is Ed's birthday. It is the Ed Wood Christmas.
   Numerous parties and concerts are held worldwide to celebrate Woodmas.

   The cult status of Ed Wood's movies is also represented in the music
   industry. Horror film director and heavy metal musician [203]Rob Zombie
   titled his 2001 album "[204]The Sinister Urge" after [205]Wood's film.
