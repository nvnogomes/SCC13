   Operated by [9]Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation

   Edgar Evins State Park is a [10]state park in [11]DeKalb County,
   Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. The park consists of
   6,000 acres (24 km^2) along the shores of [12]Center Hill Lake, an
   [13]impoundment of the [14]Caney Fork River. The State of Tennessee
   leases the land from the [15]U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

   James Edgar Evins (1883-1954), the park's namesake, was a
   [16]Smithville businessman and [17]state senator who played a vital
   role in the development of the Center Hill Dam and Reservoir in the
   1940s. He was the father of former [18]United States Representative
   [19]Joe L. Evins, for whom the nearby Joe L. Evins Appalachian Center
   for Craft is named. The Evins family began pushing for the
   establishment of a state park along the DeKalb portion of Center Hill
   Lake as early as the 1950s.

[[26]edit] Geographical setting

   Center Hill Lake, viewed from a limestone bluff near the primitive
   campground

   The Caney Fork River flows down from its source atop the Cumberland
   Plateau and winds its way northwestward across the Eastern [27]Highland
   Rim before emptying into the [28]Cumberland River near [29]Carthage,
   Tennessee. Center Hill Dam, located approximately 26.6 miles (42.8 km)
   above the mouth of the Caney Fork, has created a reservoir that spans a
   68-mile (109 km) stretch of the river between the dam and the [30]Great
   Falls Dam at [31]Rock Island State Park in adjacent [32]Warren County.
   Edgar Evins State Park covers the northeast shore of the reservoir
   immediately upstream from Center Hill Dam.

   The park is situated amidst rolling hills ("knobs") that comprise part
   of the geological boundary between the Eastern [33]Highland Rim and the
   [34]Central Basin. These hills are typically underlain by
   [35]Mississippian period [36]limestone, the erosion of which has
   created [37]karst-like formations throughout the Center Hill
   Basin.^[38][1] Outcroppings of this limestone are visible along the
   cliffs overlooking the lake.

   Most of Edgar Evins State Park is coated in a second-growth hardwood
   forest typical of the Eastern Highland Rim. Common tree species include
   the [39]tuliptree, white [40]basswood, [41]sugar maple, [42]white ash,
   and various species of oak and hickory.^[43][2]

[[44]edit] History

   Dunham Cemetery

   A pre-inundation archaeological survey of the Center Hill Basin
   conducted by the [45]Smithsonian Institution located several possible
   prehistoric village and mound sites, including a 10-foot (3.0 m)
   platform mound at the mouth of Mine Lick Creek, just upstream from the
   modern park boundary.^[46][3] Early settlers in the area also claimed
   to have found [47]Native American graves and other objects.^[48][4]
   More extensive excavations, however, failed to uncover any major
   prehistoric sites.^[49][5]

   The earliest Euro-American settlers in the DeKalb area arrived in the
   late 1790s and established the town of [50]Liberty just west of the
   modern park.^[51][6] Over the years, several families settled in the
   hollows and valleys of what is now Edgar Evins State Park and adjacent
   lands that would eventually be inundated by Center Hill Lake. One such
   settler, Alexander Dunham (1826-1878), whose family arrived in the area
   in the 1830s, is buried on a hill within the park that overlooks Center
   Hill Lake. Dunham's son lived near the present site of Center Hill
   Dam.^[52][7]

   The Caney Fork River has long been notorious for its volatility. In the
   late 1800s and early 1900s, business venture after business venture
   tried to harness the river's power, only to be defeated by one of
   several catastrophic floods that occurred along the river during this
   period.^[53][8] Major floods in 1902, 1915, 1928, and 1929 wiped out
   mills, bridges, houses, and farms, and led to increased calls for flood
   control. In the 1930s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers initiated
   several flood control projects in the [54]Cumberland River watershed,
   including Center Hill Dam, the construction of which was authorized in
   1938. Flood control and power production were the primary goals of the
   Center Hill Dam project.^[55][9]

   Center Hill Lake's revised management plan in the 1940s called for the
   inclusion of recreational areas along the lake's shores. These included
   several small local parks and boatramps at first.^[56][10] In the late
   1960s, the State of Tennessee began construction of facilities for
   Edgar Evins State Park. The park was officially dedicated in 1975.

[[57]edit] The park today

   Park office and observation tower

   Edgar Evins State Park maintains a 300-slip marina and full service
   dock. Various types of watercraft may be rented at the marina. Lodging
   areas include a 34-cabin lodging complex and a campground with both
   modern and primitive campsites.

   Hiking trails maintained by the park include the 2-mile (3.2 km)
   Highland Rim Trail, which loops down, around, and back up through a
   hillside forest characteristic of the Eastern Highland Rim, and the
   Dunham Cemetery Trail, a short trail that ascends to a small cemetery
   where former resident Alexander Dunham and two of his children are
   buried (as of 2008, the trail was slated for expansion). The Millennium
   Trail consists of a 2.2-mile (3.5 km) loop that descends to the shores
   of Center Hill Lake and passes several pre-1940s homesteads (most of
   the ruins consist of rockwall-fences) before looping back into the
   forest. The Merritt Ridge Trail, a 5-mile (8.0 km) extension of the
   Millennium Trail, traverses Merritt Ridge, a steep ridge that became a
   peninsula with the reservoir's creation.^[58][11]

   The Friends of Edgar Evins State Park was organized in 2003 to support
   park preservation efforts. The group conducts several annual tours of
   the park's flora, lake, and waterfalls.^[59][12]
