Drosophila embryogenesis

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Drosophila has long been a favorite [8]model system for [9]geneticists
   and [10]developmental biologists studying [11]embryogenesis. The small
   size, short generation time, and large brood size makes it ideal for
   genetic studies. Transparent embryos facilitate developmental studies.
   [12]Drosophila melanogaster was introduced into the field of genetic
   experiments by [13]Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1909.

[[22]edit] Life cycle

   Drosophila display a holometabolous method of development, meaning that
   they have three distinct stages of their post-embryonic life cycle,
   each with radically different body plans: larva, pupa and finally,
   adult. The machinery necessary for the function and smooth transition
   between these three phases develops during embryogenesis. During
   [23]embryogenesis, the larval stage fly will develop and will hatch at
   a stage of its life known as the first larval instar. Cells that will
   produce adult structures are put aside in [24]imaginal discs. During
   the pupal stage, the larval body breaks down as the imaginal disks grow
   and produce the adult body. This process is called complete
   [25]metamorphosis.

   The mother fly produces [26]oocytes that already have
   anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes defined by maternal
   activities.

   Embryogenesis in Drosophila is unique among model organisms in that
   cleavage occurs in a [27]syncytium. About 5,000 nuclei accumulate in
   the unseparated cytoplasm of the oocyte before they migrate to the
   surface and are encompassed by plasma membranes to form cells
   surrounding the yolk sac. Early on, the [28]germ line segregates from
   the somatic cells through the formation of pole cells at the posterior
   end of the embryo.

   Like other [29]triploblastic [30]metazoa, [31]gastrulation leads to the
   formation of three [32]germ layers: the endoderm, mesoderm, and
   ectoderm. The mesoderm invaginates from the ventral furrow (VF), as do
   the ectoderm that will give rise to the midgut. The pole cells are
   internalized by a different route.

   Germ band elongation involves many rearrangements of cells, and the
   appearance of distinct differences in the cells of the three germ bands
   and various regions of the embryo. The posterior region (including the
   hindgut) expands and extends towards the anterior pole along the dorsal
   side of the embryo. The earliest signs of segmentation appear during
   this phase with the formation of parasegmental furrows. This is also
   when the tracheal pits form, the first signs of structures for
   breathing.

   Germ band retraction returns the hindgut to the dorsal side of the
   posterior pole and coincides with overt [33]segmentation. The remaining
   stages involve the internalization of the nervous system (ectoderm) and
   the formation of internal organs (mainly mesoderm).

[[34]edit] Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila

   One of the best understood examples of pattern formation is the
   patterning along the future head to tail (antero-posterior) axis of the
   fruit fly [35]Drosophila melanogaster. The development of Drosophila is
   particularly well studied, and it is representative of a major class of
   animals, the insects or [36]insecta. Other multicellular organisms
   sometimes use similar mechanisms for axis formation, although the
   relative importance of signal transfer between the earliest cells of
   many developing organisms is greater than in the example described
   here.

[[37]edit] Maternal effect genes

          Further information: [38]Maternal effect

   Figure 1. mRNA distributions.
   Figure 2. Protein distributions.

   The building-blocks of anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila
   are laid out during egg formation ([39]oogenesis), well before the egg
   is fertilized and deposited. The developing egg ([40]oocyte) is
   polarized by differentially localized [41]mRNA molecules.

   The genes that code for these mRNAs, called maternal effect genes,
   encode for proteins that get translated upon fertilization to establish
   concentration gradients that span the egg. Bicoid and hunchback are the
   maternal effect genes that are most important for patterning of
   anterior parts (head and thorax) of the Drosophila embryo. Nanos and
   Caudal are maternal effect genes that are important in the formation of
   more posterior abdominal segments of the Drosophila embryo.

   [42]Cytoskeletal elements such as [43]microtubules are polarized within
   the oocyte and can be used to allow the localization of mRNA molecules
   to specific parts of the cell. Maternally synthesized bicoid mRNAs
   attach to microtubules and are concentrated at the anterior ends of
   forming Drosophila eggs. In unfertilized eggs, transcripts are still
   strictly localized at the tip. However, a recent report (Spirov et al.,
   Development 136, 605-614, (2009)) has shown that immediately after
   fertilization, an mRNA gradient is formed, due to the release of the
   mRNA from the tip and proposed quasi-random active transport along a
   peripheral network of microtubuli, aided by the Staufen protein.
   Notably, an mRNA gradient was already demonstrated in 1986 to exist,
   but was largely ignored. Figure 1 to the right is therefore incorrect
   and needs an update: the bicoid mRNA is distrubuted as shown in Figure
   2, i. e. the mRNA and protein gradients are virtually identical. Nanos
   mRNAs also attach to the egg cytoskeleton but they concentrate at the
   posterior ends of the eggs. Hunchback and caudal mRNAs lack special
   location control systems and are fairly evenly spread throughout the
   interior of egg cells.

   When the mRNAs from the maternal effect genes are [44]translated into
   proteins a Bicoid protein gradient forms at the anterior end of the
   egg. Nanos protein forms a gradient at the posterior end. The Bicoid
   protein blocks translation of caudal mRNA so Caudal protein is made
   only in the posterior part of the cell. Nanos protein binds to the
   hunchback mRNA and blocks its translation in the posterior end of
   Drosophila embryos.

   The Bicoid, Hunchback, and Caudal proteins are [45]transcription
   factors. Bicoid has a DNA-binding [46]homeodomain that binds both DNA
   and the nanos mRNA. Bicoid binds a specific RNA sequence in the [47]3'
   untranslated region of caudal mRNA and blocks translation.

   Hunchback protein levels in the early embryo are significantly
   augmented by new hunchback gene transcription and translation of the
   resulting [48]zygotically produced mRNA. During early Drosophila
   embryogenesis there are nuclear divisions without cell division. The
   many nuclei that are produced distribute themselves around the
   periphery of the cell cytoplasm. Gene expression in these nuclei is
   regulated by the Bicoid, Hunchback, and Caudal proteins. For example,
   Bicoid acts as a transcriptional activator of hunchback gene
   transcription.
   Figure 3. bicoid gradient
   Figure 4. nanos gradient

[[49]edit] Gap genes

   Figure 5. Gap genes.

   The other important function of the gradients of Bicoid, Hunchback, and
   Caudal proteins is in the transcriptional regulation of other
   zygotically expressed proteins. Many of these are the protein products
   derived from members of the "gap" family of developmental control
   genes. Hunchback, krppel, giant, tailless and knirps are all gap genes.
   Their expression patterns in the early embryo are determined by the
   maternal effect gene products and shown in the diagrams on the right
   side of this page. The gap genes are part of a larger family called the
   segmentation genes. These genes establish the segmented body plan of
   the embryo along the anterior-posterior axis. The segmentation genes
   specify 14 "parasegments" that are closely related to the final
   anatomical segments. The gap genes are the first layer of a
   hierarchical cascade of the segmentation control genes.

   Proteins such as Bicoid can be described as morphogens that act within
   the [50]syncytial blastoderm of the early Drosophila embryo. These
   intracellular morphogens enter the nuclei and act as transcription
   factors to control expression of the gap genes.

   In the blastoderm stage of Drosophila morphogenesis four types of
   nuclear specification can be distinguished:
     * Anterior (head and thorax)
     * Posterior (abdomen)
     * [51]Dorso-[52]ventral
     * Terminal (special structures at the unsegmented ends of the embryo)

[[53]edit] Additional segmentation genes

   Figure 6. Pair rule.

   Two additional classes of segmentation genes are expressed after the
   gap gene products. The pair-rule genes are expressed in striped
   patterns of seven bands perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis
   (see Figure 6, even-skipped). These patterns of expression are
   established within the syncytial blastoderm. After these initial
   patterning events, cell membranes form around the nuclei of the
   syncytial blastoderm converting it to a cellular blastoderm.
   Figure 7. Reciprocal signaling between Wingless and Hedgehog producing
   cells.

   The expression patterns of the final class of segmentation genes, the
   segment polarity genes, are then fine-tuned by interactions between the
   cells of adjacent parasegments (see the example, engrailed, Figure 7).
   The Engrailed protein is a transcription factor (yellow in Figure 7)
   that is expressed in one row of cells at the edge of each parasegment.
   This expression pattern is initiated by the pair-rule genes (like
   even-skipped) that code for transcription factors that regulate the
   engrailed gene's transcription in the syncytial blastoderm.

   Cells that make Engrailed can make the cell-to-cell signaling protein
   [54]Hedgehog (green in Figure 7). Hedgehog is not free to move very far
   and activates a thin stripe of cells adjacent to the
   Engrailed-expressing cells. Only cells to one side of the
   Engrailed-expressing cells are competent to respond to Hedgehog because
   they express the receptor protein Patched (blue in Figure 7). Cells
   with activated Patch receptor make the Wingless protein (red in Figure
   7). Wingless protein acts on the adjacent rows of cells by activating
   its cell surface receptor, Frizzled.

   Wingless also acts on Engrailed-expressing cells to stabilize Engrailed
   expression after the cellular blastoderm forms. The reciprocal
   signaling by Hedgehog and Wingless stabilizes the boundary between each
   segment. The Wingless protein is called "wingless" because of the
   [55]phenotype of some wingless mutants. Wingless also functioned during
   [56]metamorphosis to coordinate wing formation.

   The transcription factors that are coded for by segmentation genes
   regulate yet another family of developmental control genes, the
   homeotic selector genes. These genes exist in two ordered groups on
   Drosophila chromosome 3. The order of the genes on the chromosome
   reflects the order that they are expressed along the anterior-posterior
   axis of the developing embryo. The Antennapedia group of homeotic
   selector genes includes labial, antennapedia, sex combs reduced,
   deformed, and proboscipedia. Labial and Deformed proteins are expressed
   in head segments where they activate the genes that define head
   features. Sex-combs-reduced and Antennapedia specify the properties of
   thoracic segments. The bithorax group of homeotic selector genes
   control the specializations of the third thoracic segment and the
   abdominal segments.

   In 1995, the [57]Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded for
   studies concerning the genetic control of early embryonic development
   to [58]Christiane Nsslein-Volhard, [59]Edward B. Lewis and [60]Eric
   Wieschaus. Their researches on genetic screening for embryo patterning
   mutants revealed the role played in early embryologic development by
   [61]Homeobox genes like bicoid. An example of a homeotic mutation is
   the so-called antennapedia mutation. In Drosophila, antennae and legs
   are created by the same basic "program", they only differ in a single
   transcription factor. If this transcription factor is damaged, the fly
   grows legs on its head instead of antennae. See images of this
   "antennapedia" mutant and others, at [62]FlyBase.

[[63]edit] Tools

   [64]Mutagenesis allow scientists to disrupt the function of genes in
   the fly. This is useful for studying embryogenosis.

   It is fairly easy for an experienced scientist to make [65]transgenic
   flies. This is a very useful tool and opens up many possibilities. It
   allows the study of the role of the gene in embryogenosis.

   It is possible to tag a fly protein with a fluorescent protein such as
   [66]green fluorescent protein (GFP). This means that you can watch the
   dynamics of the localisation of that protein. It is even possible to do
   so in living organisms.

   The fly genome has been published and is an extremely useful resource.
   It can be used to look for the [67]homolog of genes from other
   organisms, that are involved in embryogenosis. Once such a gene has
   been identified in fly it will make the study of its function possible
   and increase the understanding of the role of the gene product.
