   The Duke of Roxburgh

   The Duke of Roxburgh was a mid 19th century timber hulled merchant
   barque of 498 tons registered in London and sailing between Great
   Britain and the Australasian Colonies. The Duke of Roxburgh was one of
   the earliest immigrant ships to [9]Port Phillip, [10]South Australia
   and [11]New Zealand.

   Voyages included London ([12]12 April [13]1838) to South Australia
   ([14]28 July [15]1838) and [16]Plymouth ([17]5 October [18]1839) to
   [19]Wellington ([20]8 February [21]1840) under James Thomson, Master,
   being one of the first fleet of immigrant ships to [22]Wellington.

   On 1 August 1841 she again left London, landing at Cork on 1 September
   and then arriving at Sydney on 10 January 1842. On board were 105 male
   and 142 female passengers, predominantly emigrants.

   On [23]7 May [24]1843 the Duke, as she was affectionately known by crew
   and passengers, sailed under Captain Collard from England with
   [25]Francis Russell Nixon, the first [26]Bishop of Tasmania, his wife
   and family, and [27]Archdeacon [28]Fitzherbert Marriott, together with
   6 other cabin passenger including [29]John Helder Wedge and the future
   squatter [30]Henry Godfrey. Sailing via [31]Trinidad, [32]Ascension
   Island, [33]Cape Colony, the Duke reached [34]Hobart Town, [35]Van
   Diemens Land, on [36]21 July [37]1843.

   She left [38]Hobart Town the following January and arrived at
   [39]Gravesend on [40]5 June [41]1844.

   The Duke of Roxburgh sailed again from [42]Gravesend on [43]31 October
   [44]1846 and arrived at [45]Port Phillip on [46]7 March [47]1847.

   The fate of the ship is unknown.
