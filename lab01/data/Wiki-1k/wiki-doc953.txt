[[40]edit] Politics

   Natapei was first elected to Parliament in 1983. In 1996, he was
   elected as Speaker of Parliament, and in 1999 he was elected as
   President of Vanua'aku Pati.^[41][2] In a parliamentary vote on 25
   November 1999, Natapei was a candidate for the position of Prime
   Minister, but was defeated by [42]Barak Sop, receiving 24 votes against
   28 for Sope.^[43][3] When Sop lost a [44]vote of no confidence, Natapei
   became Prime Minister on 13 April 2001, receiving 27 votes in
   parliament, with one vote against him.^[45][4] He retained the position
   after the May 2002 election.^[46][5] Even though his party performed
   poorly in the July 2004 election, he was re-elected as a Member of
   Parliament for Port Vila Constituency with the highest number of votes.
   He supported [47]Ham Lini for the post of Prime Minister, but Lini was
   defeated; however, [48]Serge Vohor was ousted in a [49]motion of no
   confidence and Ham Lini was elected Prime Minister. Being Vanua'aku
   Party President entitled Natapei to the post of Speaker of the House,
   which he declined and relegated to [50]Sam Dan Avock, who was a Party
   Executive Member.

   Natapei became Minister for Infrastructure and Public Utilities in the
   Lini-led government in July 2005.^[51][2] A split in Vanua'aku Pati was
   resolved in August 2005, and Natapei was re-elected as its
   President,^[52][6]^[53][7] receiving 124 votes against 67 for [54]Sela
   Molisa.^[55][7] In late July 2007 he became Minister of Public
   Utilities again, replacing [56]Serge Vohor, as well as becoming Deputy
   Prime Minister.^[57][8]

[[58]edit] Second time as Prime Minister (2008present)

   Natapei was elected Prime Minister on 22 September 2008, by the
   [59]Parliament of Vanuatu after three weeks of negotiations following
   the country's [60]September 2nd general election.^[61][9] Natapei
   received 27 of the 52 votes in Parliament to become Prime Minister for
   a second term.^[62][9] He narrowly beat his nearest opponent,
   [63]Maxime Carlot Korman, another former Vanuatu Prime Minister and the
   leader of the [64]Vanuatu Republican Party, who captured 25 votes in
   Parliament.^[65][9] Natapei succeeded [66]Ham Lini as Prime Minister
   and headed a new [67]coalition government encompassing his own
   [68]Vanua'aku Pati, as well as Lini's [69]National United Party,
   independents and several smaller political parties, such as [70]Namangi
   Aute.^[71][10]

   Natapei pledged to continue the policies and reforms of the outgoing
   Lini government.^[72][9] He announced that some of his government's
   primary policies would include [73]transparency, [74]good governance
   and fighting [75]corruption.^[76][9]

   Opposition leader [77]Maxime Carlot Korman attempted a [78]vote of no
   confidence motion just two days after Natapei became Prime Minister.
   The [79]Opposition, led by Korman, claimed that two MPs had defected
   from Natapei coalition and were now supporting Korman. ^[80][11]
   However, the [81]Speaker of the Parliament [82]George Wells rejected
   Korman's motion against Natapei on a [83]technicality saying that one
   of the two MPs in question had not withdrawn their support for
   Natapei's government.^[84][11] A no-confidence vote was nevertheless
   held on October 3, 2008, but the motion was defeated, with 20 votes in
   favor and 31 votes against. Because Natapei's government won the vote
   by a substantial margin, it was expected that the political situation
   would be stabilized as a result.^[85][12] Nevertheless, another motion
   of no confidence was attempted on November 25, 2008; Natapei survived
   the vote by a narrow margin of 26 to 24.^[86][13] Three Vanua'aku Pati
   MPs signed the motion of no confidence, and after they refused to
   withdraw their signatures, Natapei suspended them from the party
   immediately prior to the vote.^[87][14]

[[88]edit] Cabinet line-up

   Natapei named his government's [89]cabinet line-up on September 22,
   2008, the day of his election as Prime Minister.^[90][15] His cabinet
   includes members of his own [91]Vanua'aku Pati (VP) as well as the
   [92]National United Party (VNUP).^[93][15] Natapei's predecessor,
   outgoing Prime Minister [94]Ham Lini, was named as the new Minister for
   [95]Public Utilities and Works.^[96][15]
