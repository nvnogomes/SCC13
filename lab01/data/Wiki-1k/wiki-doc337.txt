   [27]Allama Sir Muhammad Iqbal ([28]Urdu: ; November 9, 1877  April 21,
   1938) was a [29]Muslim poet, [30]philosopher and [31]politician born in
   [32]Sialkot, [33]British India (now in [34]Pakistan), whose poetry in
   [35]Urdu, [36]Arabic and [37]Persian is considered to be among the
   greatest of the modern era,^[38][1] and whose vision of an independent
   state for the Muslims of [39]British India was to inspire the creation
   of [40]Pakistan. He is commonly referred to as [41]Allama Iqbal ( ,
   Allama meaning "Scholar".)

   After studying in England and Germany, Iqbal established a law
   practice, but concentrated primarily on writing scholarly works on
   politics, economics, history, philosophy and religion. He is best known
   for his poetic works, including [42]Asrar-e-Khudiwhich brought a
   [43]knighthood [44]Rumuz-e-Bekhudi, and the [45]Bang-e-Dara, with its
   enduring patriotic song [46]Tarana-e-Hind. In India, he is regarding
   for the patriotic song, [47]Saare Jahan Se Achcha ( ). In
   [48]Afghanistan and [49]Iran, where he is known as Iqbl-e Lhor ( Iqbal
   of [50]Lahore), he is highly regarded for his Persian works.

   Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of
   [51]Islamic civilisation across the world, but specifically in India; a
   series of famous lectures he delivered to this effect were published as
   [52]The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. One of the most
   prominent leaders of the [53]All India Muslim League, Iqbal encouraged
   the creation of a "state in northwestern India for Indian Muslims" in
   his 1930 presidential address.^[54][2] Iqbal encouraged and worked
   closely with [55]Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and he is known as
   Muffakir-e-Pakistan ("The Thinker of Pakistan"), Shair-e-Mashriq ("The
   Poet of the East"), and Hakeem-ul-Ummat ("The Sage of [56]Ummah"). He
   is officially recognised as the "[57]national poet" in Pakistan. The
   anniversary of his birth ( - Ym-e Weldat-e Muammad Iqbl) on November 9
   is a [58]holiday in Pakistan.

Early life

          See also: [72]Timeline of Muhammad Iqbal's life

   Sheikh Muhammad Iqbal was born in [73]Sialkot, [74]Punjab, [75]British
   India (now part of [76]Pakistan); the eldest of five siblings in a
   [77]Kashmiri family. It is believed that Iqbal's family were originally
   [78]Hindu [79]Brahmins, but became [80]Muslim following his ancestor
   [81]Sahaj Ram Sapru's conversion to Islam, although this version is
   disputed by some scholars.^[82][3]^[83][4] Iqbal's father Shaikh Nur
   Muhammad was a prosperous tailor, well-known for his devotion to
   [84]Islam, and the family raised their children with deep religious
   grounding.
   Iqbal in 1899.

   Iqbal was educated initially by tutors in languages and writing,
   history, poetry and religion. His potential as a poet and writer was
   recognised by one of his tutors, Sayyid Mir Hassan, and Iqbal would
   continue to study under him at the [85]Scotch Mission College in
   Sialkot. The student became proficient in several languages and the
   skill of writing prose and poetry, and graduated in 1892. Following
   custom, at the age of 15 Iqbal's family arranged for him to be married
   to Karim Bibi, the daughter of an affluent [86]Gujrati physician. The
   couple had two children: a daughter, Mi'raj Begam (born 1895) and a
   son, Aftab (born 1899). Iqbal's third son died soon after birth. The
   husband and wife were unhappy in their marriage and eventually divorced
   in 1916.

   Iqbal entered the [87]Government College in [88]Lahore where he studied
   philosophy, [89]English literature and [90]Arabic and obtained a
   [91]Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating [92]cum laude. He won a gold
   medal for topping his examination in philosophy. While studying for his
   masters degree, Iqbal came under the wing of [93]Sir Thomas Arnold, a
   scholar of Islam and modern philosophy at the college. Arnold exposed
   the young man to Western culture and ideas, and served as a bridge for
   Iqbal between the ideas of East and West. Iqbal was appointed to a
   readership in Arabic at the [94]Oriental College in Lahore, and he
   published his first book in Urdu, The Knowledge of Economics in 1903.
   In 1905 Iqbal published the patriotic song, [95]Tarana-e-Hind (Song of
   India).

   At Sir Thomas's encouragement, Iqbal travelled to and spend many years
   studying in Europe. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from
   [96]Trinity College at [97]Cambridge in 1907, while simultaneously
   studying law at [98]Lincoln's Inn, from where he qualified as a
   [99]barrister in 1908. Iqbal also met a Muslim student, Atiyah Faizi in
   1907, and had a close relationship with her. In Europe, he started
   writing his poetry in Persian as well. Throughout his life, Iqbal would
   prefer writing in Persian as he believed it allowed him to fully
   express philosophical concepts, and it gave him a wider
   audience.^[100][1] It was while in England that he first participated
   in politics. Following the formation of the [101]All-India Muslim
   League in 1906, Iqbal was elected to the executive committee of its
   British chapter in 1908. Together with two other politicians, [102]Syed
   Hassan Bilgrami and [103]Syed Ameer Ali, Iqbal sat on the subcommittee
   which drafted the constitution of the League. In 1907, Iqbal travelled
   to Germany to pursue a [104]doctorate from the Faculty of Philosophy of
   the [105]Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitt at [106]Munich.^[[107]citation
   needed] Working under the supervision of Friedrich Hommel, Iqbal
   published a thesis titled: [108]The Development of Metaphysics in
   Persia.^[109][5]

Literary career

   Upon his return to India in 1908, Iqbal took up assistant professorship
   at the Government College in Lahore, but for financial reasons he
   relinquished it within a year to practise law. During this period,
   Iqbal's personal life was in turmoil. He divorced Karim Bibi in 1916,
   but provided financial support to her and their children for the rest
   of his life.

   While maintaining his legal practise, Iqbal began concentrating on
   spiritual and religious subjects, and publishing poetry and literary
   works. He became active in the [110]Anjuman-e-Himayat-e-Islam, a
   congress of Muslim intellectuals, writers and poets as well as
   politicians, and in 1919 became the general secretary of the
   organisation. Iqbal's thoughts in his work primarily focused on the
   spiritual direction and development of human society, centred around
   experiences from his travel and stay in Western Europe and the Middle
   East. He was profoundly influenced by Western philosophers such as
   [111]Friedrich Nietzsche, [112]Henri Bergson and [113]Goethe, and soon
   became a strong critic of Western society's separation of religion from
   state and what he perceived as its obsession with materialist pursuits.
   In London, 1908.

   The poetry and philosophy of [114]Mawlana Rumi bore the deepest
   influence on Iqbal's mind. Deeply grounded in religion since childhood,
   Iqbal would begin intensely concentrating on the study of Islam, the
   culture and history of Islamic civilization and its political future,
   and embrace [115]Rumi as "his guide." Iqbal would feature Rumi in the
   role of a guide in many of his poems, and his works focused on
   reminding his readers of the past glories of Islamic civilization, and
   delivering a message of a pure, spiritual focus on Islam as a source
   for socio-political liberation and greatness. Iqbal denounced political
   divisions within and amongst Muslim nations, and frequently alluded to
   and spoke in terms of the global Muslim community, or the
   Ummah.^[116][6]

Works in Persian

   Iqbal's poetic works are written mostly in [117]Persian rather than
   [118]Urdu. Among his 12,000 verses of poem, about 7,000 verses are in
   Persian. In 1915, he published his first collection of poetry, the
   [119]Asrar-e-Khudi (Secrets of the Self) in Persian. The poems delve
   into concepts of [120]ego and emphasise the spirit and self from a
   religious, spiritual perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's
   finest poetic work.^[121][7] In Asrar-e-Khudi, Iqbal has explained his
   philosophy of "Khudi," or "Self." He proves by various means that the
   whole universe obeys the will of the "Self." Iqbal condemns
   self-destruction. For him the aim of life is self-realization and
   self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the "Self" has to
   pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the
   knower of the "Self" to become the viceregent of [122]Allah.^[123][6]

   In his [124]Rumuz-e-Bekhudi (Hints of Selflessness), Iqbal seeks to
   prove that Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a
   nation's viability. A person must keep his individual characteristics
   intact but once this is achieved he should sacrifice his personal
   ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the "Self"
   out of society. Also in Persian and published in 1917, this group of
   poems has as its main themes the ideal [125]community, Islamic ethical
   and social principles and the relationship between the individual and
   society. Although he is true throughout to Islam, Iqbal recognises also
   the positive analogous aspects of other religions. The Rumuz-e-Bekhudi
   complements the emphasis on the self in the Asrar-e-Khudi and the two
   collections are often put in the same volume under the title
   Asrar-e-Rumuz (Hinting Secrets), and it is addressed to the world's
   Muslims. Iqbal sees the individual and his community as reflections of
   each other. The individual needs to be strengthened before he can be
   integrated into the community, whose development in turn depends on the
   preservation of the communal ego. It is through contact with others
   that an ego learns to accept the limitations of its own freedom and the
   meaning of love. Muslim communities must ensure order in life and must
   therefore preserve their communal tradition. It is in this context that
   Iqbal sees the vital role of women, who as mothers are directly
   responsible for inculcating values in their children.

   Iqbal's 1924 publication, the Payam-e-Mashriq (The Message of the
   [126]East) is closely connected to the West-stlicher Diwan by the
   famous German poet [127]Goethe. Goethe bemoaned that the West had
   become too materialistic in outlook and expected that the East would
   provide a message of hope that would resuscitate spiritual values.
   Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of
   morality, religion and civilization by underlining the need for
   cultivating feeling, ardour and dynamism. He explains that an
   individual could never aspire for higher dimensions unless he learns of
   the nature of spirituality.^[128][6] In his first visit to
   [129]Afghanistan, he presented his book "Payam-e Mashreq" to [130]King
   Amanullah Khan in which he admired the liberal movements of Afghanistan
   against the [131]British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to
   Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of
   [132]Kabul University.
   Iqbal in 1929, with his son [133]Javid Iqbal.

   The [134]Zabur-e-Ajam ([135]Persian Psalms), published in 1927,
   includes the poems Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed (Garden of New Secrets) and
   [136]Bandagi Nama (Book of Slavery). In Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed, Iqbal
   first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and
   modern insight and shows how it effects and concerns the world of
   action. Bandagi Nama denounces slavery by attempting to explain the
   spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here as in other
   books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present
   and preparing for the future, emphasising love, enthusiasm and energy
   to fill the ideal life.^[137][6] Iqbal's 1932 work, the [138]Javed Nama
   (Book of Javed) is named after and in a manner addressed to his son,
   who is featured in the poems, and follows the examples of the works of
   [139]Ibn Arabi and [140]Dante's [141]The Divine Comedy, through
   [142]mystical and exaggerated depiction across time. Iqbal depicts
   himself as [143]Zinda Rud ("A stream full of life") guided by Rumi,
   "the master," through various heavens and spheres, and has the honour
   of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine
   illuminations. In a passage re-living a historical period, Iqbal
   condemns the Muslim traitors who were instrumental in the defeat and
   death of Nawab [144]Siraj-ud-Daula of [145]Bengal and [146]Tipu Sultan
   of [147]Mysore respectively by betraying them for the benefit of the
   [148]British colonists, and thus delivering their country to the
   shackles of slavery. At the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks
   to the young people at large, and provides guidance to the "new
   generation."^[149][6]

   His love to Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He
   says in one of his poems:^[150][8]

   garche Urdu dar uzbat shakar ast

   lk Prs-am ze Hindi shrntar ast

   Translation:

   Even though in sweetness [151]Urdu* is sugar - (but) My [152]Persian is
   sweeter than [153]Hindi*
     * Note: In Iqbal's time the terms Hindi and Urdu were synonyms (see
       [154]Hindustani)

Works in Urdu

   Iqbal in Spain, 1933.

   Iqbal's first work published in Urdu, the [155]Bang-e-Dara (The Call of
   the Marching Bell) of 1924, was a collection of poetry written by him
   in three distinct phases of his life.^[156][6] The poems he wrote up to
   1905, the year Iqbal left for England imbibe patriotism and imagery of
   landscape, and includes the [157]Tarana-e-Hind (The Song of India),
   popularly known as [158]Saare Jahan Se Achcha and another poem
   [159]Tarana-e-Milli (Anthem of the (Muslim) Community), which was
   composed in the same metre and rhyme scheme as Saare Jahan Se Achcha.
   The second set of poems date from between 1905 and 1908 when Iqbal
   studied in Europe and dwell upon the nature of European society, which
   he emphasized had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired
   Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islamic
   culture and Muslim people, not from an Indian but a global perspective.
   Iqbal urges the global community of Muslims, addressed as the
   [160]Ummah to define personal, social and political existence by the
   values and teachings of Islam. Poems such as [161]Tulu'i Islam (Dawn of
   Islam) and Khizr-e-Rah (The Guided Path) are especially acclaimed.

   Iqbal preferred to work mainly in Persian for a predominant period of
   his career, but after 1930, his works were mainly in Urdu. The works of
   this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of
   India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam, and Muslim spiritual
   and political reawakening. Published in 1935, the [162]Bal-e-Jibril
   (Wings of [163]Gabriel) is considered by many critics as the finest of
   Iqbal's Urdu poetry, and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he
   visited the monuments and legacy of the kingdom of the [164]Moors. It
   consists of [165]ghazals, poems, [166]quatrains, [167]epigrams and
   carries a strong sense religious passion.^[168][6]

   The [169]Pas Cheh Bayed Kard ai Aqwam-e-Sharq (What are we to do, O
   Nations of the East?) includes the poem Musafir (Traveller). Again,
   Iqbal depicts Rumi as a character and an exposition of the mysteries of
   Islamic laws and [170]Sufi perceptions is given. Iqbal laments the
   dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim
   nations. Musafir is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to
   Afghanistan, in which the [171]Pashtun people are counseled to learn
   the "secret of Islam" and to "build up the self" within
   themselves.^[172][6] Iqbal's final work was the [173]Armughan-e-Hijaz
   (The Gift of [174]Hijaz), published posthumously in 1938. The first
   part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some
   poems and [175]epigrams in Urdu. The Persian [176]quatrains convey the
   impression as though the poet is travelling through the [177]Hijaz in
   his imagination. Profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the
   salient features of these short poems. The Urdu portion of the book
   contains some categorical criticism of the intellectual movements and
   social and political revolutions of the modern age.

Political career

   Iqbal with Muslim political activists.

   While dividing his time between law and poetry, Iqbal had remained
   active in the Muslim League. He supported Indian involvement in
   [178]World War I, as well as the [179]Khilafat movement and remained in
   close touch with Muslim political leaders such as [180]Maulana Mohammad
   Ali and [181]Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a critic of the mainstream
   [182]Indian National Congress, which he regarded as dominated by
   [183]Hindus and was disappointed with the League when during the 1920s,
   it was absorbed in factional divides between the pro-British group led
   by [184]Sir Muhammad Shafi and the centrist group led by Jinnah.

   In November 1926, with the encouragement of friends and supporters,
   Iqbal contested for a seat in the [185]Punjab Legislative Assembly from
   the Muslim district of Lahore, and defeated his opponent by a margin of
   3,177 votes.^[186][9] He supported the [187]constitutional proposals
   presented by Jinnah with the aim of guaranteeing Muslim political
   rights and influence in a coalition with the Congress, and worked with
   the [188]Aga Khan and other Muslim leaders to mend the factional
   divisions and achieve unity in the Muslim League.

Revival of Islamic polity

   Iqbal's second book in English, the [189]Reconstruction of Religious
   Thought in Islam, is a collection of his six lectures which he
   delivered at [190]Madras, [191]Hyderabad and [192]Aligarh; first
   published as a collection in [193]Lahore, in 1930. These lectures dwell
   on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal
   philosophy in the modern age. In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects
   the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw
   as morally-misguided, attached to power and without any standing with
   Muslim masses. Iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism
   weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that
   India's [194]Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage,
   culture and political influence. In his travels to [195]Egypt,
   [196]Afghanistan, [197]Iran and [198]Turkey, he promoted ideas of
   greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the
   shedding of nationalist differences. He also speculated on different
   political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a
   dialogue with Dr. [199]B. R. Ambedkar, Iqbal expressed his desire to
   see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of
   the British government and with no central Indian government. He
   envisaged autonomous Muslim provinces in India. Under one Indian union
   he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects especially
   with regard to their existentially separate entity as Muslims.^[200][9]
   Sir Muhammad Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930
   at its session in [201]Allahabad, in the [202]United Provinces as well
   as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his presidential address on
   December 29, 1930, Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for
   Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India:
   Iqbal with [203]Choudhary Rahmat Ali and other Muslim activists.

     "I would like to see the [204]Punjab, [205]North-West Frontier
     Province, [206]Sind and [207]Baluchistan amalgamated into a single
     state. Self-government within the [208]British Empire, or without
     the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated Northwest Indian
     Muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims,
     at least of Northwest India."^[209][2]

   In his speech, Iqbal emphasised that unlike [210]Christianity, Islam
   came with "legal concepts" with "civic significance," with its
   "religious ideals" considered as inseparable from social order:
   "therefore, the construction of a policy on national lines, if it means
   a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, is simply
   unthinkable to a Muslim."^[211][10] Iqbal thus stressed not only the
   need for the political unity of Muslim communities, but the
   undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society
   not based on Islamic principles. He thus became the first politician to
   articulate what would become known as the [212]Two-Nation Theory that
   Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence
   from other regions and communities of India. However, he would not
   elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would construe a
   [213]theocracy, even as he rejected secularism and nationalism. The
   latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He
   would travel across Europe and West Asia to garner political and
   financial support for the League, and he reiterated his ideas in his
   1932 address, and during the [214]Third Round-Table Conference, he
   opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without
   considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces. He would
   serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver
   speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across
   India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised
   feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians averse to the
   League.

Relationship with Jinnah

   Final years.

          See also: [215]Muhammad Ali Jinnah

   Ideologically separated from Congress Muslim leaders, Iqbal had also
   been disillusioned with the politicians of the Muslim League owing to
   the factional conflict that plagued the League in the 1920s. Discontent
   with factional leaders like Sir Muhammad Shafi and Sir Fazl-ur-Rahman,
   Iqbal came to believe that only Muhammad Ali Jinnah was a political
   leader capable of preserving this unity and fulfilling the League's
   objectives on Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal
   correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was an influential force on
   convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in [216]London, return
   to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that
   Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the
   League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress:

     "I know you are a busy man but I do hope you won't mind my writing
     to you often, as you are the only Muslim in India today to whom the
     community has right to look up for safe guidance through the storm
     which is coming to North-West India and, perhaps, to the whole of
     India."^[217][11]

   There were significant differences between the two men while Iqbal
   believed that [218]Islam was the source of government and society,
   Jinnah was a believer in secular government and had laid out a secular
   vision for Pakistan where religion would have "nothing to do with the
   business of the state."^[219][12] Iqbal had backed the Khilafat
   struggle; Jinnah had dismissed it as "religious frenzy." And while
   Iqbal espoused the idea of partitioning Muslim-majority provinces in
   1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the
   decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940. Some
   historians postulate that Jinnah always remained hopeful for an
   agreement with the Congress and never fully desired the partition of
   India.^[220][13] Iqbal's close correspondence with Jinnah is speculated
   by some historians as having been responsible for Jinnah's embrace of
   the idea of Pakistan.^[221][14] Iqbal elucidated to Jinnah his vision
   of a separate Muslim state in a letter sent on June 21, 1937:

     "A separate federation of Muslim Provinces, reformed on the lines I
     have suggested above, is the only course by which we can secure a
     peaceful India and save Muslims from the domination of Non-Muslims.
     Why should not the Muslims of North-West India and [222]Bengal be
     considered as nations entitled to self-determination just as other
     nations in India and outside India are."^[223][9]

   Iqbal, serving as president of the Punjab Muslim League, criticised
   Jinnah's political actions, including a political agreement with
   Punjabi leader [224]Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan, whom Iqbal saw as a
   representative of feudal classes and not committed to Islam as the core
   political philosophy. Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to
   encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League.
   Speaking about the political future of Muslims in India, Iqbal said:

     "There is only one way out. Muslims should strengthen Jinnah's
     hands. They should join the Muslim League. Indian question, as is
     now being solved, can be countered by our united front against both
     the Hindus and the English. Without it, our demands are not going to
     be accepted. People say our demands smack of communalism. This is
     sheer propaganda. These demands relate to the defence of our
     national existence.... The united front can be formed under the
     leadership of the Muslim League. And the Muslim League can succeed
     only on account of Jinnah. Now none but Jinnah is capable of leading
     the Muslims."^[225][11]

   In his views on Muslim political future, Iqbal was at odds with
   [226]Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, who had opposed the partition of India.
   Maududi had however, been closer to Iqbal's poetic-philosophy of an
   ideal Islamic state which would reject secularism and nationalism.
   After the creation of Pakistan, nine years after Iqbal's death, Jinnah
   and other League politicians would publicly credit Iqbal as one of the
   visionaries and founders of the state.

Death

   [227]Iqbal's mausoleum, next to [228]Badshahi Masjid, [229]Lahore,
   [230]Pakistan.

   In 1933, after returning from a trip to Spain and Afghanistan, Iqbal's
   health deteriorated^[[231]specify]. He spent his final years working to
   establish the Idara Dar-ul-Islam, an institution where studies in
   classical Islam and contemporary social science would be subsidised,
   and advocating the demand for an independent Muslim state. Iqbal ceased
   practising law in 1934 and he was granted pension by the [232]Nawab of
   Bhopal. After suffering for months from a series of protracted
   illnesses^[[233]specify], Iqbal died in Lahore in 1938. [234]His tomb
   is located in the space between the entrance of the [235]Badshahi
   Mosque and the [236]Lahore Fort, and an official guard is maintained
   there by the [237]Government of Pakistan.

   Iqbal is commemorated widely in Pakistan, where he is regarded as the
   ideological founder of the state. His [238]Tarana-e-Hind is a song that
   is widely used in India as a patriotic song speaking of communal
   harmony. His birthday is annually commemorated in Pakistan as Iqbal Day
   and is a national holiday. For a long time, Iqbal's actual date of
   birth remained disputed, with many believing February 23 to be the date
   of Iqbal's birth.^[[239]citation needed] On February 1, 1974 a
   Pakistani government committee officially declared Iqbal's date of
   birth to be November 9.^[[240]citation needed] Iqbal is the
   [241]namesake of many public institutions, including the [242]Allama
   Iqbal Medical College,Lahore, [243]Allama Iqbal Open University and the
   [244]Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore the second-busiest
   airport in the nation. Government and public organizations have
   sponsored the establishment of colleges and schools dedicated to Iqbal,
   and have established the [245]Iqbal Academy to research, teach and
   preserve the works, literature and philosophy of Iqbal. His son
   [246]Javid Iqbal has served as a justice on the [247]Supreme Court of
   Pakistan.

Influence and Legacy

   Allama Iqbal is regarded as one of the most influential Muslim poet and
   scholar of the 20th century throughout the Muslim World. His concept of
   Islamic revival did not only lead to the creation of Pakistan, but also
   the Iranian Revolution which he had prophesied. His works were also
   influential during the breaking up of the central Asian former Soviet
   republics, most of which were Muslim majority. Allama Iqbal's poetry
   has also been translated into several European languages where his
   works were amous during the early part of the 20th Century.

   He lives on through the various organizations dedicated to his works
   throughout the world. He lives among Iran as one of the greatest
   Persian Poets ever, in Pakistan as the greatest Urdu poet of all time
   and is regarded as the national poet and hero, who was the bases of the
   creation of the first Muslim Nation. His works have been famously made
   into songs by various artists from time to time, the most famous being
   the sufi-rock band '[248]Junoon'. In India he lives on through his
   national song 'Sarey Jahan sey acha'.

   The International airport at [249]Lahore, the city where he died and is
   buried, is named after him. He is also featured on Pakistani currency.

Criticism

   Interior of Iqbal's tomb.

   Some intellectuals criticised Iqbal for embracing [250]Nietzsche's
   concept of [251]bermensch, reflected in Iqbal's descriptions of ego,
   self, and renewal for Muslim civilization. In her book on Iqbal, the
   German scholar [252]Annemarie Schimmel defends him from this charge,
   saying that Iqbal's approval of [253]Sharia as the appropriate set of
   limits for the self or ego "marks the distinction between Iqbal's
   [254]Perfect Man and the Nietzschean superman." ^[255][15]

   Iqbal has also been criticised for his advocacy of Islamic political
   revival and rejection of Western cultural influences. Several scholars
   have called his poetic descriptions of the true practice of Islam
   impractical and wrongly dismissive of diverse societies and cultural
   heritages.^[256][10] Nonetheless, it is his advocacy of Islamic
   political revival and his concept of "khudi" or self-esteem that earns
   him much of his respect in the Muslim world.

   While credited and admired as the conceptual founder of Pakistan, Iqbal
   is criticised by some historians and scholars for implicitly endorsing
   the incompatibility of Muslims with other religious communities. Some
   historians and Indian nationalists criticise Iqbal's vision for a
   Muslim state as specifically implying the denunciation of [257]Hindus
   and [258]Hinduism, as well as the peaceful co-existence of Hindus and
   Muslims.^[259][10] Iqbal was also strongly criticised for advocating on
   occasions, the division and fragmentation of India. Critics also point
   to the [260]civil war that led to the secession of [261]East Pakistan
   in 1971, as well as recent sectarian and religious conflict in Pakistan
   to suggest that Iqbal's notion of a natural Muslim nation and of Islam
   as a political, unifying identity was inherently flawed and
   fanciful.^[262][10] Despite this criticism, Iqbal is widely credited
   for his work in encouraging the political rejuvenation and empowerment
   of Muslims, and as a great poet not only in India and Pakistan, but
   also in Iran, Afghanistan and Muslim nations in the [263]Middle East.

   Contemporary Persian and Classical Persian are the same language, but
   writers since 1900 are classified as contemporary. The above lists
   include poets mostly of Iranic background but also some of Indic,
   Turkic and Slavic backgrounds. At one time, Persian was a common
   cultural language of much of the non-Arabic Islamic world.
