Dots and Boxes

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Dots and boxes)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   Dots and Boxes (also known as Boxes, Squares, Paddocks, Square-it, Dots
   and Dashes, Dots, Smart Dots, or, simply, the Dot Game) is a [9]pencil
   and paper game for two players (or sometimes, more than two).
   Game of dots and boxes on the 22 board.

   Starting with an empty grid of dots, players take turns, adding a
   single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots.
   A player who completes the fourth side of a box earns one point and
   takes another turn. (The points are typically recorded by placing in
   the box an identifying mark of the player, such as an initial). The
   game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner of the game is
   the player with the most points.

   The board may be of any size. When short on time, 22 boxes (created by
   a square of 9 dots) is good for beginners, and 66 is good for experts.
   In games with an even number of boxes, it is conventional that if the
   game is tied then the win should be awarded to the second player (this
   offsets the advantage of going first).

   The diagram on the right shows a game being played on the 22 board. The
   second player (B) plays the mirror image of the first player's move,
   hoping to divide the board into two pieces and tie the game. The first
   player (A) makes a sacrifice at move 7; B accepts the sacrifice,
   getting one box. However, B must now add another line, and connects the
   center dot to the center-right dot, causing the remaining boxes to be
   joined together in a chain as shown at the end of move 8. With A's next
   move, A gets them all, winning 31.

[[14]edit] Strategy

   The double-cross strategy. Faced with position 1, a novice player would
   create position 2 and lose. An experienced player would create position
   3 and win.

   Beginners play more or less at random until all the remaining boxes are
   joined together into chains, whereupon any move gives away all the
   boxes in a chain to the opponent. A novice player faced with a
   situation like position 1 in the diagram on the left, in which some
   boxes can be captured, takes all the boxes in the chain, resulting in
   position 2. But with the extra move, they have to open the next (and
   larger) chain, and the novice loses the game, 45.

   An experienced player faced with position 1 instead plays the
   double-cross strategy, taking all but 2 of the boxes in the chain,
   leaving position 3. This leaves the last two boxes in the chain for
   their opponent, but then the opponent has to open the next chain. By
   moving to position 3 player A wins 72.

   A common alternate ruleset is to require all available boxes be claimed
   on your turn. This eliminates the double cross strategy, forcing even
   the experienced player to take all the boxes, and give his opponent the
   win.

   The double-cross strategy applies however many long chains there are.
   Take all but two of the boxes in each chain, but take all the boxes in
   the last chain. If the chains are long enough then the player will
   certainly win. Therefore, when played by experts, Dots and Boxes
   becomes a battle for control: An expert player tries to force their
   opponent to be the one who starts the first long chain. Against a
   player who doesn't understand the concept of a sacrifice, the expert
   simply has to make the correct number of them to set up the opponent to
   hand him the first sufficiently chain. If the other player also knows
   to offer sacrifices, the expert also have to manipulate the number of
   available sacrifices through earlier play.

   There is never any reason not to accept a sacrifice, as if it is
   refused, the player who offered it can always take it without penalty.
   Thus, the impact of refusing a sacrifice need not be considered in your
   strategy.

   In [15]combinatorial game theory dots and boxes is very close to being
   an [16]impartial game and many positions can be analyzed using
   [17]SpragueGrundy theory.

[[18]edit] Unusual grids

   Dots and boxes need not be played on a rectangular grid. It can be
   played on a triangular grid or a hexagonal grid.

   Dots-and-boxes has a [19]dual form called "strings-and-coins". This
   game is played on a network of coins (vertices) joined by strings
   (edges). Players take turns to cut a string. When a cut leaves a coin
   with no strings, the player pockets the coin and takes another turn.
   The winner is the player who pockets the most coins. Strings-and-coins
   can be played on an arbitrary [20]graph. A variant played in Poland
   allows a player to claim a region of several squares as soon as its
   boundary is completed.
