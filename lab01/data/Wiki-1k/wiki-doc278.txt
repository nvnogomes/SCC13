   The Yellow-headed Amazon (Amazona oratrix), also known as the
   Yellow-headed Parrot, Double Yellow-headed Amazon, etc., is an
   [23]endangered [24]amazon parrot of [25]Mexico and northern [26]Central
   America. Measuring 3843 [27]cm (1517 [28]in) in length, it is a stocky
   short-tailed green parrot with a yellow head. It prefers to live in
   mangrove forests or forests near rivers or other bodies of water. It is
   often considered a [29]subspecies of the [30]Yellow-crowned Amazon. It
   is a popular [31]pet and an excellent talker.

[[39]edit] Taxonomy

   Close-up of head

   This species is part of the [40]Amazona ochrocephala complex, which
   also includes the [41]Yellow-naped Amazon (A. auropalliata). This
   complex, "a taxonomic headache",^[42][2] is considered a single species
   by some authorities and split into three species by others. The split
   is mainly based on the amount of yellow in the [43]plumage, the color
   of the legs and bill, the close proximity of A. oratrix and A.
   auropalliata in Oaxaca, Mexico, without apparent
   [44]interbreeding,^[45][3] and the presence of both A. ochrocephala and
   A. auropalliata in northern [46]Honduras.^[47][4] This evaluation has,
   however, been confused by misunderstandings regarding the plumage
   variations in the populations in northern Honduras, where birds vary
   greatly in amount of yellow on the head, crown and nape, but have pale
   bills and a [48]juvenile plumage matching A. oratrix, but neither A.
   ochrocephala nor A. auropalliata.^[49][2]^[50][5] In 1997, the
   population from the [51]Sula Valley in northern Honduras was described
   as a new subspecies, hondurensis, of A. oratrix.^[52][6] A.
   auropalliata caribaea on the [53]Islas de la Baha, which is in
   relatively close proximity to the recently described A. oratrix
   hondurensis, may have a relatively pale lower mandible, indicating that
   [54]gene flow may occur between the two.^[55][7] If confirmed, this
   could suggest that the two are better considered [56]conspecific.
   Alternatively, it has been suggested that caribaea and parvipes, both
   typically considered subspecies of A. auropalliata, may be closer to A.
   oratrix than they are to the [57]nominate A. auropalliata. Both are
   relatively small and have red on the shoulder like A. oratrix, but
   unlike nominate A. auropalliata.^[58][2]^[59][5] The members of this
   complex are known to hybridize in captivity,^[60][2] and recent
   [61]phylogenetic analysis of [62]DNA do not support the split.^[63][8]

   When split, A. oratrix traditionally includes the taxa tresmariae (from
   Tres Maras Islands), belizensis (from Belize) and hondurensis (from
   Sula Valley, Honduras) as [64]subspecies^[65][9] An additional
   subspecies, magma, has sometimes been recognized for the population on
   the [66]Gulf slope of Mexico, but today most authorities considered it
   invalid, instead including this population in oratrix, which also
   occurs on the [67]Pacific slope of Mexico.^[68][2]^[69][9]^[70][10] In
   contrast, the population in north-western Honduras and adjacent eastern
   Guatemala (near [71]Puerto Barrios), which resembles A. oratrix
   belizensis and commonly is included in that subspecies, may represent
   an undescribed subspecies. It has sometimes been referred to as
   guatemalensis,^[72][9] but until this population is [73]officially
   described, the name remains provisional.

   The origin of the common epithet "Double Yellow-headed" is that this
   species is differentiated from the others in the Yellow-headed Amazon
   complex by possessing both the yellow nape and yellow crown of its two
   close relatives, hence a "double-yellow" head.^[[74]citation needed]

[[75]edit] Description

   The Yellow-headed Amazon averages 3538 [76]cm (1415 [77]in)
   long.^[78][11] The shape is typical of amazons, with a robust build,
   rounded wings, and a square tail. The body is bright green, with yellow
   on the head, dark scallops on the neck, red at the bend of the wing,
   and yellow thighs. The flight [79]feathers are blackish to bluish
   violet with a red patch on the outer secondaries. The base of the tail
   also has a red patch, which is usually hidden. The outer tail feathers
   have yellowish tips.^[80][2]

   8 weeks old.

   The bill is horn-colored, darker in immatures of the Belizean and
   Honduran subspecies. The eye ring is whitish in Mexican birds and
   grayish in others. The most conspicuous geographical difference is the
   amount of yellow. In adults, the head and upper chest are yellow in the
   subspecies of the [82]Tres Maras Islands in the Mexican state of
   [83]Nayarit (tresmariae); just the head in the widespread subspecies of
   Mexico (oratrix); just the crown in Belize, Guatemala, and far
   northwestern Honduras (belizensis); and the crown and nape in the Sula
   Valley of Honduras (hondurensis, which thus resembles the Yellow-naped
   Parrot). Immatures have less yellow than adults; they attain adult
   plumage in 2 to 4 years.^[84][2]

   The [85]variety "Magna" (or "Magnum") is bred for more yellow and
   commands a premium price as a pet.^[86][12] Some "extreme" Magnas have
   as much yellow as Tres Maras birds, but are distinguished from them by
   heavier barring on the chest and a less bluish tint to the green
   plumage.^[87][13]

   Wild birds give low-pitched, sometimes human-sounding screams, but
   often fly silently (unlike many other parrots). Howell and Webb render
   some calls as "a rolled kyaa-aa-aaah and krra-aah-aa-ow, a deep, rolled
   ahrrrr or ahrhrrrr," etc. Young birds make a "clucking" sound to
   indicate that they are hungry.

[[88]edit] Distribution and habitat

   This species lives in [89]riparian forest and areas with scattered
   trees, as well as evergreen forest in [90]Belize and [91]mangroves in
   [92]Guatemala. It occurs in singly or in pairs, in small groups, and
   occasionally in big flocks. The range formerly included both coastal
   slopes of Mexico from the [93]Tres Maras Islands and [94]Jalisco to
   [95]Oaxaca and from [96]Nuevo Len to northern [97]Chiapas and
   southwestern [98]Tabasco, as well as a disjunct area including most of
   Belize, and another comprising a small part of northeastern Guatemala
   and northwestern [99]Honduras.^[100][2] However, their numbers have
   been reduced drasticallyby 90 percent, to 7,000, from the mid 1970s to
   1994,^[101][14] and by 68 percent from 1994 to 2004^[102][1]because of
   capture for the pet trade and habitat destruction.

[[103]edit] Conservation status

   The Yellow-headed Amazon is on the [104]CITES list Appendix I, which by
   international treaty, has made export, import and trade of wild-caught
   Yellow-headed Amazons illegal and the trade in birds bred in aviculture
   subject to controls in most of the world. Captive-bred Yellow-headed
   Amazons can be sold and owned legally subject to checks and
   regulations. Generally, throughout the world, sale of Appendix I
   species bred in aviculture must be accompanied with official
   certification which is provided by the breeder, and they must have a
   closed ring on one leg.

   The popularity of Yellow-headed Amazons as a pet continues to fuel
   [105]poaching efforts, which have nearly driven it to extinction in the
   wild. Their wild population has declined from 70,000 to 7,000 in the
   past two decades alone. An estimated 90% of poached Yellow-headed
   Amazons die before they are sold. Yellow-headed Parrots nest in holes
   in tree trunks or fallen branches. Poachers usually hack at the nest
   site with a [106]machete to steal parrots, which is especially
   destructive because habitat is lost at the same time that the wild
   parrot population is reduced.^[[107]citation needed]

[[108]edit] Qualities as pets

   Pet parrot

   Albeit it is only lawful to keep captive-bred Yellow-headed Amazons,
   these are widely available (if somewhat expensive) and their
   personalities make them highly desirable pets; they have been kept as
   such for centuries^[109][15] because they are among the parrots that
   "talk" best.^[110][16] Their vocal abilities are generally considered
   to be bested only by the [111]African Grey Parrot and matched by
   similar species such as the [112]Yellow-naped Parrot. They are also
   considered loud, active, intelligent, funny, and willful. They like to
   test their owners and to attract the attention of visitors.

   As in most amazons, nervous plucking of plumage is rare among this
   species. A generally recognized disadvantage of the Yellow-headed
   Amazon and its close relatives (such as the Yellow-naped Amazon) is
   hormonal aggressiveness, most notable among males in the breeding
   season. It is a member of the "Hot Three", along with the Yellow-Naped
   and Blue Front.[113][1][114][2]
