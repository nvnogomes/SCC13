Edmund Wallace Hildick

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Edmund Wallace Hildick (19252001) was a prolific and innovative^[8][1]
   children's author, who wrote under the name E W Hildick. He wrote,
   amongst others, the Ghost Squad, [9]Jim Starling, Birdy Jones, [10]Jack
   McGurk and Lemon Kelly series.

   He was born in Bradford, England in 1925. After two years service in
   the RAF he became a secondary school teacher, then a writer, before
   moving to the USA to become editor of a literary magazine. He was one
   of the very few British juvenile authors of his generation to achieve
   success in America.

   He started writing while he was a teacher in a Secondary Modern school
   at [11]Dewsbury in the West Riding of Yorkshire in England, his
   intended audience being "tough, modern kids similar to the ones I
   teach".^[12][2]

   Here, in one of his Birdy Jones novels, Hildick describes a boy
   organising a stage-coach ambush:

     They watched the resultant mle with a mixture of amusement and
     respect, for no-one could help admire Birdy's powers of imagination
     and stage management. A thin sharp-nosed boy, with cross-eyes and a
     black lens to his glasses, he didn't get on very well with boys of
     his own age and spent most of his time with youngsters, spellbinding
     them with his bright ideas for giving new life to old games.

   Although he had emigrated to the [13]U.S.A.^[14][3] in later life, he
   died in [15]London England.^[16][4]
