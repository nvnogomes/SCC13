[[70]edit] Synopsis

   The plot summary in this article is too long or detailed compared to
   the rest of the content. Please [71]edit the article to [72]focus on
   discussing the work rather than merely [73]reiterating the plot.
   (September 2008)

   During a storm that whips through the village of Devil's End in
   [74]Wiltshire, a dog gets away from its owner. He pursues it into a
   graveyard, only to encounter something unseen and die. The local doctor
   says that it was a [75]heart attack, but Olive Hawthorne, the local
   [76]witch, insists that the man died of fright. She has cast the runes,
   and there is evil afoot.

   Near the village, an archaeological dig is excavating the infamous
   Devil's Hump, a [77]Bronze Age [78]burial mound. The dig is being
   covered by [79]BBC Three. The interviewer, Alistair Fergus, speaks to
   the cantankerous Professor Horner, who claims that the Hump holds the
   treasure and tomb of a warrior chieftain, and that he plans to open the
   tomb at the stroke of midnight on [80]April 30, the [81]pagan festival
   of [82]Beltane.

   The television coverage is being watched by the [83]Third Doctor and
   [84]Jo at [85]UNIT. While the Doctor scoffs at Jo's notions of the
   coming of the [86]Age of Aquarius and the [87]supernatural, he feels
   that something is wrong with the dig. On the television, they see Olive
   go to the dig to protest, warning of great evil and the coming of the
   horned one, but she is dismissed as a crank. The Doctor tells Jo that
   Olive Hawthorne is right the dig must be stopped, and they start off to
   Devil's End.

   Olive returns to the village, and a strong wind whips up out of
   nowhere. She raises her hands to dismiss it, not knowing that the local
   [88]constable, PC Groom, has gone into a trance behind her and is about
   to strike her with a stone. The wind dies down as she chants, and PC
   Groom regains his senses before he lands the blow. Olive then goes to
   see the [89]vicar, but he has been mysteriously replaced with a new
   one, Mr Magister. Magister actually [90]the Master tries to assure her
   that her fears are unfounded, but his [91]hypnosis fails to overcome
   Olive's will, and she says she will find someone who will believe her.

   The Doctor and Jo, driving to Devil's End, get lost when a wind spins a
   signpost and points them in the wrong direction. Over at the Hump,
   tempers start to flare for no reason. When the Doctor and Jo stop by
   the village [92]pub to get directions, one of the villagers goes and
   informs the Master of the Doctor's presence. The Master tells him to
   get dressed for the ceremony.

   On the way to the Hump, the Doctor's car, Bessie, is blocked by a
   fallen tree. Unable to budge it, the Doctor and Jo rush to the mound on
   foot. The Master, dressed in ceremonial robes and with a coven of
   thirteen acolytes, starts a summoning ritual in the church catacombs.
   As his chanting grows more frenzied, the Doctor and Jo reach the mound
   and the Doctor rushes inside to stop Horner, but it is too late. The
   tomb door opens and icy gusts of wind rush out and the ground begins to
   shake, toppling the camera crew and even the coven in the catacombs.
   The Master laughs triumphantly and calls the entity's name [93]Azal,
   and the eyes of a [94]gargoyle, [95]Bok, flare with a reddish glow. Jo
   enters the mound to find Horner and the Doctor motionless, covered with
   frost.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Horner is dead, and the Doctor seems dead as well. The Master uses a
   knife to indicate a stone covered in ritual markings as the "appointed
   place", dismissing the coven. Back at UNIT, [96]Captain Mike Yates and
   [97]Sergeant Benton were watching the end of the broadcast as it went
   dead. They try to find out what's going on while attempting to contact
   the [98]Brigadier, who had earlier gone for a night at the opera.
   Meanwhile, the village doctor discovers that the Doctor may not be
   entirely dead after all, but is puzzled when he hears the beating of
   two hearts. Jo telephones Yates, who tells her he will be there by
   helicopter in the morning, just as the line is cut off from the
   outside. The Master prays in the church as Jo watches over the still
   unconscious Doctor in the pub. At the dig, the ground shakes and the
   constable on duty sees something gigantic with heavy footsteps, and
   falls.

   In the morning, Yates and Benton fly by [99]helicopter to Devil's End,
   and see burn marks on the fields before the village that resemble
   enormous footprints. Once in Devil's End, Benton decides to look around
   the village while Yates finally manages to contact the Brigadier, who
   is not pleased that Yates has commandeered his helicopter, and calls
   for a car. Benton, looking around in the church, finds Olive trapped in
   a cupboard, where the Master's [100]verger, Garvin, had locked her.
   Down in the cellar to hide from Garvin, she tells Benton about
   Magister. Garvin comes down with a [101]rifle, and Benton tries to
   disarm him. In the ensuing fight, Benton falls on the marked stone and
   seizes up. Garvin holds both of them at gunpoint and moves them
   outside, just as the ground starts to shake. Garvin fires up at
   something gigantic, but is engulfed in a fireball. The heat wave
   extends even into the village, knocking Jo and Yates down, just as the
   Doctor awakens with a start. Olive and Benton make their way back to
   the pub, and the Doctor discusses the incident with Olive, who says
   that she saw the [102]devil, 30 feet high and with horns. The Doctor is
   told of the new vicar, and realises who is behind this, as "Magister"
   is [103]Latin for "Master".

   The Brigadier finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is a
   barrier surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up
   and burst into flame. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation
   while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig, an act the Master seems to
   be able to sense. They find the constable dead and a small
   [104]spaceship in the mound the same shape as the Hump. Jo tries to
   lift it but cannot, as the Doctor explains that it weighs 750 tons.
   Suddenly, Bok leaps into the tent covering the entrance to the tomb,
   about to attack.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Doctor wards him off with some words in a strange language and an
   iron trowel. The Doctor explains to Jo that it was actually the words
   of a [105]Venusian lullaby it was the gargoyle's own superstition that
   drove it back.

   The Master, in the meantime, hypnotises the [106]squire, Winstanley, as
   Olive and the Doctor debate about whether it is magic or science that
   is at work here. The Brigadier discovers that the heat shield is dome
   shaped, centred on the church, with a radius of ten miles out and one
   mile high. The Doctor shows the others pictures of various [107]horned
   gods and [108]demons from Olive's occult and history book collection,
   and explains that the creature Olive saw was an [109]extraterrestrial,
   one of the Dmons from the planet Dmos, 60,000 [110]light years away,
   who came to [111]Earth one hundred thousand years before. The small
   spaceship's actual size is 200 feet long and 30 feet across, and the
   heat and cold waves they have been experiencing are the result of the
   energy displaced when the ship shrinks or grows. The Doctor further
   explains that the Dmons have influenced Earth throughout its history,
   becoming part of human [112]myth, and see the planet as a giant
   experiment. The Master has called the Dmon up once, and right now, it
   is so small as to be invisible. The third summoning, however, could
   signal the end of the experiment, and the world.

   The Brigadier contacts Yates and says he is about to try attacking the
   heat shield from the air. The Doctor warns him not to, saying that it
   would only strengthen it, and suggests they use a diathermic energy
   exchanger. When UNIT technician Osgood fails to understand what the
   Doctor is getting at, he says he will come out and explain. When he
   does so, Tom Girton, one the villagers working with Master, hijacks the
   UNIT helicopter and uses it to attack the Doctor. The Doctor manages to
   swerve Bessie out of the way and the helicopter explodes against the
   heat shield. As the Doctor relates his instructions to Osgood, who
   protests that it goes against the laws of physics, the Master summons
   Azal again. A heat wave and an [113]earth tremor once again sweeps
   through the village as Azal curses the Master for daring to summon him
   again.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Master tries to dismiss Azal with an iron candlestick holder, but
   it does not seem to work. The Master demands that Azal give him the
   power that is his right, but Azal warns him that he is not the Master's
   servant. Azal also senses the presence of another like the Master, and
   wants to speak to the Doctor to see if he is worthy to take over the
   world. Azal says on his third appearance, he will decide if Earth
   deserves to continue existing. If so, he will give it to the Master.
   Azal then vanishes in another heat wave.

   After explaining the process of creating the exchanger to Osgood, the
   Doctor returns to the village. However, the Master's agents are at
   work, and he is soon captured by a mob of villagers and tied up to a
   [114]maypole, about to be burned alive. Olive goes to the mob and tells
   them that the Doctor is a mighty [115]wizard, and with some help from
   Benton's [116]silenced [117]Pistol and a remote controlled Bessie,
   convinces the mob that the Doctor does indeed have magical powers. Jo
   and Mike, meanwhile, have returned to the church cellar and watch,
   hidden, as the Master gathers his coven to summon Azal one last time.
   Jo tries to interrupt the ritual, but it is too late.
     __________________________________________________________________

   With another rush of heat, Azal manifests himself and Jo and Yates are
   taken prisoner. Outside, the Doctor explains that to the now calmer
   villagers that his "magic" was due to science, and so is the Master's
   trickery. The rituals are merely used to focus the psychokinetic energy
   of humans that the Master needs to summon the Dmons. As Jo is prepared
   as a sacrifice to Azal, the exchanger finally works and UNIT forces go
   through the gap created in the heat shield, but the gap only lasts a
   few minutes and the exchanger soon overloads. Mike manages to escape
   and tell the Doctor about Jo, but Bok is guarding the entrance to the
   catacombs. The use of the exchanger momentarily weakens Bok and Azal,
   and the Doctor manages to rush by the gargoyle. He makes it down to the
   cellar, where the Master is expecting him.

   Outside, UNIT troops start firing at Bok, who can disintegrate objects
   and people with a wave of his hand, but he is also bulletproof. Even a
   [118]bazooka does not work, as the pieces of the gargoyle reform almost
   instantly. Inside the church, the Master makes his case to the Dmon,
   that he will rule the Earth experiment's people for their own good. The
   Doctor argues that Man should be given a chance to grow up. Azal
   finally decides to give his power to the Master, and fires
   [119]electricity at the Doctor to kill him. However, Jo, steps in front
   of the Doctor, asking Azal to kill her instead. This act of
   self-sacrifice does not make sense to Azal, and the confusion sends him
   into an agony. He shouts for all of them to leave as he is dying. Bok
   reverts to his stone form, and as everyone runs out of the church, it
   blows up. The Master tries to escape in Bessie, but the Doctor's remote
   control brings the car back, and the Master is taken into custody, to
   be put in maximum security.

   Olive Hawthorne hears the sound of bird songs and the smell of flowers
   once again, as the Earth is reborn each [120]May Day. Olive takes
   Benton to dance around the [121]maypole with the rest of the townsfolk,
   while Yates and the Brigadier go off to the pub for a drink. The Doctor
   and Jo join the dance, as the May Day celebrations continue and the
   Doctor remarks to Jo that perhaps there is magic in the world after
   all.

[[122]edit] Continuity

   The television news programme filmed at Devil's End was depicted as
   broadcast on a fictional channel called BBC Three, Since 2003, [123]BBC
   Three has been an actual digital BBC channel.

   The Doctor uses the words of a Venusian lullaby to ward off Bok. He
   uses the lullaby again in [124]The Curse of Peladon & 'The Monster of
   Peladon', singing the words to a tune which is actually the
   [125]Christmas carol "[126]God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen". [127]Venusian
   Lullaby is the title of a 1994 [128]Virgin Missing Adventures novel by
   [129]Paul Leonard featuring the [130]First Doctor.

   The new series suggests that the Doctor's theory that humans' ideas of
   demons were derived from the Dmons may be incorrect. The episode
   "[131]The Satan Pit" posits that all forms of theology about devils, on
   every planet (including Dmos), are derived from a primordial memory of
   a horned creature called the [132]Beast. [133]Russell T. Davies stated
   in the [134]Doctor Who Confidential episode "Religion and Myth" that
   they aimed to create a "Russian doll" effect, wrapping that episode
   around The Dmons.

   In the 2007 episode [135]Utopia, two sound clips from this story
   ("Destroy him!" & "Then you will give your power to me!") were used
   when professor Yana prepares to open his [136]fob watch.

   Fan myths associated with this story include the rumour that there was
   a sixth episode where the Master escaped from UNIT, recalled Azal, and
   killed everyone in Devil's End including the Doctor. This was actually
   an [137]April Fool's Day joke in the fan magazine [138]DWB.

[[139]edit] Atlantis

   Azal claims to have caused the destruction of [140]Atlantis. Fans often
   claim that this is one of three contradictory fates for Atlantis in the
   series, the other two being found in [141]The Underwater Menace and
   [142]The Time Monster.

   However, Atlantis is never actually seen to be destroyed in the latter
   two serials; in The Underwater Menace, only the lower levels of the
   city are seen to be flooded, and in The Time Monster, Kronos the
   chronovore is seen to wreck only the city's temple, the [143]Third
   Doctor and [144]Jo Grant's certainty otherwise in the following scenes
   notwithstanding.

   Furthermore, while the latter serial is expressly set in ancient
   Atlantis, in the eastern [145]Mediterranean Sea, the former one takes
   place in the [146]North Atlantic, and, given the presence of a souvenir
   from the 1968 [147]Mexico City [148]Olympics at the time of the
   original, early 1967, transmission more than a year and a half away in
   the future, at least from the perspective of the production team. (In
   Doctor Who: The Discontinuity Guide, [149]Paul Cornell, [150]Martin
   Day, and [151]Keith Topping speculate that this was an isolated
   Atlantean outpost that managed to survive to the late 20th Century).)

   Finally, in The Dmons itself, this is just one of a handful of
   non-specific claims Azal makes in a rant, and is not necessarily true.

   In the 2001 novel [152]The Quantum Archangel, by [153]Craig Hinton,
   Kronos claims it was the Daemons who gave the Atlanteans the ability to
   summon him. The canonicity of spin-off media is unclear.

     * Working titles for this story included The Demons.
     * Much of the serial was filmed on location in [158]Aldbourne,

     * Features an appearance by television presenter and [160]Sooty
       puppetteer, [161]Matthew Corbett. See also [162]Celebrity
       appearances in Doctor Who.
     * When the last episode of the story, which contains footage of a
       model church being blown up, was broadcast, many viewers mistakenly
       thought that the BBC had actually blown up a church as part of the
       filming. The BBC received a number of letters complaining about
       this.

[[163]edit] Outside references

     * The clip of the Brigadier's helicopter blowing up as it crashes
       into the heat shield is borrowed from the James Bond movie
       [164]From Russia With Love.^[[165]citation needed]
     * Many have noted the similarities between this story's plot and that
       of the 1958 BBC serial and [166]1967 [167]Hammer film
       [168]Quatermass and the Pit. Both involve the unearthing of an
       extraterrestrial spaceship, an alien race that has interfered with
       human evolution and is the basis for legends of devils, demons and
       witchcraft, and places with "devilish" names - Devil's End in this
       case, and [169]Hob's Lane in Pit.
     * The Master actually (and possibly deliberately) misquotes the
       occultist [170]Aleister Crowley at one point saying "To do my will
       shall be the whole of the law". Crowley is famous for the similar
       "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law."
     * The incantation that [171]the Master uses in summoning Azal is
       actually the nursery rhyme "[172]Mary Had a Little Lamb" said
       backwards.
     * The Doctor is briefly given the alias of "the Great Wizard Qui Quae
       Quod." This is actually the masculine, feminine, and neuter
       [173]nominative forms of the interrogative "who", in [174]Latin.

[[175]edit] Broadcast and reception

   The story was repeated on BBC One as an omnibus over Christmas 1971
   (28/12/71) at 4.20pm. The omnibus's opening credits gave the title as
   Doctor Who and the Dmons.

   Despite a request made at the time by [176]Barry Letts for the story to
   be retained on its original 625-line [177]PAL colour videotapes as an
   example of 1970s Doctor Who, all except Episode Four were wiped for
   reuse. However, a converted 525-line colour [178]NTSC version recorded
   off-air from an [179]American broadcast was made available to the BBC.
   This version was abridged and unsuitable for transmission as it was not
   of broadcast standard (the original US recordings were made on a
   domestic Betamax VCR). In 1992 the colour signal from the NTSC tapes
   was used as the basis for [180]colourising [181]16mm [182]monochrome
   [183]telerecordings of episodes one, two, three and five. The
   colourised version was subsequently repeated on [184]BBC2 on
   consecutive Fridays in November/December 1992 (20/11/92) to (18/12/92)
   at 7.15pm.

   The serial was again repeated on BBC4, as 2 compilation episodes, on
   October 21st and 22nd 2007.

   Jon Pertwee stated numerous times over the years that this was his
   favorite Doctor Who serial. In 1993, Pertwee, along with several
   members of the cast and crew including [185]Nicholas Courtney,
   [186]John Levene, [187]Richard Franklin and director [188]Christopher
   Barry returned to Aldbourne for the [189]Reeltime Pictures reunion
   documentary Return to Devil's End. Nicholas Courtney titled his
   [190]1998 volume of [191]autobiography Five Rounds Rapid after a line
   from this story:
   Jenkins. Chap with wings. Five rounds rapid.

   In 1993, the colourised version (see "Broadcast and reception", above)
   was released on [202]VHS. The final episode of this story was also
   issued as a b/w film recording on the VHS release The Pertwee Years,
   along with the final episodes of [203]Inferno and [204]Frontier in

   It has been reported that [205]Katy Manning has recorded commentary for

[[208]edit] In print

   A novelisation of this serial, written by [209]Barry Letts, was
   published by [210]Target Books in October 1974. There have been
   [211]Dutch and [212]Portuguese language editions. An unabridged reading
   of the novelisation by author Barry Letts was released on CD in August
   2008 by BBC Audiobooks.
