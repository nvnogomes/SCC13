   Drmte mig en drm i nat is the oldest [17]secular song in the [18]Nordic
   countries. It is written in [19]Old Danish and is included in [20]Codex
   Runicus, a transcript of [21]Scanian Law, as a final note written in
   [22]runes, like the law itself, and an old type of [23]musical notes.
   The text of the song is

          Drmde mik en drm i nat
          um silki ok rlik pl

   The meaning of the words silki and rlik pl is obscure. Common
   interpretations in the literature are variants of "last night I had a
   dream about silk and a good fur coat" and "last night I had a dream
   about silk and expensive cloth". However, since the song appears to be
   written down by the same hand that must have spent days of scribbling
   the runes of the law on the [24]parchment, it would be more natural if
   the lyrics of the song had something to do with the content of the
   document.^[[25]citation needed] One would expect something about law
   and order, rather than a luxury life.^[[26]citation needed]
   Interpretations that fit better with this expectation is "tonight I had
   a dream about justice and fair play" or "today I had a dream about
   equality and honest measure".^[[27]citation needed]

   The word silki might be related to the old word slik - the same as. The
   word is still used in [28]Norwegian, with a similar meaning. rlik pl
   could be "honest measure", since pla, and the related forms pl and pel,
   are old words for "measure". It comes from pegel in [29]latin. rlik is
   used meaning "honest" ("rlig" in modern Danish) on the very first page
   of the Codex Runicus.

[[30]edit] Musical notes

          [31]Image:dromde mik en drom.jpg

   There are different interpretations also on the musical notes of the
   song. [32]Tobias Norlind believed it was an early version of
   [33]Staffansvisan, a song found in many versions about [34]Saint
   Stephen and used in yearly rites. Norlind however did not attempt to
   interpret the rhythmical structure of the song. Another version was for
   several years the tune used to fill out breaks between radio programmes
   in [35]Danmarks Radio. Here, the first half of the tune has been
   interpreted as [36]iambs.

   Considering how traditional tuned, carried in oral tradition since the
   [38]middle ages usually are structured, it is also quite possible to
   interpret the song as a typical dance tune consisting of four plus four
   [39]bars.
