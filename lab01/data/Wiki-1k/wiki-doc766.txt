[[53]edit] History

   University Park on campus, in the background is the Rec/IM center. On
   the far right (not in view) is the Student Center.

   It was founded in 1849 as Michigan State Normal School, the first in
   Michigan and the first [54]normal school created outside the original
   13 colonies. Michigan created a state educational system modeled on
   that of Germany. The normal schools were to train teachers for common
   schools, which were being established rapidly in new towns in the
   state. In 1899, it became the Michigan State Normal College when it
   created the first four-year curriculum for a normal college in the
   nation. With the additions of departments, it became Eastern Michigan
   College in 1956, and finally Eastern Michigan University in 1959.
   Education, Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School were the first
   three colleges in the newly created university. Several major
   expansions followed shortly afterward, including the addition of the
   College of Business in 1964, the College of Health and Human Services
   in 1975 and the College of Technology in 1980. More recently, extended
   programs were added such as Continuing Education, the Centers for
   Corporate Training, the World College and numerous community-focused
   institutes.

   Physically, the campus has grown with the construction of the
   Terrestrial and Aquatic Research Facility (1998), the [55]Convocation
   Center (1998), the Bruce T. Halle Library (1998), the John W. Porter
   College of Education Building (1999), the Everett L. Marshall College
   of Health and Human Services Building (2000), the Village residence
   hall (2001) and University House (2003). A new Student Center opened in
   2006.

   Total student population averages about 23,000, of whom roughly 5,000
   are graduate students. Most programs are undergraduate or master's
   level, although the university has doctoral programs in Educational
   Leadership, Technology, and Psychology. Susan W. Martin, Ph.D., took
   office as EMU's twenty-second president on July 7, 2008. Her
   predecessor, John Fallon III, Ph.D., was fired on July 15, 2007
   following a unanimous vote by the Board of Regents in the wake of
   widespread criticism of his handling of issues around the murder of
   student Laura Dickinson.

[[57]edit] Campus

   The Towers, an example of on-campus residence halls for upperclassmen.

   EMU is located in Ypsilanti, a city 35 miles (56 km) west of
   [58]Detroit and eight miles (13 km) east of [59]Ann Arbor. [60]Detroit
   Metro Airport is a fifteen minute drive from campus. The school is a
   culturally diverse learning and teaching community set in a small city
   environment, amid a major metropolitan area. Students, attracted by the
   school's atmosphere and location, come not only from the Metro Detroit
   area, but from the entirety of the state of Michigan; EMU is well known
   nationally and internationally as well. The university's site is
   composed of an academic and athletic campus spread across 800 acres
   (3.2 km^2), with 122 buildings.

   Like all colleges and universities in the United States, under the
   Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act (1990), EMU reports its
   on-campus crime statistics to the [61]Michigan State Police and
   publishes the numbers on the [62]Campus Safety website. Ypsilanti crime
   rates can be compared to other cities using [63]Detroit Michigan Crime
   Statistics and Data Resources website.

   The EMU campus includes several buildings with sculpture by [64]Corrado
   Parducci.

[[87]edit] Student life

   While Eastern Michigan University is mainly a commuter campus, the
   school provides countless co-curricular opportunities. Students work
   with volunteer organizations such as Habitat for Humanity both during
   the school year and on breaks. The Greek system provides several
   fraternities and sororities that students can join, many of which have
   houses within walking distance of campus. Other clubs include the
   Muslim Student Organization, Phi Theta Kappa, and the LGBTA (Lesbian,
   Gay, Bisexual, Transgender/Transsexual Association). EMU's
   co-curricular staff also works to provide fun trips for the students;
   in the past, they have included a weekend train trip to Chicago and a
   bus trip to Detroit's Second City Comedy Club.

   Student life blends easily with off-campus activities as well. EMU's
   campus is within walking distance of Depot Town, Ypsilanti's historical
   shop area where students go for ice cream, games of pool, and live
   music. Washtenaw Avenue, the main street that runs along the south end
   of the campus, holds several coffee shops and restaurants where
   students study, eat, and listen to (or take part in) live performances.
   The Tower Inn, for instance, is less than a five-minute walk from
   Pray-Harrold, and is owned by a married couple who are both Eastern
   Michigan alums.

[[88]edit] Journalism

   The [89]Eastern Echo, EMU's independent student newspaper, is published
   three times a week during the fall and winter semesters and once a week
   during the spring semester. The paper won eight awards in the 2005
   Division 1 Michigan Collegiate Press Association contest, including
   second place in the general excellence category. The newspaper, which
   is funded through advertising revenue, is not under the editorial
   control of the university. It also publishes content online at
   [90]http://www.easternecho.com.

   Also part of the EMU Student Media Office is Cellar Roots, the school's
   student-run literary and fine arts magazine. Cellar Roots celebrated
   its 35th anniversary in 2006 with a week of events that highlighted the
   history of the publication. Cellar Roots is a five time winner of the
   National Pacemaker award for design, an award often equated with the
   Pulitzer Prize for the college level, as well numerous other awards.
   [91]Cellar Roots

   Recently (Dec. 2007), a group of former students also started a
   magazine called emYOU! The Magazine ([92][7]). It caters to Eastern
   students as well as the Ypsilanti community. The magazine is a monthly
   publication.

[[93]edit] Music

   The school song "Our Pledge" was written by Edward Bowles and was
   arranged for the [94]marching band by [95]Thomas Tyra. The melody of
   "Eagles Fight Song" was written by Larry Livingston and arranged for
   marching band by Thomas Tyra. The percussion parts were written by
   [96]Whitney Prince. "Go Green" was written by Thomas Tyra.

[[97]edit] Marching and basketball bands

   The Eastern Michigan University Marching Band, nicknamed "The Pride of
   the Peninsula", was first formed in 1924. Notable past leaders of the
   EMU band program include Mitch Osadchuk (1956 - 1964), Thomas Tyra
   (1964 - 1977), Max Plank (1979 - 2002) and Scott Boerma (2002 - 2007).
   The University Bands are presently directed by Dr. Mary K. Schneider
   (the Wind Symphony) and Professor John Zastoupil (the Symphonic Band
   and Marching Band). The band plays both Go Green and the Eagles Fight
   Song for pregame at football games, and after every game and rehearsal
   the marching band sings Our Pledge. Other major parts of the pregame
   performance include the tunnel entrance and "The Floating E".

   The EMU Marching Band also provides a wide variety of half time
   entertainment throughout the season. In recent years, The EMUMB has
   traveled with the football team to The University of Michigan, Michigan
   State University, and Ford Field in Detroit. The EMU Marching Band has
   also performed at venues such as The Pontiac Silverdome and Rich
   Stadium in Buffalo, NY. In 2008, The EMUMB performed in America's
   Thanksgiving Day Parade in Detroit, MI.

   The Eastern Michigan University Basketball Band is directed by the two
   graduate assistants of the band. Unlike the marching band which is made
   up of all brass and woodwinds, the Basketball Band's instrumentation is
   strictly "Brass and Sax". The Basketball Band travels with the
   basketball teams during the MAC tournament or the NCAA tournament.

[[98]edit] "Our Pledge" lyrics

   Eastern, sacred alma mater,
   To your name we shall be true.
   Ever marching on to victory,
   We'll stand by to see you through.
   Softly floating on the breeze
   Verdant green with white of snow.
   This our banner we will carry
   In our hearts, where e'er we go.

[[99]edit] Eastern Eagles Fight Song lyrics

   The main Eastern Michigan University [100]fight song is the "Eagles
   Fight Song":

   Eastern Eagles hats off to you
   Fight, fight, fight for old E-M-U
   Look to the sky,
   The Eagles will fly,
   The bravest we'll defy
   Rah! Rah! Rah
   Hold that line for old green and white
   Sons and daughters show your might
   So FIGHT! (fight!) FIGHT! (fight!) for old E-M-U and vic-tor-ry

[[101]edit] Go Green lyrics

   "Go Green" is the Eastern Michigan University Spirit Song.

   Go Green, roll up the score
   Go Green, let's get some more
   Raise a cheer for old green and white
   Let's show them we came here to fight
   Go Green, vic'try we'll claim
   Go Green, let's win this game
   We'll always fight for old E-M-U
   Come on and let's go Green!

[[102]edit] Kappa Phi Alpha

   One of Eastern Michigan Universities oldest Greek Letter Fraternities,
   Kappa Phi Alpha was founded by Dimon H. Roberts in 1902 on EMU's
   Campus. The Kappa Phi Alpha chapter is the only chapter of this
   organization in the world. Occupying the same house since the early
   50's - 122 N. Normal St. the Kappas have for over 100 years been an
   active and contributing member of the greek system. The Kappa Phi Alpha
   colors are Royal Morgan and Gold, and the official flower is the
   American Beauty Rose.

[[103]edit] Alpha Sigma Tau

   [104]Alpha Sigma Tau, a national [105]sorority, was founded at Eastern
   Michigan University on November 4, 1899. Alpha Sigma Tau is a member of
   the [106]National Panhellenic Conference. After more than a century,
   AST remains active at EMU as the Alpha Chapter.

   Alpha Sigma Tau's colors are [107]emerald green and [108]gold. Its
   national symbol is the [109]anchor, its jewel is the [110]pearl, and
   its flower is the [111]yellow rose.

[[112]edit] Library

   Halle Library from McKenny side of campus.

   The Bruce T. Halle Library is a state-of-the-art four-story facility.
   It is the sole library on campus and is within a ten-minute walk of all
   of the school's residence halls. It includes computer labs, study
   spaces, the Holman Learning Center (which provides free tutoring), a
   distance-learning classroom, the Faculty Development Center, the ICT
   Help Desk, a multi-media area, a theater, an auditorium, the University
   archives, the carillon tower and the Paradox Cafe. It houses one of the
   largest collections of [113]children's literature in the [114]United
   States. The building has full wireless connectivity, as well as an
   automated retrieval system (the ARC) capable of housing 1 million
   items. While the most-used books are still on shelves, the majority of
   the school's books are stored within this system, which runs several
   stories underneath the library itself.

   Bruce Halle was the head of the [115]Discount Tire Company, and has
   been a major benefactor.

[[116]edit] Forensics

   EMU is home to one of the nation's most successful [117]Forensics
   (competitive speech) teams. The EMU Forensics team, currently ranked
   9th in the nation, has the distinction of being the only program in the
   country to place in the top 10 at every [118]NFA national championship
   since they began in 1971^[119][2]. The EMU forensics team has won 10
   team national championships and 66 individual national championships.
   With 33 out of a possible 35 state championships, the team is the
   foremost forensics competitive team in the state of [120]Michigan. This
   reputation has been enhanced by the fact that EMU competitors have won
   over 200 individual state champions.

[[121]edit] Student safety on campus

   This March 9, 1989 fire in Sherzer destroyed (among other things) the
   vintage 1903 [122]Mellish telescope.

   Eastern Michigan's administration claims their college has one of the
   lowest overall crime rates in the nation.^[123][3]

   The picture to the right shows an art building that still stands on
   EMU's campus. Much of the building needed to be rebuilt. The telescope
   was also replaced, and students were able to view the Halle Comet's
   path in the late 1990s.

[[124]edit] Controversies

[[125]edit] Nicknames

   Since the 1991 season, Eastern Michigan University athletic teams have
   gone by the nickname "Eagles."

   EMU originally went by the nicknames "Normalites" and "Men from Ypsi"
   and various other titles down through the years before "Hurons" was
   adopted in 1929.

   The "Hurons" first came into being as the result of a contest sponsored
   by the Men's Union in 1929. On Oct. 31 of that year, a three-person
   committee, composed of Dr. Clyde Ford, Dr. Elmer Lyman and Professor
   Bert Peet, selected the name "Hurons" from the many entries in the
   contest.

   The name was submitted by two students, Gretchen Borst and George
   Hanner. The runner-up name in that contest was Pioneers.

   EMU began investigating the appropriateness of its Huron Indian logo
   after the Michigan Department of Civil Rights issued a report in
   October 1988 suggesting that all schools using such logos drop them.
   The report indicated that the use of Native American names, logos and
   mascots for athletic teams promoted racial stereotypes. At that time,
   four colleges, 62 high schools and 33 junior high/middle schools in
   Michigan used Native American logos or names, including
   [126]Mid-American Conference rival [127]Central Michigan University.
   CMU did not, however, change their nickname from the Chippewas.

   The EMU Board of Regents voted to replace the Huron name with Eagles,
   taken from three recommendations from a committee charged with
   supplying a new nickname. The other two final names submitted were
   Green Hornets and Express.

   The Eagles name was officially adopted on May 22, 1991, when the EMU
   Board of Regents voted to replace the existing Huron nickname and logo
   with the new one. During the [128]1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball
   Tournament, announcer [129]Brent Musburger talked about the controversy
   and referred to the team on-air as the "No-Names."

   The controversy over the nickname continues to this day, as many former
   students and faculty were angered that a unique name like Hurons was
   replaced by a common name like Eagles, especially for reasons of
   [130]political correctness. Some alumni have even refused to donate
   money to the school until the name Hurons is restored. A group called
   [131]Huron Restoration continues to try to bring back the name, and
   claims to have the support of Chief Leaford Bearskin of the
   [132]Wyandot Tribe of Oklahoma and former Grand Chief Max Gros-Louis of
   the [133]Huron-Wendat Nation of Quebec.[134][8]

[[135]edit] Laura Dickinson murder

   On December 15, 2006, EMU student Laura Dickinson's body was found in
   her dorm room at Hill Hall. EMU issued a statement the next day that
   foul play was not suspected, but EMU student Orange Amir Taylor III was
   arrested February 23, 2007 and charged with her rape and murder. Many
   Eastern Michigan students were especially skeptical of their
   university's compliance with the law because of this delay. According
   to police reports, the investigation was regarded as a homicide;
   however, this was denied and only officially announced on the day of
   Taylor's arrest. His arrest happened to be the first day students could
   not withdraw from classes and housing for a full refund.^[136][4] A
   subsequent investigation by Detroit law firm [137]Butzel Long found
   that EMU had violated the [138]Clery Act by not notifying students and
   named Vice President of Student Affairs, Jim Vick, as the main source
   of the cover-up.^[139][5] The report led the investigation of many
   high-level administrators.^[[140]citation needed]

   The nationally reported scandal resulted in the firing of President
   [141]John A. Fallon by the Board of Regents.^[142][6] He was notified
   of the unanimous vote of the Board to fire him by a letter sent to his
   home on July 15, 2007. Although no formal reason for the termination
   was given, his dismissal was considered by many to be a direct result
   of his role in the cover-up of the on-campus homicide. Eastern
   Michigan's Faculty Association President supported the Board's
   decision.

   At a special meeting called by the Board of Regents on Monday, July 16,
   2007, the separation of President John Fallon was officially announced
   along with the separation of Jim Vick, Vice President for Student
   Affairs and Cindy Hall, Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police.
   A letter of discipline was placed in University Counsel Kenneth
   McKanders' file.^[143][7] It was also announced that Donald Loppnow,
   Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, would be appointed
   Executive Vice President and in this role serve as Acting President
   until an Interim President is selected.^[144][8]

   As of July 3, 2007 the Department of Education report relating to the
   [145]Clery Act violations has been released to the public. It states,
   "Several findings of noncompliance were discovered during the review
   which the Department [of Education] considers to be serious violations
   of the Clery Act." The result of this report has yet to be seen. EMU
   released the executive summary of its response to the DOE report on
   July 27, 2007.^[146][9]^[147][10] In June 2008, the university
   announced that it had agreed to pay a fine of $350,000 for the
   violations of the Clery Act.^[148][11]

   On December 13, 2007, EMU settled with the family and estate of Laura
   Dickinson for $2.5 million. The settlement does not include any
   admission of liability by EMU.^[149][12]

   On April 7, 2008, a jury convicted Orange Taylor III of first-degree
   murder, assault with intent to commit sexual penetration, home
   invasion, and theft charges. ^[150][13] He was sentenced to life
   imprisonment on May 7, 2008. ^[151][14]

          Main article: [153]Eastern Michigan Eagles

   Eastern Michigan athletic teams have been successful on a national
   level, winning three [154]NCAA Division II national championships and
   13 [155]NAIA Division I national championships in five different sports
   (baseball, men's cross country, men's swimming and diving, men's indoor
   track and field, and men's outdoor track and field).

   EMU has also been [156]NCAA Division I national runner-up twice: in
   1940, the men's cross country team finished second to [157]Indiana
   University at the national meet hosted by [158]Michigan State
   University; then, on June 19, 1976, after finishing in sixth place the
   year before, the baseball team was defeated by the [159]University of
   Arizona in the final game of the [160]College World Series at
   [161]Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in [162]Omaha, [163]Nebraska. Eastern
   Michigan remains the last northern school to make to the NCAA Division
   I baseball championship game.

   Eastern's men's basketball team has appeared in four NCAA Division I
   tournaments, and have a 3-4 record, tied for third best among Michigan
   colleges. In the [164]1996 Men's Basketball Tournament, Eastern
   Michigan defeated the [165]Duke Blue Devils in the opening round; it
   would be the Blue Devils' last first- or second-round defeat until
   [166]2007, when they were upended by [167]VCU in the opening round.

   The Eagles have the most [168]MAC championships in a single sport, 26,
   in men's swimming and diving (1978, 1980-1996, 1998, 2000-2005, and
   2007).

   The 2006-2007 season was a successful one for Eastern Michigan, as they
   won an EMU and Mid-American Conference record eight conference titles:
   Men's Cross Country, Men's Swimming And Diving, Women's Swimming And
   Diving, Softball, Men's Indoor Track, Women's Gymnastics, Men's Golf
   and Men's Outdoor Track. This beat the school's previous record of five
   titles as well as the previous MAC record of six.

   Traditionally, Eastern's football teams have struggled, and the program
   has had problems attracting fans, partially due to their proximity to
   the powerful [169]University of Michigan just seven miles (11 km) away.
   After reaching a low point with a 27-game losing streak that was
   finally snapped in 1982, EMU started to become competitive. In 1987,
   EMU won its first Mid-American Conference title then defeated 17
   1/2-point favorite San Jose State in the [170]California Bowl. The 1988
   and 1989 teams each finished in second place in the conference and
   ended the most successful stretch of football in school history with
   its fourth straight winning season.

   Since being renamed as "Eagles" (cynics have suggested the new nickname
   has put a "hex" on the team) the football teams have returned to
   mediocrity, with just one winning season (1995). Despite the expansion
   of [171]Rynearson Stadium to 30,000 seats, drawing fans continues to be
   a problem: [172]NCAA rules state that in order to stay in Division I-A
   for football, each team must attract an average of 15,000 fans per
   game. During a 1-11 season in 2006, Eastern's EMU Foundation purchased
   5,000 tickets for local high school students to curb this threat to
   their status. EMU has also played one home game a year at [173]Ford
   Field in downtown [174]Detroit annually since 2004 in the "Collegiate
   Clash", where they have hosted [175]Central Michigan University (2004),
   [176]Western Michigan University (2005), the [177]United States Naval
   Academy (2006), and [178]Northwestern University on October 19, 2007.
   This appearance in Detroit is beneficial to their average attendance,
   as it usually gets around 25,000 fans. EMU often plays home games at
   night, so they won't interfere with U of M home games on the same day.
   Also, in recent years they have scheduled games on Thursday and Friday
   nights, which boosts student attendance (EMU is a majority commuter
   school, and even those who stay in the dorms often go home over
   weekends).

   EMU was a member of the [179]Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic
   Conference from 1950-1961.
