   The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. is a [39]non-profit [40]charitable
   organization headquartered in [41]San Francisco, [42]California, United
   States, and organized under the laws of the state of [43]Florida, where
   it was initially based. It operates several online collaborative
   [44]wiki projects including [45]Wikipedia, [46]Wiktionary,
   [47]Wikiquote, [48]Wikibooks (including [49]Wikijunior),
   [50]Wikisource, [51]Wikimedia Commons, [52]Wikispecies, [53]Wikinews,
   [54]Wikiversity, Wikimedia Incubator and [55]Meta-Wiki. Its flagship
   project, the [56]English-language Wikipedia, ranks among the top ten
   most-visited websites worldwide.^[57][4]

   The creation of the foundation was officially announced on the 20th of
   June, 2003 by [58]Wikipedia co-founder [59]Jimmy Wales,^[60][5] who had
   been operating Wikipedia under the aegis of his company
   [61]Bomis.^[62][6]

[[77]edit] Goals

   The Wikimedia Foundation falls under section [78]501(c)(3) of the US
   [79]Internal Revenue Code as a [80]public charity. Its [81]National
   Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) code is B60 ([82]Adult,
   [83]Continuing Education).^[84][7]^[85][8] The foundation's by-laws
   declare a statement of purpose of collecting and developing educational
   content and to disseminate it effectively and globally.^[86][9]

   The Wikimedia [87]Foundation's stated goal is to develop and maintain
   [88]open content, [89]wiki-based projects and to provide the full
   contents of those projects to the public [90]free of charge.^[91][10]

   In addition to the multilingual general [92]encyclopedia [93]Wikipedia,
   the foundation manages a multi-language [94]dictionary and
   [95]thesaurus named [96]Wiktionary, an encyclopedia of [97]quotations
   named [98]Wikiquote, a repository of source texts in any language named
   [99]Wikisource, and a collection of [100]e-book texts for students
   (such as [101]textbooks and annotated [102]public domain books) named
   [103]Wikibooks. [104]Wikijunior is a subproject of Wikibooks that
   specializes in books for children.

[[105]edit] Operations

   The continued technical and economic growth of each of the Wikimedia
   projects is dependent mostly on donations but the Wikimedia Foundation
   also increases its revenue by alternative means of funding such as
   [106]grants, sponsorship, services (datafeed) and brand merchandising.
   In March 2008 the foundation announced its largest donation to date: a
   three-year, $3 million grant from the [107]Alfred P. Sloan
   Foundation.^[108][11]

[[109]edit] History and growth

   The name "Wikimedia" was [110]coined by [111]Sheldon Rampton in a post
   to the English Wikipedia's mailing list in March 2003.^[112][12] The
   name has been criticized^[[113]citation needed] for its similarity to
   "[114]Wikipedia" and the software it runs on, "[115]MediaWiki"; this
   sometimes leads to confusion among people new to the project.

   With the foundation's announcement, Wales also transferred ownership of
   all Wikipedia, Wiktionary and [116]Nupedia [117]domain names to
   Wikimedia along with the copyrights for all materials related to these
   projects that were created by [118]Bomis employees or Wales himself.
   The computer equipment used to run all the Wikimedia projects was also
   donated by Wales to the foundation, which also acquired the [119]domain
   names "wikimedia.org" and "wikimediafoundation.org".

   In April 2005, the US [120]Internal Revenue Service approved (by
   letter) the foundation as an educational foundation in the category
   "[121]Adult, [122]Continuing Education", meaning all contributions to
   the Wikimedia Foundation are [123]tax deductible for U.S. federal
   income tax purposes.

   On December 11, 2006, the Wikimedia Foundation board noted that the
   corporation could not become the membership organization initially
   planned but never implemented due to an inability to meet the
   registration requirements of Florida Statute. Accordingly, the bylaws
   were amended to remove all reference to membership rights and
   activities. The decision to change the bylaws was passed by the board
   unanimously.

   On September 25, 2007, the Wikimedia Foundation board gave notice that
   the operations would be moving to the [124]San Francisco Bay Area.
   Major considerations cited for choosing San Francisco were proximity to
   like-minded organizations and potential partners as well as cheaper and
   more convenient international travel than is available from St.
   Petersburg.^[125][13]^[126][14]^[127][15]

[[128]edit] Board of Trustees

   This section may contain an [129]inappropriate mixture of prose and
   timeline. Please help [130]convert this timeline into [131]prose or, if
   necessary, a [132]list. (September 2008)

   In January 2004, [133]Jimmy Wales appointed his business partners
   [134]Tim Shell and Michael Davis to the board of the Wikimedia
   Foundation. In June 2004, an election was held for two user
   representative board members. Following one month of campaigning and
   two weeks of online voting, [135]Angela Beesley and [136]Florence
   Nibart-Devouard were elected to join the board. In late 2004, Wales and
   Beesley launched a startup company, [137]Wikia, affiliated with neither
   Wikimedia nor Bomis.^[[138]citation needed] In July 2005, Beesley and
   Nibart-Devouard were re-elected to the board.

   On July 1, 2006, Beesley resigned from the board effective upon
   election of her successor, expressing concern about "certain events and
   tendencies that have arisen within the organization since the start of
   this year," but stating her intent to continue to participate in the
   Wikimedia projects, and in the formation of an Australian chapter. A
   special election was held in September to finish Beesley's term, ending
   with the mid-2007 election. The election was won by [139]Erik Mller.

   In October 2006, Nibart-Devouard replaced Wales as chair of the
   Foundation. On December 8, 2006, the board expanded to seven people
   with the appointments of Kat Walsh and Oscar van Dillen. Effective
   December 15, 2006, [140]Jan-Bart de Vreede was appointed to replace
   Shell.

   In the June 2007 election, Mller and Walsh were reelected; van Dillen,
   who ran for re-election, was narrowly edged by Frieda Brioschi.

   Davis left the board in November 2007. Nibart-Devouard's elected term
   expires in June 2008. The appointed terms for Wales and de Vreede
   expire in December 2008. Brioschi's and Walsh's elected terms expire in
   June 2009.

   In December 2007, Mller resigned from the Board of Trustees, and was
   hired as the foundation's deputy director by the executive director.

   In February 2008, Florence Devouard announced the addition of two new
   board members: Michael Snow, an American lawyer and chair of the
   Communication Committee; and Domas Mituzas, a Lithuanian computer
   software engineer, MySQL employee, and longtime member of the core tech
   team.^[141][16]

   In April 2008, the board announced a restructuring of its membership,
   increasing the number of board positions to 10 overall, as follows:
     * Three community-elected seats
     * Two seats to be selected by the chapters
     * One board-appointed 'community founder' seat, to be occupied by
       Jimmy Wales
     * Four board-appointed 'specific expertise' seats^[142][17]

   In the June 2008 board election, Ting Chen was elected for a one-year
   term, then Frieda Brioschi resigned to be alected at the board of
   [143]Wikimedia Italia.

[[144]edit] Volunteer committees and positions

   In 2004, the foundation appointed Tim Starling as developer liaison to
   help improve the [145]MediaWiki software, Daniel Mayer as [146]chief
   financial officer ([147]finance, [148]budgeting and coordination of
   fund drives), and [149]Erik Mller as content partnership coordinator.

   In May 2005, the foundation announced the appointment of seven people
   to official positions:^[150][18]
     * Brion Vibber as chief technical officer (Vibber was also an
       employee of the Foundation, with other duties)
     * Domas Mituzas as hardware officer
     * Jens Frank as developer liaison
     * Mller as chief research officer
     * Danny Wool as grants coordinator
     * Elisabeth Bauer as press officer
     * Jean-Baptiste Soufron as lead legal coordinator

   Mller resigned in August 2005, due to differences with the board, and
   was replaced by James Forrester. In February 2007, Forrester resigned,
   and the board appointed Gregory Maxwell to the position, renamed "chief
   research coordinator".^[151][19]

   In January 2006, the foundation created several committees, including
   the Communication Committee, in an attempt to further organize
   activities essentially handled by volunteers at that time.^[152][20]
   Starling resigned that month to spend more time on his PhD program.

[[153]edit] Employees

   Organization chart as of January 2008^[154][21]

   The functions of the Wikimedia Foundation were, for the first few
   years, executed almost entirely by volunteers. In 2005, the foundation
   had only two employees, Danny Wool, a coordinator, and Brion Vibber, a
   software manager. Though the number of employees has grown, the
   foundation's staff is still very small, and the bulk of foundation work
   continues to be done by volunteers.

   The current staff are listed on the Foundation website, [155]here.

   As of October 4, 2006, the Wikimedia Foundation had five paid
   employees:^[156][22] two programmers, an administrative assistant, a
   coordinator handling fundraising and grants, and an interim
   [157]executive director,^[158][23] Brad Patrick, previously the
   foundation's [159]general counsel. Patrick ceased his activity as
   interim director in January 2007, and then resigned from his position
   as legal counsel, effective April 1, 2007. He was replaced by [160]Mike
   Godwin as general counsel and legal coordinator in July 2007.^[161][24]
   Three further technical contractors were also appointed in December
   2006: part-time hardware manager Kyle Anderson in Tampa, full-time
   MediaWiki software developer Tim Starling, and part-time networking
   coordinator Mark Bergsma.

   In January 2007, Carolyn Doran was named [162]chief operating officer
   and Sandy Ordonez came on board as [163]head of
   communications.^[164][25] Doran had begun working as a part-time
   bookkeeper in 2006 after being sent by a [165]temporary agency. Doran
   later left the foundation in July 2007, and [166]Sue Gardner was hired
   as consultant and special advisor (later CEO). Some months after
   Doran's departure, it was identified^[167][26] that she was a convicted
   [168]felon, with a [169]DUI arrest during her tenure at the foundation
   and a substantial criminal history, including shooting her boyfriend
   and complicity in credit card forgery.^[170][27] Her departure from the
   organization was cited as one of the reasons the foundation took about
   seven months to release its fiscal 2007 financial audit.^[171][28]

   Danny Wool, officially the grant coordinator but also largely involved
   in fundraising and business development, resigned in March 2007. In
   February 2007, the foundation added a new position, chapters
   coordinator, and hired Delphine Mnard ^[172][29], who had been
   occupying the position as a volunteer since August 2005. Cary Bass was
   hired in March 2007 in the position of [173]volunteer coordinator. In
   May 2007, Vishal Patel was hired to assist in business
   development.^[174][30] Oleta McHenry was brought in as accountant in
   May, 2007, through a temporary placement agency and made the official
   fulltime accountant in August, 2007. In [175]January 2008, the
   foundation appointed three new staff: Veronique Kessler as the new
   chief financial and operating officer, [176]Kul Wadhwa to replace
   Vishal Patel as head of business development, and [177]Jay Walsh as
   [178]head of communications.

   In June 2008, the foundation announced two staff additions in
   fundraising: Rebecca Handler as major gifts officer and Rand Montoya as
   head of community giving.^[179][31] Soon afterward, Sara Crouse was
   hired as head of partnerships and foundation relations.^[180][32] In
   fall 2008, the foundation hired three software developers: Tomasz Finc,
   Ariel Glenn, and Trevor Parscal.^[181][33]

[[243]edit] Finances

          Main article: [244]Finance report

   The Wikimedia Foundation relies on public contributions and grants to
   fund its mission of providing free knowledge to every person in the
   world.^[245][36] It is exempt from federal income
   tax^[246][36]^[247][37] and from state income tax.^[248][36]^[249][38]
   It is not a private foundation, and contributions to it qualify as
   tax-deductible charitable contributions.^[250][36]

   At the beginning of 2006, the foundation's [251]net assets were
   $270,000. During the year, the organization received support and
   revenue totaling $1,510,000, with concurrent expenses of $790,000.
   [252]Net assets increased by $720,000 to a total of over one million
   dollars.^[253][36] In 2007, the foundation continued to expand, ending
   the year with net assets of $1,700,000.^[254][39] Both income and
   expenses nearly doubled in 2007.^[255][39]

[[256]edit] Local chapters

   Wikimedia projects have an international scope. To continue this
   success on an organizational level, Wikimedia is building an
   international network of associated organizations.

   [257]Local chapters are self-dependent organizations that share the
   goals of the Wikimedia Foundation and support them within a specified
   geographical region. They support the foundation, the Wikimedia
   community and Wikimedia projects in different ways  by collecting
   donations, organizing local events and projects and spreading the word
   of Wikimedia, free content and Wiki culture. They also provide the
   community and potential partners with a point of contact capable of
   fulfilling specific local needs.

   Local chapters are self-dependent associations with no legal control of
   nor responsibility for the websites of the Wikimedia Foundation and
   vice versa.
