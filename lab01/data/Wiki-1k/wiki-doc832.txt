Rice/Poindexter Case

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Ed Poindexter)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   [9]Omahans David Rice (now known as Mondo we Langa) and Edward
   Poindexter were charged and convicted of the murder of [10]Omaha Police
   Officer Larry Minard. Minard died when a suitcase containing
   [11]dynamite exploded in a [12]North Omaha home on [13]August 17,
   [14]1970. Officer John Tess was also injured in the explosion.

   Poindexter and Rice were members of the [15]Black Panther Party, and
   their case was, and continues to be, controversial. The Omaha Police
   withheld exculpatory evidence at trial. The two men had been targeted
   by the FBI's [16]COINTELPRO (Counter Intelligence Program), which
   operated against and infiltrated anti-war and Civil Rights groups,
   including the Omaha Black Panthers^[17][1]. The US section of
   [18]Amnesty International recognizes Rice and Poindexter as political
   prisoners ^[19][2]. The state's parole board have recommended the men
   for release, but political leaders have not acted on these
   recommendations.^[20][3].

[[37]edit] Rice and Poindexter

   David Rice was born in Omaha in 1949, graduated from [38]Creighton
   Preparatory School and took courses at [39]Creighton University. Both
   are Catholic institutions of learning. He wrote for the local
   underground paper, [40]Buffalo Chip, from 1969 to 1970 and was a member
   of the [41]Black Panther Party (BPP). He played guitar at [42]Holy
   Family Roman Catholic Church, a center of progressive activism in the
   1960s and 70's under the pastorate of Fr. John McCaslin. Rice also ran
   a breakfast program for inner-city youth and was a well-known community
   activist. Today David Rice/Mondo we Langa is a published poet and
   playwright. Even writing from prison, he has become a major voice for
   justice and the arts in Nebraska.

   Ed Poindexter was born on November 1, 1944. He is a [43]Vietnam
   veteran. Like Rice, Poindexter was a community activist in North Omaha.
   He too has published plays, and has also published various materials
   educating and motivating prison inmates who are near release. While in
   prison, he earned his Master's degree. He also suffered from diabetes,
   which went untreated in Nebraska prisons. He was eventually transferred
   to a Minnesota prison, where he received appropriate care.He is now
   back in the Nebraska State Penitentury

[[44]edit] Context of the Events in the summer of 1970

   In the wake of the assassination of [45]Martin Luther King, Jr., racial
   tensions in cities across America were high. In March 1968, riots in
   Omaha led to the shooting of a local high school student during an
   event in support of segregationist [46]George Wallace's presidential
   campaign. In the summer of 1970, there was a rash of bombings in the
   midwest. Five bombings had occurred in neighboring [47]Iowa, explosions
   occurred in [48]Wisconsin and [49]Minnesota, and both a police precinct
   and the Component Concept Corporation suffered bomb damage in Omaha.
   Members of the Black Panther Party were the prime suspects in these
   bombings. In July, a warrant was issued to search Omaha BPP
   headquarters for bomb making materials. Luther Payne, a former BPP
   member, was arrested in Omaha for possessing [50]dynamite.

[[51]edit] August 17

   A call was made to the police reporting a woman screaming at a vacant
   house near 28th and Ohio Street^[52][4]. Patrolman Michael Lamson and
   five other members of the [53]Omaha Police Department (OPD) responded
   to the call. They noticed a suitcase sitting in the front room. Shortly
   afterward, Patrolmen Larry Minard and John Tess arrived. With Tess
   looking on, Minard picked up the suitcase. The resultant explosion
   killed him and seriously injured Tess.

[[54]edit] Duane Peak

   After hiding out for over a week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime
   on August 28. He confessed to placing the bag and implicated six
   others, but mentioned neither Rice nor Poindexter. In a later
   statement, Peak told police that Rice and Poindexter had made the bomb,
   told him to plant it, and to lure the police to the vacant house with
   an anonymous phone call.

   This led to the charging of Poindexter and Rice with murder on August
   31.

   In an interview with the [55]Washington Post on January 8, 1978, County
   Prosecutor Art O'Leary admitted that he had made a deal with Duane Peak
   to prosecute him as a juvenile in return for his testimony. O'Leary
   acknowledged that without Peak's testimony, the pair would not have
   been convicted.

[[56]edit] The Trial

[[57]edit] Preliminary Hearing

   At a preliminary hearing on September 28, Peak took the stand and
   recanted his story, testifying instead that neither Poindexter nor Rice
   were involved. After a recess, Peak changed his testimony yet again and
   implicated Poindexter and Rice. Peak was at that time wearing dark
   glasses, which he removed at the request of Rice's attorney, David
   Herzog. Peak appeared to those present to have been beaten. Herzog
   asked Peak if he had been threatened during the recess, and if he had
   discussed his confession to help him remember it. Peak replied in the
   affirmative to both questions, telling the court that his [58]lawyer
   was not present when he discussed his confession with county attorney
   O'Leary.^[59][5].

[[60]edit] April 1971 Trial

   Poindexter and Rice were tried in [61]Douglas County District Court by
   a jury consisting of eleven white jurors and one black juror.
   Deliberations lasted four days before both men were found guilty. Judge
   Donald A. Hamilton sentenced them to life in prison. The lone black
   juror later stated that he voted with the majority on the condition
   that the death sentence was not requested.

   The case was built upon both Duane Peak's testimony and evidence that
   Rice and Poindexter had been involved in the manufacture of dynamite
   explosives such as the ones used in the bombing. Three pieces of
   dynamite the police claimed to have found in David Rice's basement were
   similar to that used in the bomb. Also found in Rice's house were
   needle-nosed pliers with copper shavings matching wire found at the
   scene of the bombing. Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau witness
   Roland Wilder suggested there were more dissimilarities between the
   samples than similarities. Also, the prosecution claimes that ammonia
   dynamite particles were found in Poindexter's jacket pocket and Rice's
   pants pocket. The chemist, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms lab worker
   Kenneth Snow, conceded at the trial that these traces could have come
   from matches. To establish the characters of the pair, the prosecutor
   presented the court with newsletter articles in which Rice and
   Poindexter publicly advocated violence toward police. ^[62][6].

[[63]edit] Controversy over Evidence

   In addition to Peak's testimony, the state offered three pieces of
   dynamite found in Rice's home as evidence. The officers could not find
   Rice's or Poindexter's fingerprints on the dynamite, and were not clear
   as to the exact location of the dynamite in Rice's house. Accusations
   have been made that the dynamite was planted, suspicions which were
   even held by ex-Omaha police officer Marvin McClarty, who described the
   search of Rice's house as having deviated significantly from accepted
   police procedure.

   In at least one of the appeals, a judge declared that the search of
   Rice's house where the dynamite was found was illegal and
   inadmissible.^[64][7]. Shortly after Rice's conviction, his house
   burned to the ground. This eliminated any possibility of exploring the
   accuracy of police testimony about the dynamite.

   Luther Payne and his associates were not discussed in the proceedings
   of the trial. After the trial, charges against Payne and his associates
   were dropped, although skin tests found that one of the men had
   recently handled dynamite. Skin tests for Rice and Poindexter were
   negative. Peak was not tested.

   In 2005, the tape of the emergency 911 call that lured police to the
   North Omaha home was discovered. The tape had been suppressed at trial.
   At that time, the Omaha Police had claimed that it had been destroyed;
   an FBI memo released after a Freedom of Information Act request
   demonstrates that the FBI's COINTELPRO program advised the Omaha
   authorities to suppress the tape. Expert analysis hired by the defense
   determined that the voice on the tape was not the voice of Duane
   Peak--the only witness to claim first-hand knowledge of the murder.
   This renewed community appeals for Poindexter and Rice to be released.

   Peak claimed that he lowered his voice to disguise it. In the weeks
   after the bombing, Peak's brother was said to have identified the voice
   as Peak's.^[65][8].

[[66]edit] Circumstantial Evidence

   The state also brought forward as evidence at trial political
   literature the two men had written. These included the opinion that "I
   believe that pigs look very good roasting on a stick... Barbecue for
   the pig,", which had been published by "David L. Rice, Deputy Minister
   of Information," in a 1970 publication of the United Front Against
   Fascism.^[67][9]. These articles were among many published by various
   political groups in the context of the [68]Vietnam War and the
   [69]Civil Rights Movement. Former Nebraska Governor [70]Frank B.
   Morrison, who had represented Poindexter at his trial, is quoted: "The
   reason they were suspected was because they were members of the Black
   Panthers. [Authorities] had a couple of young Blacks who everybody knew
   used incendiary language -- hateful things that irritated the police.
   They weren't convicted of murder. They were convicted of rhetoric. The
   only thing these young fellas did was try to combat all the racial
   discrimination of the time the wrong way."

   In a 1990 [71]BBC documentary about the case, the officer in charge of
   the investigation, Detective Jack Swanson, affirmed the Omaha Police
   Department's fear of the Black Panther Party: "We feel we got the two
   main players in Rice and Poindexter, and I think we did the right thing
   at the time, because the Black Panther Party ... completely disappeared
   from the city of Omaha ... and it's ... been the end of that sort of
   thing in the city of Omaha -- and that's 21 years ago."

[[72]edit] Appeals

   At David Rice's [73]appeal in March 1974, Judge Warren Urbom of the
   [74]Federal District Court found that the police had no evidence to
   allow a search of his home, where they had allegedly found the
   dynamite. Judge Urbom also noted the inconsistencies in a Police
   Lieutenant's testimony about the reasons for a search warrant, and
   concluded "[I]t is impossible for me to credit his testimony". He
   overturned Rice's conviction and ordered a new trial in which the
   evidence of the dynamite could not be used to corroborate the state's
   case. This ruling was upheld by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in
   1975.

   The State of Nebraska then appealed to the [75]U.S. Supreme Court. The
   Supreme Court was in the process of ruling on a landmark case,
   [76]Stone v. Powell (July 6, 1976), which in a decision taken together
   with Wolff v. Rice, the Court held that where states had provided
   opportunities for full and fair litigation of Fourth Amendment claims,
   the Constitution did not require the granting of federal habeas corpus
   relief.

   As a result, David Rice had to go through state courts to decide the
   question of the legality of the search of his house. However, the
   Nebraska Supreme Court refused to hear his case on the grounds that the
   time limit for appealing through the state court had been exhausted
   ^[77][10].

[[78]edit] COINTELPRO

   After [79]COINTELPRO became public (in 1977) and the [80]Freedom of
   Information Act was passed (in 1978), Rice and Poindexter were able to
   access their FBI files. Each file was over a thousand pages long,
   though they only received small portions upon request. In 1978, Amnesty
   International published a report finding that irregular conduct by the
   FBI during its COINTELPRO operations had undermined the fairness of
   trials of a number of political activists during the 1970s. This led to
   the 1980 conviction (and 1981 pardon by [81]President [82]Ronald W.
   Reagan) of FBI Director [83]L. Patrick Gray and Agent [84]Edward S.
   Miller. However, beyond the general campaign to discredit and smear BPP
   members, the particular links between COINTELPRO and this case were
   uncertain until Senator [85]Chuck Hagel facilitated release on over a
   thousand pages of relevant documents in 2001.

[[86]edit] Commuting Sentences

   Since 1993, the Nebraska Parole Board has voted unanimously and
   repeatedly to commute both men's sentences to time served. As of
   September 2005, the Nebraska Board of Pardons has refused to schedule a
   hearing in the matter. One Board member has even asserted that there
   are "no circumstances" under which he would consider commutation.

[[87]edit] [88]Cause clbre

   David Rice and Ed Poindexter have become folk heroes of a sort, along
   with [89]Leonard Peltier. These men are often called [90]political
   prisoners, as their arrests and convictions were marred by
   circumstantial evidence and police falsehoods, and occurred in a time
   of intense political turmoil. Controversial Omaha police officer,
   [91]Tariq Al-Amin, has led the charge in Omaha for the freedom of Rice
   and Poindexter. Their case has gained the support of luminaries such as
   [92]Danny Glover and [93]Angela Davis. [94]Amnesty International and
   the [95]NAACP are among the national organizations which support the
   immediate release of the two men.
