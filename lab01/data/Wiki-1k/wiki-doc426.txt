[[65]edit] History

   A club was set up in the area around 1918 and were known as O'Carolan's
   Gortnaghey.^[66][2] St. Colms's GAC Drum was officially founded in
   1937. The club's first major honour came in 1940 when they won the Dr.
   Kerlin Cup and in 1941 they won the club's biggest honour to date a
   year late; the Derry Senior Football League. Five years later, after
   winning the North Derry Senior Football Championship, the club reached
   the [67]Derry Senior Football Championship final, only to be denied by
   [68]Magherafelt in a close encounter. Drum reached another Derry Senior
   Championship final in 1956, but were defeated by [69]Bellaghy. In that
   year Eugene McCaul, Samus McCloskey from Drum were part of Derry's
   first ever [70]All-Ireland Minor Football Championship winning side.

   In the late 1960s and early 1970s Drum and rivals [71]Foreglen combined
   to play as Muldonagh, but soon went their separate ways again.
   [72]Peter Stevenson from the club won an [73]All Star in 1975 for his
   performances for Derry in that year's [74]Championship. Having slipped
   down to the Juinor ranks, in 1977 Drum won the [75]Derry Junior
   Football Championship, Division 3 of the league and the Neil Carlin
   Cup. In 1974 Drum reached the first of their four [76]Derry
   Intermediate Football Championship finals, losing out to [77]Glack.
   [78]Greenlough denied them in the 1976 decider, [79]Glen in 1983 and
   [80]Moneymore in 1984.

   In 1989 St. Colm's opened their new pitch at a cost of 75,000. It was
   opened by Bishop Lagan at an [81]Antrim versus [82]Kilkenny hurling
   match followed by [83]Derry versus [84]Meath football match. That year
   the club received the Gerry Crossan Memorial Cup for North Derry Club
   of the Year. In 1992 Drum's Neil Farren, Sen More, Shauna McCaul and
   Julie Colgan all won Derry [85]handball titles. St. Colm's became Derry
   Junior Football Champions again in 1994, with a victory over [86]Eoghan
   Rua in the final. A new pavilion was completed in May 1995 and Drum won
   the following year's Neil Carlin Cup with victory over [87]Doire
   Colmcille CLG, and also won the club's fifth Derry Junior Championship.
   Cousins Niall and Eoghan Farren were rewarded with Bank of Ireland
   Colleges All Stars following their performances for [88]St. Pats
   College Maghera. Drum retained the Neil Carlin Cup in 1997 with victory
   over [89]Ardmore.

   In 2000 St. Colm's won the Fair Play League, rewarding their sporting
   conduct both on and off the field. Drum hurler, Shane McCartney claimed
   consecutive [90]Ulster Senior Hurling Championships with Derry in 2000
   and 2001. They won the [91]Derry Intermediate Hurling Championship in
   2003 and the club's sixth Junior Football Championship came in 2006
   after a comeback against [92]Lissan.

   They also made it to the final in 2007 but lost to Lissan. In 2008,
   under the management of former Derry captain Joe Irwin, they lost a
   promotion playoff to Limavady.
