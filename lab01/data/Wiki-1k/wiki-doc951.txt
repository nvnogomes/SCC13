[[26]edit] Education and career

   Michael Green was born in 1930. His mother was Australian and his
   father was Welsh. He was converted through the ministry of [27]E J H
   Nash ("Bash").^[28][1] Educated at [29]Clifton College. He studied at
   [30]Exeter College, Oxford ([31]Bachelor of Arts 1953, [32]Master of
   Arts 1956), and subsequently at [33]Queens' College, Cambridge
   ([34]Bachelor of Arts 1957, [35]Master of Arts 1961, [36]Bachelor of
   Divinity 1966) while preparing for ordained ministry at [37]Ridley
   Hall. He has been admitted to the degree of [38]Doctor of Divinity by
   the [39]Archbishop of Canterbury (1996) and the [40]University of
   Toronto (1992). He was ordained [41]deacon in 1957, [42]priest in 1958.

   He served as [43]Assistant Curate of [44]Eastbourne [45]Holy Trinity
   1957-60, Tutor at [46]London College of Divinity 1960-69, Principal of
   [47]St John's College, Nottingham 1969-75, and [48]Rector of [49]St
   Aldate's, Oxford 1975-86. He had additionally been an [50]Honorary
   Canon of [51]Coventry Cathedral from 1970 until 1978. He then moved to
   [52]Canada, where he was Professor of Evangelism at [53]Regent College,
   [54]Vancouver from 1987 until 1992. He returned to [55]England to take
   up the position of Advisor to the [56]Archbishop of Canterbury and the
   [57]Archbishop of York for the [58]Springboard Decade of Evangelism. In
   1993 he was appointed Six Preacher of [59]Canterbury Cathedral. Despite
   having officially retired in 1996, he became [60]Senior Research Fellow
   and Head of Evangelism and Apologetics at [61]Wycliffe Hall, Oxford in
   1997 and lives in the village of [62]Marston, near [63]Oxford.

   He is married to Rosemary, and they have four adult children, Sarah
   (who lives in Northern Ireland), Jenny, Tim, and Jonathan.

[[64]edit] Apologetics & evangelism

   Green has been a prolific writer, with much of his work written for a
   popular reading audience, although he has also contributed to academic
   studies. Many of his best known books discuss the twin topics of
   evangelism and [65]apologetics.

   One of Green's objectives has been to equip lay Christian believers in
   their grasp of the gospel message, and to then have confidence to
   converse with others about faith matters. These practical objectives
   are very clear in books such as Evangelism, Now and Then and Sharing
   Your Faith With Friends and Family. At a technical level Green has
   contributed a valuable academic study of the [66]praxis and theory of
   evangelism in Evangelism in the Early Church. This work explores the
   development of evangelism through the New Testament texts and from the
   early church fathers, and is a basic text in Christian missions. He has
   built on those foundational studies in his advocacy of evangelism at a
   parish church level, both through his personal ministry and in his book
   Evangelism Through the Local Church.

   His apologetic work has generally focussed on popular misconceptions
   and objections held by non-Christians. In books such as You Must Be
   Joking, World on the Run and Why Bother With Jesus, Green deals with
   attitudes of religious indifference and scepticism. He also addresses a
   variety of objections concerning religious hypocrisy, [67]religious
   pluralism, and popular questions of doubt and unbelief. He has also
   examined the evidences for the life, death and [68]resurrection of
   Christ in Man Alive and again in the revision of that book The Day
   Death Died.

   Green has also explored academic challenges to faith, such as in the
   collection of essays he prepared as a reply to [69]Don Cupitt's work on
   The Myth of God Incarnate. In that analysis Green and his colleagues
   addressed the problems of myth and history as propounded in modern
   biblical scholarship, especially concerning the relationship between
   the events of Jesus' ministry and teaching, and the doctrine of the
   [70]Incarnation.

   His recent work The Books the Church Suppressed: Fiction and Truth in
   The Da Vinci Code is an argument for Orthodox Christianity against
   Gnosticism, as it is presented in The Da Vinci Code. Green here links
   Gnosticism with a decline in society (pp 152-4). He also claims that
   Gnosticism leads to a decline in morality, so that by ordaining a
   homosexual bishop, the Episcopal Church of the United States has itself
   shown Gnostic tendencies (pp 154-161).

   He has considered aspects of apologetic methodology and strategy in his
   co-authored work with [71]Alister McGrath.

   Aside from his apologetic writings, Green has also addressed issues of
   discipleship in the Christian life, ministry and leadership in the
   church, the doctrine of [72]baptism, pneumatology (the Holy Spirit) and
   [73]demonology. He has also written non-technical commentaries on
   certain books of the New Testament.

   Adventure of Faith is his spiritual autobiography.

[[74]edit] Humorous reference

   Michael Green was a good-natured victim of the [75]Hoax letter writers
   The Reverend Toby Forward and The Reverend David Johnson, writing under
   the pseudonym [76]Francis Wagstaffe. They describe him as "the famous
   evangelist and mild arsonist" in letters to [77]Euston Films, [78]Roy
   Jenkins, and [79]Hodder & Stoughton. They received a letter from Dr
   Green in which he admitted, "I had a fairly wild time before becoming a
   committed Christian: that included things like a little mild arson, but
   not fornication!" (p. 71) There was a serious point behind his
   repudiating any involvement with fornication: as [80]Rector of [81]St
   Aldate's he famously had a sofa in his study, "where scores of people
   knelt to entrust their lives to Christ!" (ibid.)
