   The [57]economy of [58]South Korea is a highly [59]developed^[60][1]
   [61]trillion dollar economy that is the [62]fourth largest in Asia and
   [63]13th largest in the world. It sustained double-digit [64]economic
   growth for decades, growing faster than any other major economy in the
   20th century. South Korea's overnight transformation to a wealthy
   [65]developed country in less than half a century is often called the
   [66]Miracle on the Han River and earned the distinctive reputation of
   "[67]Asian Tiger" in the international community.

   Today, South Korea is classified as a [68]High-income economy by the
   [69]World Bank and an [70]Advanced economy by the [71]IMF and [72]CIA.
   Its capital, [73]Seoul, is a major [74]global city and a leading
   [75]international financial centre in Asia.^[76][2] South Koreans enjoy
   one of the highest [77]living standards in the world and have a high
   [78]life expectancy and a high level of [79]economic freedom.

   Like [80]West Germany and [81]Japan, rapid [82]industrialization since
   the 1960s has made South Korea one of the world's top ten
   [83]exporters. An extremely competitive [84]education system and a
   highly skilled and motivated [85]workforce are two key factors driving
   this [86]knowledge economy that has the world's highest [87]scientific
   literacy^[88][3] and second highest [89]mathematical literacy.^[90][3]

   It boasts the world's highest [91]broadband internet access per
   capita^[92][4] and is the most [93]wired country in the world.^[94][5]
   In 2007, the [95]Economist Intelligence Unit ranked South Korea's
   [96]IT Industry Competitiveness among the top three in the
   world^[97][6].

   South Korean has many well known global [98]conglomerates such as
   [99]Samsung, [100]Hyundai-Kia, [101]LG and [102]SK. In 2006,
   [103]Samsung Group alone would have been the world's 34th largest
   economy if ranked.^[104][7] In 2007, the [105]Hyundai Kia Automotive
   Group became [106]Asia's second largest [107]car company and one of the
   top five [108]automakers in the world.

   While the [109]global financial crisis of 2008 has led to a financial
   collapse and economic decline in the [110]G7 and [111]European
   economies, Korea has also been hit by the crisis. As of early February
   2009 the Korean Won has fallen 31% in value vs. the US Dollar in the
   past year.^[112][8] The Korean economy shrank 3.4% year over year in
   the fourth quarter of 2008, and the benchmark stock index lost almost
   41% of its value for 2008.^[113][9]

[[140]edit] History

   Following [141]Japanese rule and the [142]Korean War, the [143]Syngman
   Rhee administration of the newly formed South Korean state used
   [144]foreign aid from the [145]United States during the 1950s to build
   an infrastructure that included a nationwide network of primary and
   secondary schools, modern roads, and a modern communications network.
   The result was that by 1961, South Korea had a well-educated young work
   force and a modern infrastructure that provided a solid foundation for
   economic growth.South Korea signed in 1965 to [146]Treaty on Basic
   Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea. Hereby, South Korea
   received $800 million in grants and soft loans from Japan as
   compensation for its colonial rule in the treaty.The South Korea
   government spent most of its money establishing social infrastructures
   and corporation,founding [147]POSCO,building [148]Gyeongbu Expressway
   and the Soyang River Dam.^[149][10]

[[150]edit] Rapid growth from 1960s to 1980s

   South Korea is one of the world's top five [151]automakers, led by
   [152]Hyundai and [153]Kia.

   South Korea's real [154]gross national product expanded by an average
   of more than 8 percent per year, from US$3.3 billion in 1962 to US$204
   billion in 1989. Per capita annual income grew from US$87 in 1962 to
   US$4,830 in 1989. The manufacturing sector grew from 14.3 percent of
   the GNP in 1962 to 30.3 percent in 1987. Commodity trade volume rose
   from US$480 million in 1962 to a projected US$127.9 billion in 1990.
   The ratio of [155]domestic savings to GNP grew from 3.3 percent in 1962
   to 35.8 percent in 1989.

   The most significant factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption
   of an outward-looking strategy in the early 1960s. This strategy was
   particularly well suited to that time because of South Korea's poor
   natural resource endowment, low savings rate, and tiny domestic market.
   The strategy promoted economic growth through labor-intensive
   manufactured exports, in which South Korea could develop a competitive
   advantage. Government initiatives played an important role in this
   process. The inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to
   supplement the shortage of domestic savings. These efforts enabled
   South Korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases
   in income.

   By emphasizing the industrial sector, Seoul's export-oriented
   development strategy left the rural sector relatively underdeveloped.
   Increasing income disparity between the industrial and agricultural
   sectors became a serious problem by the 1970s and remained a problem,
   despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural
   living standards.

[[156]edit] Stability

   In the early 1980s, in order to control inflation, a conservative
   [157]monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted. Growth of
   the [158]money supply was reduced from the 30 percent level of the
   1970s to 15 percent. Seoul even froze its budget for a short while.
   Government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies
   on imports and foreign investment were liberalized to promote
   competition. To reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors,
   Seoul expanded investments in public projects, such as roads and
   communications facilities, while further promoting farm
   [159]mechanization.

   These measures, coupled with significant improvements in the world
   economy, helped the South Korean economy regain its lost momentum in
   the late 1980s. South Korea achieved an average of 9.2 percent real
   growth between 1982 and 1987 and 12.5 percent between 1986 and 1988.
   The double digit [160]inflation of the 1970s was brought under control.
   [161]Wholesale price inflation averaged 2.1 percent per year from 1980
   through 1988; consumer prices increased by an average of 4.7 percent
   annually. Seoul achieved its first significant surplus in its balance
   of payments in 1986 and recorded a US$7.7 billion and a US$11.4 billion
   surplus in 1987 and 1988 respectively. This development permitted South
   Korea to begin reducing its level of [162]foreign debt. The trade
   surplus for 1989, however, was only US$4.6 billion dollars, and a small
   negative balance was projected for 1990.

[[163]edit] 1990s and 2000s

   South Koreans enjoy one of the highest [164]living standards in Asia,
   with a high [165]income per capita and a high degree of [166]economic
   freedom.

   In recent years South Korea's economy moved away from the centrally
   planned, government-directed investment model toward a more
   market-oriented one. South Korea bounced back from the [167]1997 Asian
   Financial Crisis and carried out extensive [168]financial reforms that
   restored stability to markets. Growth plunged by 6.6% in 1998, then
   strongly recovered to 10.8% in 1999 and 9.2% in 2000. These economic
   reforms, pushed by President [169]Kim Dae-jung, helped Korea maintain
   one of Asia's few expanding economies, with growth rates of 10.8% in
   1999 and 9.2% in 2000. Growth fell back to 3.3% in 2001 because of the
   slowing global economy, falling exports, and the perception that
   much-needed corporate and financial reforms have stalled. Led by
   industry and construction, growth in 2002 was 5.8%, despite anemic
   global growth.^[[170]citations needed] Restructuring of Korean
   conglomerates ([171]chaebols), bank privatization, and creating a more
   liberalized economy with a mechanism for bankrupt firms to exit the
   market remain Korea's most important unfinished reform
   tasks.^[[172]neutrality disputed] Growth slowed again in 2004, but
   production expanded 5% in 2006, due to popular demand for key export
   products such as [173]HDTVs and [174]mobile phones.^[[175]citation
   needed]

   South Korea relies largely upon exports to fuel the growth of its
   economy, with finished products such as electronics, textiles, ships,
   automobiles, and steel being some of its most important exports.
   Although the import market has liberalized in recent years, the
   agricultural market has remained largely [176]protectionist due to
   serious disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such
   as rice with the international market. As of 2005, the price of rice in
   South Korea is about four times that of the average price of rice on
   the international market, and it was generally feared that opening the
   agricultural market would have disastrous effects upon the South Korean
   agricultural sector. In late 2004, however, an agreement was reached
   with the [177]WTO in which South Korean rice imports will gradually
   increase from 4% to 8% of consumption by 2014. In addition, up to 30%
   of imported rice will be made available directly to consumers by 2010,
   where previously imported rice was only used for processed foods.
   Following 2014, the South Korean rice market will be fully
   opened.^[[178]citations needed]

   Korea was heavily affected by the economic crisis of 2008. Following
   the bankruptcy of a major Korean institution, the korean won lost up to
   30% of its value, and the Government of Korea was forced to introduce a
   major stimulus package to stimulate the economy.

[[179]edit] Government role

          See also: [180]Five-year plans of South Korea

[[181]edit] Under Park Chung Hee

   South Korea is the world's largest [182]shipbuilding nation and one of
   the top ten [183]exporters in the world.

   In 1961 General [184]Park Chung Hee overthrew the popularly elected
   regime of Prime Minister [185]Chang Myon. A nationalist, Park wanted to
   transform South Korea from a backward agricultural nation into a modern
   industrial nation that would provide a decent way of life for its
   citizens while at the same time defending itself from outside
   aggression. Lacking the anti-Japanese nationalist credentials of
   [186]Syngman Rhee, for example, Park sought both legitimacy for his
   regime and greater independence for South Korea in a vigorous program
   of economic development that would transform the country from an
   agricultural backwater into a modern industrial nation.

   The Park administration decided that the central government must play
   the key role in economic development because no other South Korean
   institution had the capacity or resources to direct such drastic change
   in a short time. The resulting economic system incorporated elements of
   both [187]state capitalism and [188]free enterprise. The economy was
   dominated by a group of large private conglomerates, known as
   [189]chaebol, and also was supported by a significant number of public
   corporations in such areas as iron and steel, utilities,
   communications, fertilizers, chemicals, and other heavy industries. The
   government guided private industry through a series of export and
   production targets utilizing the control of credit, informal means of
   pressure and persuasion, and traditional monetary and fiscal policies.

   The government hoped to take advantage of existing technology to become
   competitive in areas where other advanced industrial nations had
   already achieved success. Seoul presumed that the well-educated and
   highly motivated work force would produce low-cost, high-quality goods
   that would find ready markets in the United States and the rest of the
   industrial world. Profits generated from the sale of exports would be
   used to further expand capital, provide new jobs, and eventually pay
   off loans.

   In 1961 Park extended government control over business by nationalizing
   the banks and merging the agricultural cooperative movement with the
   agricultural bank. The government's direct control over all
   institutional credit further extended Park's command over the business
   community. The Economic Planning Board was created in 1961 and became
   the nerve center of Park's plan to promote economic development. It was
   headed by a deputy prime minister and staffed by bureaucrats known for
   their high intellectual capability and educational background in
   business and economics. Beginning in the 1960s, the board allocated
   resources, directed the flow of credit, and formulated all of South
   Korea's economic plans. In the late 1980s, the power to allocate
   resources and credit was restored to the functional ministries. In
   1990, the Economic Planning Board was given primary charge of economic
   planning; it also coordinated and often directed the economic functions
   of other government ministries, including the Ministry of Finance. The
   board was complemented by the Korea Development Institute, an
   independent economic research organization funded by the government.
   Other government bodies directing the economy included the Office of
   the President, which included a senior secretary for economic affairs;
   the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Trade and Industry; the
   Ministry of Labor; and the Bank of Korea, which was controlled by the
   Ministry of Finance.
   South Korea is the world's fourth largest [190]oil refiner and a world
   leader in [191]petrochemicals.^[192][11]

   Park's first major goal, which was immediately successful, was to
   establish a self-reliant industrial economy independent of the massive
   waves of United States aid that had kept South Korea afloat during the
   Rhee years. Modernizing the economy and maintaining overall sustained
   growth were additional goals in the 1970s. Significant economic
   policies included strengthening key industries, increasing employment,
   and developing more effective management systems. Because South Korea
   was dependent on imports of raw materials, such as oil, a major
   government objective was to significantly increase the level of
   exports, which meant stressing greater international competitiveness
   and higher productivity. The early economic plans emphasized
   agriculture and infrastructure, the latter were closely tied to
   construction. Later, the emphasis shifted consecutively to light
   industry, electronics, and heavy and chemical industries. Using these
   strategies, an export-driven economy developed.

   The government combined a policy of import substitution with the
   export-led approach. Policy planners selected a group of strategic
   industries to back, including electronics, shipbuilding, and
   automobiles. New industries were nurtured by making the importation of
   such goods difficult. When the new industry was on its feet, the
   government worked to create good conditions for its export. Incentives
   for exports included a reduction of corporate and private income taxes
   for exporters, tariff exemptions for raw materials imported for export
   production, business tax exemptions, and accelerated depreciation
   allowances.

   The export-led program took off in the 1960s; during the 1970s, some
   estimates indicate, Seoul had the world's most productive economy. The
   annual industrial production growth rate was about 25 percent; there
   was a fivefold increase in the GNP from 1965 to 1978. In the mid-1970s,
   exports increased by an average of 45 percent a year.

[[193]edit] Industrial policies

   The major issue facing the Park regime in the early 1960s was the
   grinding poverty of the nation and the need for economic policies to
   overcome this poverty. A critical problem was raising funds to foster
   needed industrial development. Domestic savings were very low, and
   there was little available domestic capital. This obstacle was overcome
   by introducing foreign loans and inaugurating attractive domestic
   interest rates that enticed local capital into production. Of South
   Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, only South Korea financed its
   economic development with a dramatic build-up of foreign debt, debt
   that totaled US$46.8 billion in 1985, making it the fourth largest
   [194]Third World debtor.

   As noted by consultant David I. Steinberg, Seoul administered a series
   of economic development plans. The government mobilized domestic
   capital by encouraging savings, determined what kinds of plants could
   be constructed with these funds, and reviewed the potential of the
   products for export. In this sense, the will of the government to
   undertake economic development played a crucial role; the role of the
   government, however, was not limited to such measures as mobilizing
   capital and allocating investments.

   Steinberg also pointed out that Park's government restructured
   industries, such as defense and construction, sometimes to stimulate
   competition and other times to reduce or eliminate it. The Economic
   Planning Board established export targets that, if met, yielded
   additional government-subsidized credit and further access to the
   growing domestic market. Failure to meet such targets led to Seoul's
   withdrawal of credit.

[[195]edit] Revenues and expenditures

   The central government budget has generally expanded, both in real
   terms and as a proportion of real GNP, since the end of the Korean War,
   stabilizing at between 20 and 21 percent of GNP during most of the
   1980s. [196]Government spending in South Korea has been less than that
   for most countries in the world (excepting the other rapidly growing
   Asian economies of Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore). The share of
   government spending devoted to investment and other capital formation
   activities increased steadily through the periods of the first and
   second five-year plans (1962-1971), peaking at more than 41 percent of
   the budget in 1969. Since 1971 investment expenditures have remained at
   less than 30 percent of the budget, while the share of the budget
   occupied by direct government consumption and transfer payments has
   continued to increase, averaging more than 70 percent during the 1980s.

   During the 1980s, the largest areas of government expenditure were
   economic services (including infrastructural projects and research and
   development), national defense, and education. Economic expenditures
   averaged several percentage points higher than defense expenditures,
   which remained stable at about 22 to 23 percent of the budget (about 6
   percent of GNP) during the decade. In 1990, the government was studying
   plans to lower defense expenditures to 5 percent of GNP. Some observers
   noted a trend toward a slight increase in the portion of the budget
   devoted to social spending during the 1980s. In 1987 expenditures for
   social services--including health, housing, and welfare--were 16.4
   percent of the budget, up from 13.9 percent in 1980, and slightly
   higher than 1987 government outlays for education (see table 3,
   Appendix).

   The government revenue structure was virtually totally dependent on
   taxes (see table 4, Appendix). By the early 1980s, nearly two-thirds of
   tax money was collected in the form of indirect taxes. Revenues
   collected by the central government in 1987 rose to 19,270.3 billion
   won (for value of the won--see Glossary), up from 13.197.5 billion won
   in 1984.

   During the 1960s, public enterprises were concentrated in such areas as
   [197]electrification, banking, communications, and manufacturing. In
   1990 these enterprises were, in many cases, efficient revenue-producing
   concerns that produced essential goods and services at low costs, but
   which also produced profits that were used for new capital investments
   or to produce funds for public use elsewhere. In the 1980s, Seoul was
   slowly privatizing a number of these firms by selling stocks, but the
   government remained the principal stockholder in each company. In the
   1980s, an important function of public enterprises was the introduction
   of new and expensive technology ventures.

   In 1985 the public enterprise sector consisted of about 90 enterprises
   employing 305,000 workers, or 2.7 percent of total employment in the
   nonagricultural sector. There were four categories of public
   enterprises: government enterprises (staffed and run by government
   officials), government-invested enterprises (with at least 50 percent
   government ownership), subsidiaries of government-invested enterprises
   (usually having indirect government funding), and other
   government-backed enterprises. Government-invested public enterprises,
   such as the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and the Pohang
   Iron and Steel Company (POSCO), represented the core of the new
   enterprises established during Park's regime. In the late 1980s,
   roughly 30 percent of the revenues produced by public enterprises came
   from the manufacturing sector and the other 70 percent from such
   service sectors as the electrical, communications, and [198]financial
   industries.

[[199]edit] Financing

   [200]Seoul is consistently placed among the world's top ten
   [201]financial and [202]commercial cities.^[203][2]

   Financing South Korea's economic development in the 1990s was expected
   to differ from previous decades in two main respects: greater reliance
   on domestic sources and more emphasis on equity relative to debt.
   Beginning in the 1960s, foreign credit was used to finance development,
   but the amount of foreign debt had decreased since the mid-1980s.
   According to the Sixth Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan
   (1987-91), an average annual growth rate of 8 percent was expected,
   together with account surpluses of about US$5 billion a year through
   1991.

   To realize these growth targets, South Koreans needed the gross
   domestic savings rate to exceed the domestic investment rate;
   additionally, they needed the financing of future economic growth to
   come entirely from domestic sources. Such a situation would involve
   reducing foreign debt by US$2 billion a year; and South Korea would
   become a net creditor nation in the mid-1990s. Through the promotion
   and reform of the securities markets, especially the stock market, and
   increased foreign investment, the sixth plan encouraged the
   diversification of sources and types of corporate finance, especially
   equity finance.

   Domestic savings were very low before the mid-1960s, equivalent to less
   than 2 percent of GNP in the 1960 to 1962 period. The savings rate
   jumped to 10 percent between 1970 and 1972 when banks began offering
   depositors rates of 20 percent or more on savings accounts. This
   situation allowed banks to compete effectively for deposits with
   unorganized money markets that had previously offered higher rates than
   the banks. The savings rate increased to 16.8 percent of GNP in 1975
   and 28 percent in 1979, but temporarily plunged to 20.8 percent in 1980
   because of the oil price rise. After 1980, as incomes rose, so did the
   savings rate. The surge of the savings rate to 36.3 percent in 1987 and
   35.8 percent in 1989 reflected the sharp growth of GNP in the 1980s.
   The prospects for continued high rates of saving were associated with
   continued high GNP growth, which nevertheless declined to 6.5 percent
   in 1989.

   According to Donald S. Macdonald, through the early 1980s funds for
   investment came primarily from bilateral government loans (mainly from
   the United States and Japan), international lending organizations, and
   commercial banks. In the late 1980s, however, domestic savings
   accounted for two-thirds or more of total investment.

   Throughout the 1980s, the financial sector underwent significant
   expansion, diversification of products and services, and structural
   changes brought about by economic liberalization policies. As noted by
   Park Yung-chul, financial liberalization eased interest ceilings.
   Deregulation increased competition in financial markets, which in turn
   accelerated product diversification. In the early 1980s, securities
   companies were permitted to sell securities through a [204]repurchase
   agreement. By 1985 banks also were allowed to engage in the repurchase
   agreements of government and public bonds. In 1981 finance and
   investment corporations started dealing in large-denomination
   commercial paper. The new form of commercial paper was issued in
   minimum denominations of 10 million won, compared to the previous
   minimum value for commercial paper of 1 million won.

   In order to extend their ability to raise cash, investment and finance
   companies introduced a new cash-management account with a 4 million won
   minimum deposit in 1983. Investment and finance corporations managed
   client funds by investing them in commercial paper corporate bonds and
   certificates of deposit. Money-deposit banks in the mid-1980s began
   offering similar accounts, known as household money-in-trust. Trust
   business formerly had been the exclusive domain of the Bank of Seoul
   and Trust Company; however, after 1983 all money-deposit banks were
   authorized to offer trust services. The finance|financial system
   underwent two major structural changes in the late 1970s and 1980s.
   First, money-deposit banks saw a sustained erosion of their
   once-dominant market position (from 80 percent in the 1970 to 1974
   period to 55 percent by 1984). One reason for this decline was that in
   the 1970s nonbank finance|financial intermediaries, such as investment
   trust corporations, finance companies, and merchant banking
   corporations, were given preferential treatment. Further, because the
   costs of intermediation at these nonbank finance|financial institutions
   were lower than at banks (with their many branches nationwide and their
   multitudes of small savers and borrowers), their cost advantages and
   higher lending rates allowed them a larger market share.

   The second structural change was the rapid increase of commercial paper
   and corporate debenture markets. Another development was the steady
   growth of investment trust corporations in the 1980s.

   Because of the introduction of tax and financing incentives by the
   government that encouraged companies to list their shares on the stock
   market, the Korean Stock Exchange grew rapidly in the late 1980s. In
   1987 more than 350 companies were listed on the exchange. There was an
   average daily trading volume of 10 million shares, with a turnover
   ratio of 80 percent. In 1989 the stock market was tarnished by
   accusations of insider trading among the five major South Korean
   securities firms. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an
   investigation in late 1989. The popular index of the market soared to a
   high of 1,007.77 points on April 1, 1989, but plunged back to the 800s
   in late 1989 and early 1990.

   Business financing was obtained primarily through bank loans or
   borrowing on the informal and high-interest "curb market" of private
   lenders. The curb market served individuals who needed cash urgently,
   less reputable businesspeople who engaged in speculation, and the
   multitudes of smaller companies that needed operating funds but could
   not procure bank financing. The loans they received, often in exchange
   for weak collateral, had very high interest rates. The curb market
   played a critical role in the 1960s and 1970s in pumping money into the
   economy and in assisting the growth of smaller corporations. The curb
   market continued to exist, along with the formal banking system,
   through the 1980s.

[[205]edit] Industry

   [206]Samsung Group is the world's largest [207]conglomerate,^[208][12]
   leading several key [209]industries in the world.
   South Korea is the world's leading producer of computer [210]memory
   chips.^[211][13]

   The growth of the industrial sector was the principal stimulus to
   economic development. In 1987 manufacturing industries accounted for
   approximately 30 percent of the gross domestic product and 25 percent
   of the work force. Benefiting from strong domestic encouragement and
   foreign aid, Seoul's industrialists introduced modern technologies into
   outmoded or newly built facilities at a rapid pace, increased the
   production of commodities--especially those for sale in foreign
   markets--and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial
   expansion. As a result, industry altered the country's landscape,
   drawing millions of laborers to urban manufacturing centers.

   A downturn in the South Korean economy in 1989 spurred by a sharp
   decrease in exports and foreign orders caused deep concern in the
   industrial sector. Ministry of Trade and [212]Industry analysts stated
   that poor export performance resulted from structural problems embedded
   in the nation's economy, including an overly strong won, increased
   wages and high labor costs, frequent strikes, and high interest rates.
   The result was an increase in inventories and severe cutbacks in
   production at a number of electronics, automobile, and textile
   manufacturers, as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts.
   Factory [213]automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on
   labor, to boost productivity with a much smaller work force, and to
   improve competitiveness. It was estimated that over two-thirds of South
   Korea's manufacturers spent over half of the funds available for
   facility investments on automation.

   In 1990 South Korean manufacturers planned a significant shift in
   future production plans toward high-technology industries. In June
   1989, panels of government officials, scholars, and business leaders
   held planning sessions on the production of such goods as new
   materials, mechatronics-- including industrial robotics--
   bioengineering, microelectronics, fine chemistry, and aerospace. This
   shift in emphasis, however, did not mean an immediate decline in heavy
   industries such as automobile and ship production, which had dominated
   the economy in the 1980s.

   Except for mining, most industries were located in the urban areas of
   the northwest and southeast. Heavy industries generally were located in
   the south of the country. Factories in Seoul contributed over 25
   percent of all manufacturing value-added in 1978; taken together with
   factories in surrounding Kyonggi Province, factories in the Seoul area
   produced 46 percent of all manufacturing that year. Factories in Seoul
   and Kyonggi Province employed 48 percent of the nation's 2.1 million
   factory workers.

[[214]edit] Energy

          Main article: [215]Energy in South Korea

   With few native energy resources, South Korea has used nuclear combined
   with conventional thermal power plants to keep up with aggressive
   economic growth.

   The Korean Peninsula is only modestly endowed with natural resources,
   and North Korea has far more natural resources than South Korea. During
   the Japanese colonial period (1910-45), the North served as the center
   for mining and industry whereas the South, with somewhat greater
   rainfall, a warmer climate, and slightly greater arable terrain, served
   as the center for rice production.

[[216]edit] Agriculture

   A major land reform in the late 1940s and early 1950s spread ownership
   of land to the rural peasantry. Individual holdings, however, were too
   small (averaging one [217]hectare, which made cultivation inefficient
   and discouraged mechanization) or too spread out to provide families
   with much chance to produce a significant quantity of food.
   Additionally, South Korea is a mountainous country with only 22 percent
   [218]arable land and less rainfall than most other neighboring
   rice-growing countries.

   At the start of the economic boom in 1963, the majority of South
   Koreans were farmers. Sixty-three percent of the population lived in
   rural areas. In the next twenty-five years, South Korea grew from a
   predominantly rural, agricultural nation into an urban, [219]newly
   industrialized country and the agricultural workforce shrunk to only 21
   percent in 1989. Government officials expected that urbanization and
   industrialization would further reduce the number of agricultural
   workers to well under 20 percent by 2000.

   The enormous growth of urban areas led to a rapid decrease of available
   farmland, while at the same time population increases and bigger
   incomes meant that the demand for food greatly outstripped supply. The
   result of these developments was that by the late 1980s roughly half of
   South Korea's needs, mainly [220]wheat and [221]animal feed [222]corn,
   was imported.

   Compared with the industrial and service sectors, agriculture remained
   the most sluggish sector of the economy. In 1988 the contribution of
   agriculture to overall [223]GDP was only about 10.8 percent, down from
   approximately 12.3 percent the previous year. Most economists agreed
   that the country's rural areas had gained more than they had
   contributed in the course of industrialization. Still, the growth of
   agricultural output, which averaged 3.4 percent per year between 1945
   and 1974, 6.8 percent annually during the 1974-79 period, and 5.6
   percent between 1980 and 1986, was credible. The gains were even more
   impressive because they added to a traditionally high level of
   productivity. On the other hand, the overall growth of the agriculture,
   [224]forestry, and [225]fishing sector was only 0.6 percent in 1987 as
   compared with the manufacturing sector, which grew 16 percent during
   1986 and 1987.

[[226]edit] Service industries

   The [227]Central Business District of [228]Seoul.

   Service industries included [229]insurance, [230]restaurants,
   [231]hotels, [232]laundries, [233]public bath houses, health-related
   services, and entertainment establishments. There were thousands of
   small shops marketing specialized items, large traditional
   marketplaces, and streamlined buildings housing corporate and
   professional offices. Game rooms featuring Ping-Pong tables, or
   billiards, and tearooms serving a variety of beverages were located on
   almost every downtown city corner.

   In the mid-1980s, the largest employer of South Korea's service sector
   was retail trade. A growing number of workers were employed by the
   department stores (most of which were owned by [234]chaebol) that were
   opening rapidly in the downtown areas of major urban centers. The vast
   majority of retailers were small merchants in cities, towns, and
   villages, each with a modest storefront, or stand, limited stock, and
   poor access to capital, but the great majority of South Koreans made
   their purchases from these small retailers. In 1986 there were
   approximately 26,054 wholesale and 542,548 retail establishments and
   233,834 hotels and restaurants that employed about 1.7 million people
   (these figures probably do not include family members working in small
   stores).^[[235]citation needed]

   The distribution system was far from perfect, and managers recognized
   the need for better organization and management. Most of the nation's
   wholesalers were located in Seoul and accounted for most of the
   turnover of goods. Most of the sales outlets were located in the heart
   of urban centers. Cargo truck terminals and warehouse facilities were
   spread irregularly through city neighborhoods.

   An improved transportation and communications infrastructure,
   increasing incomes, enhanced consumer sophistication, and government
   tax incentives encouraged the development of a modern distribution
   network of chain stores, supermarkets, and department stores.

   South Korea's hosting the [238]1988 Seoul Olympics made 1988 a boom
   year for tourism. More than 2 million tourists spent US$3.3 billion, an
   increase in the number of tourists and the dollars spent, respectively,
   of 24.9 percent and 42.2 percent over 1987. Japanese visitors accounted
   for 48 percent of the total; tourists from the United States made up
   14.9 percent. This trend continued in subsequent years, with 2.95
   million foreign visitors arriving in 1990 and 3.8 million in
   1995.^[239][14]

[[240]edit] Labour force

[[241]edit] Labour movement in the 1980s

   Despite significant increases in wages in the 1980s, [242]labour unions
   in the late 1980s continued their wave of strikes demanding better
   working conditions and wages. The ferocity and sheer size of the labour
   movement caught management and the government by surprise. During his
   first year or so in office, President [243]Roh Tae Woo was confronted
   with considerable labour unrest; there were more than 300 strikes in
   the first three months of 1989. Emboldened by the political reforms of
   1987 and by reports that the rate of South Korea's economic growth was
   greater than the improvements in their own incomes and life-styles,
   many workers agitated for a greater share of the nation's prosperity
   and sought more freedom and responsibility at the workplace and an end
   to the traditional paternalism of management. Lost production was
   estimated to have climbed to US$6 billion in 1989 from US$4.4 billion
   in 1988.

   Workers were caught in a revolution of rising expectations, as a wave
   of rising urban land values and housing costs outpaced average real
   wage increases of more than 70 percent during the 1980s. Moreover,
   wages for manual workers, who were responsible for much of the
   production and export that fueled the economy, were much lower than the
   national average. In the late 1980s, working families still found
   themselves struggling to meet minimum standards of living. Employees
   also were expected to work long and often erratic hours in exchange for
   steady employment and were frustrated over a lack of benefits and
   individual say.

   Worker complaints were focused on three areas: low wages, long working
   hours, and a high number of industrial accidents. In 1986 the average
   wage of a South Korean worker was US$381 a month (339,474 won),
   including overtime and all allowances. The basic wage was US$287, or
   255,408 won, but, according to the government, the basic wage necessary
   to sustain a "decent" way of life was US$588 (524,113 won). Thus, the
   average worker only earned two-thirds of what the government thought
   necessary to sustain a family of four. In 1987 semiskilled workers
   typically received US$1.50 to US$2.00 per hour and worked fifty-five to
   sixty hours a week; unskilled workers worked twelve-hour days seven
   days a week, earning US$125 a month.

[[244]edit] Recent trends

   South Korea was known for having the world's longest working hours. In
   1986 the Korean worker averaged about 54.7 hours a week. This situation
   was the natural consequence of the low wage system that necessitated
   extended hours and extra work to earn minimum living expenses.

   There were, however, dramatic increases in wages in 1988 and 1989.
   [245]Labour stoppages in the manufacturing sector, coupled with a
   scarcity of labour, led to 20-percent salary increases for workers in
   the manufacturing sector in 1988 and 25-percent salary increases in
   that sector in 1989. These raises later spread, increasing wages across
   the entire economy 18.7 percent in 1989. By 1989 some South Korean
   economists were worrying about the effect that skyrocketing wages would
   have on the cost of domestic-made goods and the consequent impact on
   export prices. The situation was especially worrisome because the wages
   paid to workers in South Korea's major competitors were growing far
   more slowly.

   Average annual household income is 39,013,596 won (USD 42,108) as of 1Q
   2007 retrieved from Korea National Statistical office.

[[246]edit] Science and technology

          See also: [247]Science and technology in Korea

   The most important sources of productive growth for South Korean
   manufacturers had traditionally been directly or indirectly related to
   the ability of South Korean companies to acquire new technology from
   abroad and to adapt it to domestic conditions, rather than paying the
   cost of research and development. However, as Seoul's industry and
   exports continued to evolve toward higher levels of technology,
   domestic research and development efforts needed to be increased.
   Fortunately for South Korea, its high level of well-educated workers,
   who constitute a formidable brain trust for future research and
   development, are its major asset.

[[248]edit] Historical development

   The Seoul government began investing in technology research institutes
   soon after the republic was established. The [249]Korean Atomic Energy
   Commission founded in 1959 was responsible for research and
   development, production, dissemination, and management of technology
   for peaceful applications of atomic energy. In the mid-1960s, the
   government established the [250]Ministry of Science and Technology to
   oversee all government research and development activities and the
   [251]Korea Institute of Science and Technology to function as an
   industrial research laboratory.

   In the 1970s, in order to better coordinate research and development,
   two scientific communities were established--one in Seoul, the other
   near [252]Taejon. The Seoul complex included the Korea Institute of
   Science and Technology, the [253]Korea Development Institute
   (affiliated with the [254]Economic Planning Board), the [255]Korea
   Advanced Institute of Science, and the [256]Korea Atomic Energy
   Research Institute. Plans for the [257]Daeduk Science Town near Taejon
   were far more ambitious. Modeled after the [258]Tsukuba Science City in
   [259]Japan, by the late 1980s the Daeduk Science Town accommodated
   laboratories specializing in shipbuilding, nuclear fuel processing,
   metrology, chemistry, and energy research. The government founded the
   [260]Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology to develop and
   offer graduate science programs, and it also encouraged universities to
   develop their own undergraduate programs in science.

[[261]edit] High technology

   South Korea is a world leader in [262]high-tech electronics such as
   [263]cell phones and [264]LCD TVs, led by [265]Samsung and [266]LG.

   The tremendous growth of [267]Samsung since the mid-1980s was strong
   evidence of the high productivity in such modern industries as
   electronics. The group's total sales nearly doubled (8.4 billion won to
   14.6 billion won) between 1984 and 1986, while the number of employees
   only increased from 122,000 to 147,000. The reason for this high degree
   of productivity was South Korea's move away from labor-intensive
   industries to those that were highly automated.

   South Korean planners realized that the country needed to advance
   quickly in such areas as high technology if the economy were to grow
   while matching foreign competition. [268]POSCO's decisions to build the
   [269]Pohang Institute of Science and Technology and the [270]Research
   Institute of Industrial Science and Technology were examples of this
   trend. POSCO also used a great deal of money to lure back more than 100
   top South Korean scientists and researchers who had emigrated abroad.

   POSCO's efforts represented a great change from the past. As of the
   late 1980s, many of South Korea's younger scientists, technocrats, and
   economic planners had received their graduate education in the United
   States. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the government sponsored the
   scientific and technical education of many graduate students at
   prestigious institutions, such as [271]Harvard University and the
   [272]Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The success of the Pohang
   Institute of Science and Technology meant that many of South Korea's
   future scientific and technical leaders would be educated at home.

   In 1987 the [273]Korea Development Institute issued a report,
   [274]Korea Year 2000, that profiled South Korean economic development
   in 2000. The Korea Development Institute noted that the industrial
   structure would be highly developed and would resemble that of advanced
   countries inasmuch as high value-added industries, high-technology
   industries, and soft industries grew relatively rapidly. Further,
   changes in industrial structure were expected rapidly to reduce the
   demand for unskilled workers while simultaneously increasing the demand
   for professional and technical manpower, resulting in further change of
   the employment structure.

   The Korea Development Institute also noted that the Ministry of Science
   and Technology had prepared a long-range plan of science and technology
   for the twenty-first century that took into account limited available
   resources. Accordingly, Seoul selected its comparative advantage areas,
   including [275]informatics-- particularly information storage and
   retrieval and electronic data processing, [276]fine chemicals, and
   [277]precision machinery in the short term; [278]biotechnology and
   [279]new materials in the mid-term; public benefit areas, such as the
   environment, health, and welfare, as another group; and
   [280]oceanography and [281]aeronautics for the medium and long term.

   In 1990 Seoul announced an ambitious plan to promote science and
   technology so that high-technology activities would dominate the
   economy by the year 2000. The Ministry of Science and Technology
   intended to coordinate technology-related projects between government
   and industry in a variety of fields including semiconductors,
   computers, chemistry, and new materials.

   The R&D Budget set for 2008 is USD 11.15 billion according to the
   Ministry of Science and Technology. [282][7]

[[283]edit] North-South trade

   Since 1988, two-way trade between the two Korean countries has
   increased from $18.8 million in 1989 to $647.1 million in 2002. In
   2002, South Korea imported $271.57 million worth of goods from
   [284]North Korea, mostly agro-fisheries and metal products, while
   shipping $371.55 million worth of goods, mostly [285]humanitarian aid
   commodities including fertilizer and textiles as inputs for North
   Korean garment manufacturers. South Korea is now North Korea's
   third-largest trading partner, after China and Japan. Numerous ventures
   by the [286]Hyundai Group have contributed to North Korea's economy,
   including the [287]Kmgang-san (Diamond Mountain) tourist site. Last
   year alone, 84,347 visitors travelled by Hyundai-operated passenger
   ships, and most recently via land routes, as part of this tourism
   initiative, raising the total number of South Korean visitors to over
   half a million (see [288]Kmgang-san Tourist Region). A mere 1,141 North
   Koreans travelled to South Korea, mainly for joint sporting events.
   [289]Hyundai Asan is also lined up to be the South Korean party that
   will help develop an 800 acre (3.2 km) industrial complex in
   [290]Kaesng, located near the [291]Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), subject to
   final agreements, including between [292]Seoul and [293]P'yngyang. The
   year 2002 witnessed significant progress on the Seoul-[294]Shiniju
   railroad, on both reconstructing road and rail links across the DMZ (as
   of early 2004 this process was stalled). However, the constructiveness
   of these efforts is still on question, as North Korea still declines to
   abandon its radical [295]neo-Stalinist style of government and is
   hardly showing any reliable economic growth.

   The annual output of a South Korean-built industrial complex in North
   Koreas border city of Gaeseong reached 185 million U.S. dollars in
   2007. [296][8] Inter-Korean trade volume in 2007 totaled 1.79 billion
   dollars. [297][9]

[[298]edit] Macro-economic trend

   This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of South Korea at
   market prices [299]estimated by the International Monetary Fund with
   figures in millions of South Korean Won.
   Year Gross Domestic Product US Dollar Exchange Inflation Index
   (2000=100)
   1980 38,774,900 605.85 Won 33
   1985 84,061,000 869.51 Won 46
   1990 186,690,900 707.59 Won 60
   1995 398,837,700 771.27 Won 82

   2005 812,196,561 1,024.11 Won 117

   For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar is exchanged at
   841.39 Won only. This implies that for 2006, with exchange rates of 945
   per dollar, and nominal GDP over 850 trillion won, the GDP will reach
   over $900 Billion (US dollars).
