[[17]edit] Municipal politics

   Massey first ran for public office in the [18]1974 Edmonton municipal
   election. He ran for the office of Public School Trustee finishing a
   eighth place with 23,471 votes. He was just 100 votes short from
   earning the seventh place seat that went to [19]Mel Binder. He ran
   again for School Trustee in the [20]1977 Edmonton municipal election,
   this time there were two seats added. Massey won the fifth place seat
   with 33,444 votes.

   Massey would run as an incumbent in the [21]1980 Edmonton municipal
   election. He would see a significant drop in his popular vote, but
   would finish fourth place out of the top nine with 19,060 votes. Massey
   would significantly increase his popular vote winning 50,007 votes and
   second place out of nine in the [22]1983 Edmonton municipal election.
   He won his fifth and final term in the [23]1986 Edmonton municipal
   election. Once again he took second place and won with 29,323. He did
   not run again in 1989.

[[24]edit] Provincial politics

   After serving for eleven years as a Public School Trustee, Massey
   decided to run for provincial office in the [25]1993 Alberta general
   election. He won the electoral district of [26]Edmonton Mill Woods
   picking it up for the [27]Liberals. He defeated five other candidates
   with a comfortable plurality to win his first term in office. He was
   re-elected to his second term in the [28]1997 Alberta general election.
   He was reelected with a reduced but comfortable margin of victory and
   popular vote share defeating four other candidates.^[29][1]

   Massey stood for a third term in the [30]2001 Alberta general election
   defeating Progressive Conservative candidate [31]Carl Benito in a hotly
   contested election.^[32][2] He would become the interim [33]Liberal
   leader and Official Opposition Leader after [34]Ken Nicol resigned to
   run for a seat in the [35]Canadian House of Commons in 2004.
