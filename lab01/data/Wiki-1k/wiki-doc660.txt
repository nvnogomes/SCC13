   e-participation (also written eParticipation and e-Participation) is a
   recently invented term meaning ICT-supported participation in processes
   involved in government and governance. Processes may concern
   administration, service delivery, decision making and policy making.
   eParticipation is hence closely related to [12]e-government and
   (e-)[13]governance. (ICT=Information and Communication Technologies).
   The need for the term has emerged as user benefits and values have
   often been paid less attention to in the e-government development than
   those of the service providers.

   A more detailed definition sees eParticipation as "the use of
   information and communication technologies to broaden and deepen
   political participation by enabling citizens to connect with one
   another and with their elected representatives" [1]. This definition
   includes all stakeholders in democratic decision-making processes and
   not only citizen related top-down government initiatives. So
   eParticipation can be seen as part of [14]eDemocracy, whereas
   eDemocracy means the use of ICT by governments in general used by
   elected officials, media, political parties and interest groups, civil
   society organizations, international governmental organizations, or
   citizens/voters within any of the political processes of
   states/regions, nations, and local and global communities [2]. The
   complexity of eParticipation processes results from the large number of
   different participation areas, involved stakeholders, levels of
   engagement, and stages in policy making, which characterize the
   research and applications [3, chapter 2].

[[21]edit] European eParticipation Preparatory Action

   eParticipation is the Preparatory Action ^[22][1] lasts for three years
   (2006-2008). The EU is taking the lead in using on-line tools to
   improve the legislative process for its citizens. eParticipation which
   launched on 1 January 2007 will run as a series of linked projects
   which each contribute to a greater awareness and involvement by
   citizens in the legislation process right from the initial drafting
   through to its implementation at a regional and local level.

   The individual projects will concentrate on ensuring that the
   legislative language and process is more transparent, understandable
   and accessible to the citizen. In addition the projects emphasis on the
   communication of legislation will be used to enhance and grow citizens
   involvement and contribution in the process of creating and thereafter
   implementing the legislation.

   So far, 14 projects have been funded ^[23][2]. In the first year six
   trial projects were selected and in 2007 a further seven trial projects
   as well as a support action to coordinate and promote the
   eParticipation projects were chosen. The [24]European Parliament,
   national parliaments and local and regional authorities are actively
   involved. State-of-the-art ICT tools are being tested to facilitate the
   writing of legal texts, including translation into different languages,
   and the drafting of amendments as well as making the texts easier for
   non-specialists to find and understand. New digital technologies are
   also being used to give citizens easier access to information and the
   more opportunity to try to influence decisions that affect their lives.

[[25]edit] History

   The term emanated in the early 2000s and draws generally on three
   developments.
    1. The general development in [26]CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative
       Work) and [27]groupware directed towards collaborative environments
       to support human ICT-mediated interaction, both work-related and
       social.
    2. The development in [28]E-democracy since the late 1990s, where
       interest rapidly evolved from e-voting to several forms of
       ICT-supported and enabled interaction between governments and
       citizens, including not only direct ones such as consultations,
       lobbying, petitioning and polling but also ones pursued outside of
       government itself, including electioneering, campaigning, and
       community informatics.
    3. The development in [29]e-government towards increasingly complex
       service delivery. Complex services require considerable interaction
       including searching, selecting options based on multiple criteria,
       calculating outcomes, notifications, inquiries, complaints, and
       many other activities. There are several ICT tools for such tasks,
       ranging from FAQs to call centres, but there is a need to
       coordinate all these into user-friendly but powerful toolsets for
       client-organization encounters. Because interaction in such
       contexts is complex, and because goals have to be reached, the
       arenas where it takes places becomes social arenas for
       ICT-supported participation.

[[30]edit] On the definition

   The term [31]Participation means taking part in joint activities for
   the purpose of reaching a common goal. This encompasses both trivial
   situations in which participation mainly has a technical meaning, doing
   things together. For example, a football team needs 11 players, and
   dancing often requires two or more people acting in a coordinated
   manner. But participation, even in trivial situations, also has a
   goal-oriented aspect which means decision making and control are
   involved. Participation in political science and theory of management
   refers to direct public participation in political, economical or
   management decisions. The two are not completely separated but belong
   on a spectrum of complexity and context. When participation becomes
   complicated, decision making becomes necessary. Hence, any
   participatory process is potentially important for the rule system
   governing the activities. In terms of points 2 and 3 above, this means
   that when service processes become complex, the implementation of them
   will not be in all details based on political decisions but also on
   what is found to be practical. Such decisions are made in many places
   in a situated manner. When such practical doings become implemented in
   government (e)service systems, they will affect decision making, as
   many changes will later be hard to make simply because exising
   procedures are implemented in ICT systems and government agencies
   procedures. There are many theories dealing with institutionalization,
   for example [32]Structuration theory, [33]Institutional theory, and
   [34]Actor-Network Theory. These theories all, in different ways, deal
   with how "ways of doing things" become established or rejected, and how
   those that become established increasingly affect the ways we
   "normally" do things.
