[[46]edit] Geography

   The [47]Capilano River.
   Capilano Lake.

   The District of North Vancouver is separated from [48]Vancouver by
   [49]Burrard Inlet. It can be accessed by the [50]Lions' Gate Bridge,
   the [51]Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing, and the
   [52]SeaBus passenger ferry.

   The District is bounded by the [53]Capilano River to the west, Indian
   Arm to the east, [54]Burrard Inlet to the south, and the [55]Coast
   Mountains to the north. It sprawls in an east-west direction across the
   mountain slopes, and is characterized by rugged terrain and steep and
   winding roadways. While there is no true urban core within the
   District, there are a number of separate commercial neighbourhood
   centres. These include (from west to east): [56]Edgemont Village, Upper
   Lonsdale, [57]Lynn Valley, Main Street, Parkgate, and [58]Deep Cove.

   The District has a lot in common with [59]West Vancouver and the
   [60]City of North Vancouver. Together these three municipalities are
   commonly referred to as the [61]North Shore. Most of the residents of
   the District live in single family dwellings. Except for a few more
   historical areas, much of the development of the District has occurred
   since the 1950s. The [62]City of North Vancouver has considerably
   higher commercial and residential density. However, the differences
   between the two "North Vans" are most apparent to their respective
   residents. For the most part, other Lower Mainland residents rarely
   distinguish between the District and the City, referring to both
   collectively as "North Vancouver".

[[63]edit] History

   For thousands of years, the [64]Indigenous [65]Swxw7mesh and their kin
   [66]Tsleil-Waututh, of the [67]Coast Salish, resided in the land known
   as North Vancouver. Slightly over 200 years ago, the people of the
   [68]Swxw7mesh and [69]Tsleil-Waututh living on the North Shore had
   their first glimpse of Europeans. First the Spanish arrived, giving
   their name to Vancouvers Spanish Banks and, in 1792, Captain George
   Vancouver explored the local shores. But it was not until 1862 that the
   first attempt was made to harvest the North Shores rich stands of
   timber, leading to fuller settlement of the area that would later
   become North Vancouver.

   The first industry on the North Shore was Pioneer Mills, founded in
   1862 to log the huge trees of the coastal rainforest. After twice
   changing hands, the operation was bought by Sewell ("Sue") Prescott
   Moody in 1865. Near where the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool grain elevators
   now stand, the town of Moodyville grew up and stood as the main centre
   of activity on the North Shore until the mill closed in 1901. The first
   school was established in [70]Moodyville. The second, Central School,
   opened in 1902 in a building that still stands as part of what is now
   Presentation House at 3rd Street and Chesterfield Avenue, the current
   home of the North Vancouver Museum and Archives.

   In 1891, the first municipality on the North Shore was formed as the
   District of North Vancouver. It stretched across the North Shore from
   Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove but omitted Moodyville. In the early years
   of this century, a real estate boom took place, with speculators
   including the British poet [71]Rudyard Kipling eager to turn a quick
   dollar. A new community began to take shape. In 1902, the Hotel North
   Vancouver was built; in 1905, the first bank, a branch of the Bank of
   North America, opened. A newspaper, the Express, commenced publication
   in 1905 and in 1906 the [72]British Columbia Electric Railway began
   streetcar service.

   Industry, particularly shipbuilding, became central, with the
   magnificent stands of trees a rich resource for a society in which
   ships, houses and most other manmade things were constructed mainly of
   wood. The Wallace Shipyards moved in 1906 to the area just east of
   Lonsdale Avenue, drawn by the arrival of electricity. Over the years,
   this company, later known as [73]Burrard Dry Dock and then Versatile
   Pacific Shipyards, became a major force in the local economy. Many of
   the shipyard's buildings still stand although the company has now
   ceased operations.

   Economic prosperity and rapid growth in the Lower Lonsdale area of
   North Vancouver led to the establishment in 1907 of the separate City
   of North Vancouver, with a population of approximately 1,500. West
   Vancouver separated from the District in 1912. Apart from the addition
   of Moodyville in 1915, the boundaries of the City have not changed,
   even though far more people now call the District home.

   Communications with Vancouver have always been an important factor in
   the development of the North Shore. The first ferry service was
   supplied by "Navvy Jacks" rowboat in 1866. In 1867, the Sea Foam
   established regular ferry service that continued until 1958. The
   [74]SeaBus re-established water transportation in 1977. Rail service
   was slower in developing. While the Pacific Great Eastern Railway
   inaugurated a 12.7 mile run from North Vancouver to Whytecliff in 1914,
   it was not until the completion of the first [75]Second Narrows Bridge
   in 1925 that rail and road links with the Lower Mainland supplemented
   the local ferry service.

   Early plans for North Vancouver were ambitious. The City as a
   communications hub and industrial centre was surrounded by the more
   rural District, both municipalities in a magnificent geographical
   setting that appeared to open endless possibilities. But early
   grandiose plans met with a number of setbacks. The real estate boom was
   overtaken by a worldwide depression in 1913 and then World War I
   delayed many projects. The depression that began in 1929, coupled with
   disruptions to communications over the Second Narrows caused by ships
   colliding with the bridge, led to economic difficulties and severe tax
   shortfalls. Both the City and the District were placed in receivership
   in 1933. But the opening of the second road crossing, the [76]Lions'
   Gate Bridge in 1938 was a significant factor in making the North Shore
   more accessible. And the war years led to an economic revival of North
   Vancouver, especially because of the many ships built in the Burrard
   Drydock at the foot of Lonsdale for the Canadian war effort.

   In the postwar years, the City and the District of North Vancouver
   boomed, with most of the growth taking place in the District because of
   its greater land resources.

[[85]edit] Industry

   While industry was the engine that propelled North Vancouver for much
   of the twentieth century, this has now largely been replaced by
   enterprises more in tune with present economic realities. Many North
   Shore companies are in the business of creating and marketing high
   technology.

   The television and film industry has made the area the centre of
   Hollywood North. Filming of the popular series The X-Files took place
   in North Vancouver for five seasons, with many of its "wilderness"
   sequences shot in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve (LSCR).

[[86]edit] Sites of interest

   [87]Capilano Suspension Bridge
     * The [88]Capilano Suspension Bridge in a private park carries hikers
       across the Capilano River to nature trails and a unique rain forest
       canopy walk. (admission fee)
     * The [89]Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge is in a district of North
       Vancouver Public Park. (free admission)
     * [90]Grouse Mountain is a ski hill and a tourist destination reached
       by either a [91]gondola lift or the famous Grouse Grind hike.
     * [92]Mount Seymour is a ski and hiking destination in the District.
     * The [93]Cleveland Dam in the [94]Capilano River Regional Park
       offers nature trails as well as a fish [95]hatchery exhibit.

[[96]edit] Transportation

   The main (and only) highway through the District of North Vancouver is
   the [97]Trans-Canada Highway ([98]Highway 1). This crosses over the
   [99]Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing from Vancouver and
   goes through the District to the western border with West Vancouver.

   Public transit, operated by [100]Coast Mountain Bus Company and funded
   by [101]TransLink, runs routes throughout the District, mostly from
   [102]Lonsdale Quay in the City of North Vancouver. [103]West Vancouver
   Blue Bus also runs several routes between the two North Vancouvers and
   West Vancouver.

[[104]edit] Demographics

   According to the 2006 Census:
     * Population: 82,562
     * Growth Rate (2001-2006): 0.3 %
     * Total Private Dwellings: 30,957
     * Land Area: 160.67 km.
     * Density: 513.9 people per km.
