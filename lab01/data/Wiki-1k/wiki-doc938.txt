   [23]Field Marshal Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby
   [24]GCB, [25]GCMG, [26]GCVO (23 April 1861 14 May 1936) was a
   [27]British soldier and administrator most famous for his role during
   [28]World War I, in which he led the [29]Egyptian Expeditionary Force
   in the conquest of [30]Palestine and [31]Syria in 1917 and 1918.

   Allenby, nicknamed the "Bloody Bull", is generally considered to have
   been a [32]martinet who tyrannically ruled over the men serving under
   him. However, [33]Archibald Wavell, a British field marshal during
   World War II who had served under Allenby, defends him as being an
   intelligent and caring man, if a professional consummate soldier.
   [34]T. E. Lawrence ("of Arabia"), whose efforts with the [35]Arab
   Revolt were greatly aided by Allenby, thought similarly of him: "(He
   was) physically large and confident, and morally so great that the
   comprehension of our littleness came slow to him".^[36][1] Allenby was
   arguably one of the most successful British commanders of the war,
   utilizing strategies he developed from his experiences in the [37]Boer
   War and on the [38]Western Front towards his [39]Palestinian Campaigns
   of 1917-8. His management of the [40]Battle of Megiddo in particular,
   with its brilliant use of [41]infantry and mobile [42]cavalry, is
   considered by many to be a precursor to the [43]Blitzkrieg tactics so
   widely employed during [44]World War II.

[[61]edit] Early years and active service

   Born in [62]Brackenhurst, [63]Nottinghamshire, Allenby was educated at
   [64]Haileybury College. He had no great desire to be a soldier, and
   tried to enter the [65]Indian Civil Service, failing the entry exam
   twice. In 1880, he sat the exam for the [66]Royal Military College,
   Sandhurst and came fifth out of one-hundred and ten applicants. After
   ten months at Sandhurst, he passed out twelfth and was commissioned
   into the [67]6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons in 1881.

   In 1882, he joined his [68]regiment in [69]South Africa, and served in
   the [70]Bechuanaland Expedition of 1884-1885 on [71]patrol duties, and
   then in [72]Zululand in 1888. In 1889, as a [73]captain, he was made
   the [74]adjutant of the regiment, responsible for the turnout,
   discipline and routine of the unit and soon gained a reputation for
   strictness. He returned to Britain in 1890 with his unit, which was
   posted to [75]Brighton, during which time the regiment was confined to
   training and other routine duties. In 1893, Allenbys time as adjutant
   came to an end, and in 1894 he sat and failed the entry exam for the
   [76]Staff College in Camberley. Not deterred, he sat the exam again the
   next year and passed in twenty-first place, being the only
   [77]cavalryman to enter the college by competition and the first
   officer from his regiment ever to do so. On the same day, Captain
   [78]Douglas Haig of the [79]7th Hussars also entered the Staff College,
   albeit not by taking an exam, thus beginning a rivalry between the two
   that was to run until the [80]First World War. Different in character,
   Haig and Allenby both worked hard at Staff College, although the latter
   was more popular with fellow officers, even being made [81]Master of
   the Draghounds. Whereas Haig had few interests outside military
   affairs, Allenby had already developed a passion for poetry,
   [82]ornithology, travel and [83]botany. His Staff College assessment
   read as follows:

          This officer has sufficiently good abilities and much practical
          common sense. In all his work the practical bearing of the
          subject dealt with is always kept in view; and so long as the
          subject or situation falls within his knowledge, it is rapidly
          and thoroughly dealt with. In matters with which he is not so
          conversant he is not very good at working into details. He has
          energy, good judgement and rapid decision, and is a clear
          thinker and writer. He is active and a good soldier, and has the
          power of exerting influence on others and getting good work out
          of them.

   Before leaving Staff College in 1897, he was promoted to [84]Major and
   had also married Miss [85]Mabel Chapman, the daughter of a
   [86]Wiltshire landowner. In 1898, Allenby joined the 3rd [87]Cavalry
   [88]Brigade, then serving in [89]Ireland as the Brigade-Major.

[[90]edit] Boer War

   At the outbreak of the [91]Second Boer War, Allenby was returned to his
   regiment, and the Inniskillings were embarked at [92]Queenstown before
   landing at [93]Cape Town, [94]South Africa, on 11 December 1899 during
   the [95]Black Week in which the [96]British Army suffered reverses at
   [97]Colenso, [98]Magersfontein and [99]Stormberg. Allenby was made
   second in command of the Inniskillings and sent to Naauwpoort Junction
   to join [100]Major-General [101]John Frenchs Cavalry Division. In
   defending the northern frontier of the Cape, Frenchs division employed
   harassing tactics and threatened the flanks and rear of the Boers
   whilst not committing his force to a large scale operation. During this
   time Allenby gained a reputation for being a bold commander, having
   been given command of a squadron of cavalry, a role which suited
   Allenby more than second in command of the regiment. In one
   demonstration near [102]Colesberg on 14 January 1900, Allenby commanded
   two squadrons, two companies of mounted infantry and a section of
   artillery in penetrating Boer lines, shelling a bridge and avoiding an
   attempt by the enemy to cut his force off. Having suffered no
   casualties, Allenbys force returned having taken several prisoners. In
   February 1900, the Cavalry [103]Division executed a daring outflanking
   manoeuvre at [104]Modder River, in which Allenbys squadron took part.
   This led to the relief of [105]Kimberley, which had been besieged by
   the Boers since the wars outset. At Kimberley, Allenby resumed his
   acquaintance with [106]Cecil Rhodes, who entertained him to dinner and
   sent several supplies to his squadron. Later in the month, Allenbys
   squadron partook in the encirclement and capture of [107]Piet Cronjes
   force east of Kimberley. In March 1900, Allenbys [108]squadron led the
   final charge on [109]Bloemfontein and was successful in seizing a
   number of kopjes to the south of the city. A month later, the commander
   of the [110]Inniskillings was invalided home, and Allenby given
   temporary command of the regiment, during which it mostly undertook
   convoy duty. [111]Johannesburg was occupied on 31 May, and in June,
   during the advance on [112]Pretoria, Allenby engaged a party of Boers
   at Kalkheuvel Pass after the Cavalry Division was ambushed. After the
   capture of Pretoria, and during [113]Field Marshal [114]Lord Roberts
   push eastwards, the Inniskillings were active around the town of
   Middelburg in which a thinly held line was maintained for more than
   three weeks against an active enemy. Subsequently, Allenby led the
   Inniskillings in the advance on [115]Barberton and engaged the Boers at
   [116]Lake Chrissie, during which the Cavalry Division was continually
   engaged by the Boers in Eastern [117]Transvaal. The Cavalry Division
   was broken up into several smaller columns, and Allenby received the
   command of one of these in January 1901.

   The column period of the war lasted for eighteen months and took place
   across the Transvaal, the [118]Orange Free State, [119]Natal and the
   [120]Cape Colony an area equal to [121]Germany, [122]France and
   [123]Holland combined. The tactics of mobile [124]riflemen excelled due
   to the lack of railways metalled roads, and the vastness of the area of
   operations. Ultimately, Allenbys column never suffered a reverse or
   lost a convoy during this period of the war a fate that befell most
   column commanders at least once up to the end of the war. Allenby was
   daring and vigorous in pursuit of the enemy, no doubt helped by his
   considerable physical fitness. The column under his command varied,
   although it usually consisted of two regiments, a battery of [125]horse
   artillery, a long-range gun and half a battalion of infantry. This
   force was usually engaged in wearisome tasks entailing hard marching,
   outpost work during the evening and little prospect of seeing the
   enemy. In early 1901, the column operated alongside others under the
   command of French in the Eastern [126]Transvaal in operations against
   [127]Louis Botha. In the spring, the column operated near the
   [128]Swaziland border, in which heavy rain ensured that movement by men
   and horses was difficult, testing the resolve of the column commander
   and his men alike. During the weeks approaching summer, the column
   headed north to operate near Middelburg and then spent many months
   operating in Western Transvaal around the Magaliesburg hill range. His
   letters home to his wife began to include notable criticisms of
   superior officers and generals with no more brains or backbone than a
   bran doll. Allenbys column was promised a rest but soon found itself in
   Natal and then by October, operating around [129]Zululand. Allenby
   asked [130]Lord Kitchener, commanding in South Africa, to rest his
   weary column, and was duly promised a fortnights rest. However,
   Allenbys column was called to assist another British Army column that
   had suffered a considerable reverse at [131]Bakenlaagte, and it spent
   the remainder of 1901 in Eastern Transvaal.

   Towards the end of 1901, Allenby went down with [132]influenza and
   spent ten days leave in [133]Durban. Having been engaged in continual
   warfare in the field for two years, without holiday or accommodation,
   he was showing considerable signs of strain, and was joined in South
   Africa by his wife. She arrived in May 1902, after Allenbys column was
   engaged in combat in the Transvaal and north of the [134]Orange River
   Colony. On 31 May 1902, the [135]Peace of Vereeniging was declared,
   formally ending the [136]war. Allenby had showed himself to be gallant,
   dedicated, hard-working and resourceful in command who earned the
   plaudits of both Roberts and Kitchener. Along with other notable column
   commanders, Haig, [137]Herbert Plumer and [138]Julian Byng, Allenby was
   marked for future promotion, ending the war as a [139]Colonel.

[[140]edit] Interwar years

   He returned to Britain in 1902, being placed in command of the [141]5th
   Royal Irish Lancers and was stationed in [142]England until 1905.
   Promoted to [143]Brigadier-General, Allenby moved to [144]Colchester to
   assume command of the 4th Cavalry Brigade. In 1909, aged 48, he was
   promoted again to the rank of [145]Major-General due to his extensive
   cavalry experience, was appointed [146]Inspector-General of Cavalry in
   1910, with headquarters at [147]Horse Guards, London. Allenby became
   Inspector-General at a difficult time the Boer War and
   [148]Russo-Japanese War had assisted the growth of two differing
   outlooks regarding the role of cavalry in modern war. Whilst one side
   favoured shock action and had faith in the effectiveness of the sword
   and lance, the opposite contended that the cavalrys future lay in
   serving as [149]mounted infantry. Allenby chose to steer a middle path,
   in which the importance of firepower was emphasised through the
   introduction of the machine gun and the training of cavalrymen in
   infantry tactics, whilst the alternative of relying on shock action
   where necessary was kept open. Having studied the geography of Northern
   [150]France, and attended the manoeuvres of the French cavalry, Allenby
   highlighted the importance of the cavalry in retreat, recognising its
   ability to provide cover for the withdrawing infantry. With mounting
   responsibilities, the amiable element in Allenbys character publicly
   waned, ensuring that he was disliked by many subordinate officers and
   the cavalrys rank and file. His inspections were brisk and his manner
   abrupt. Furthermore, Allenbys pedantry for presentation was keenly felt
   by those cavalrymen under inspection. These somewhat repellent traits
   and Allenbys physical stature led others to refer to him as "The Bull".

[[151]edit] World War I

[[152]edit] Western Front

   During [153]World War I he initially served on the [154]Western Front.
   At the outbreak of war a [155]BEF was sent to France, consisting of
   four infantry divisions and one [156]cavalry [157]division, the latter
   commanded by Allenby, who distinguished himself when his unit covered
   the retreat after the [158]Battle of Mons. As the [159]BEF was expanded
   in size to two Armies, he was rewarded by being made commander of the
   Cavalry [160]Corps. In 1915 he commanded V Corps during the [161]Second
   Battle of Ypres and in October he took charge of the [162]British Third
   Army. However at the [163]Battle of Arras in the spring of 1917, his
   forces failed to exploit a breakthrough and he was replaced by
   [164]Julian Byng on 9 June. A significant reason for his removal from
   command and transfer was his continuing feud with Field Marshal Haig
   over tactical matters. Shortly after his arrival in [165]Egypt, he
   learned that his son, Michael, had been killed on the Western Front by
   German [166]artillery.

   Allenby's Monument in [169]Beersheba

   Allenby was sent to [170]Egypt to be made [171]commander-in-chief of
   the [172]Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) on 27 June 1917, replacing
   Sir [173]Archibald Murray. Allenby quickly won the respect of his men
   by making frequent visits to front line troops (something which Murray,
   who generally ran his campaigns by remote control from [174]Cairo,
   rarely did during his tenure with the EEF) and moving GHQ from
   comfortable Cairo to [175]Rafah, much nearer the front lines at
   [176]Gaza. His usual installation of discipline and organization,
   organizing the heretofore disparate forces of the EEF into three corps
   - the [177]XX and XXI Corps, both of infantry, and the [178]Desert
   Mounted Corps, made up of mostly [179]Australian Light Horse (mounted
   infantry). One of Allenby's first moves was to support the efforts of
   [180]T. E. Lawrence amongst the Arabs with 200,000 a month. Many of
   Allenby's men said after the war that they were willing to tolerate his
   strictness and rigidity because he gave the impression that he was in
   control of the situation, a feeling which Murray never inspired in his
   soldiers.

   Having reorganised his regular forces Allenby won the [181]Third Battle
   of Gaza (31 October - 7 November 1917) by surprising the defenders with
   an attack at [182]Beersheba.
   The victorious General Allenby dismounted, enters Jerusalem on foot out
   of respect for the Holy City, [183]December 11, 1917

   His force pushed on towards [184]Jerusalem, the [185]Ottomans were
   beaten at [186]Junction Station (November 13-15) and Jerusalem was
   captured on 9 December 1917.

[[187]edit] Honouring Jerusalem on foot

   Although he was a supreme master of cavalry horse [188]warfare, before
   entering [189]Jerusalem, Allenby dismounted and together with his
   officers, entered the city on foot through the [190]Jaffa Gate out of
   his great respect for the status of Jerusalem as the [191]Holy City
   important to [192]Judaism, [193]Christianity, and [194]Islam (see his
   proclamation of [195]martial law below). He subsequently stated in his
   official report:
     * "...I entered the city officially at noon, 11 December, with a few
       of my staff, the commanders of the French and Italian detachments,
       the heads of the political missions, and the Military Attaches of
       France, [196]Italy, and [197]America.
     * The procession was all afoot, and at Jaffa gate I was received by
       the guards representing [198]England, [199]Scotland, [200]Ireland,
       [201]Wales, [202]Australia, [203]New Zealand, [204]India,
       [205]France, and [206]Italy. The population received me well..."
       ^[207][2]

   He is also more controversially alleged to have said, 'today the
   crusades have ended'.^[208][3]

[[209]edit] Middle East victory

   Allenby leaving Jerusalem through the Jaffa Gate.

   The German offensive on the Western Front meant that Allenby was
   without reinforcements and after his forces failed to capture
   [210]Amman in March and April 1918 he halted the offensive. New troops
   from the Empire (specifically Australia, New Zealand, India and South
   Africa) led to the resumption of operations in August 1918. Following
   an extended series of deceptive moves the Ottoman line was broken at
   the [211]Battle of Megiddo (1921 September 1918) and the Allied cavalry
   passed through and blocked the Turkish retreat. The EEF then advanced
   at an enormous rate, (as high as 60 miles in 55 hours for cavalry, and
   infantry slogging 20 miles a day) encountering minimal resistance,
   [212]Damascus fell on 1 October, [213]Homs on 16 October, and
   [214]Aleppo on 25 October. [215]Turkey capitulated on 30 October 1918.

   Both [216]Tel-Aviv and [217]Haifa have a main street named for General
   Allenby, and one of the main bridges over the [218]Jordan River,
   between the [219]kingdom of [220]Jordan and Israel is the Allenby
   Bridge. In Jerusalem, one of the main British Army camps throughout the
   mandatory period was known as "Allenby Camp", and though no longer used
   by the [221]IDF, the location is still known by this name; it has some
   political significance as being the site earmarked for erecting a
   [222]US Embassy building in Jerusalem, if and when political and
   diplomatic conditions make moving the embassy from its present Tel-Aviv
   location possible. Altogether, present-day Israelis and Palestinians,
   even if not always knowing all the details of Allenby's biography, are
   very familiar with his name.

   Tel-Aviv, in 1917 a fledgling town founded just a few years before,
   suffered greatly from the [223]Ottoman authorities suspecting its
   inhabitants of pro-British tendencies (not entirely without reason) and
   evicting them en masse prior to the arrival of Allenby's troops. Some
   were forced to trudge as far as [224]Damascus. Following the British
   victory they were able to return to their town and regarded General
   Allenby as literally their saviour, naming for him what was Tel-Aviv's
   main street and the focus of economic and political life until the late
   1940s. In the 1950s the city center moved northwards, but [225]Allenby
   Street is still the center of downtown Tel-Aviv - though only few of
   the younger Tel-Avivians know for whom it was named.

[[226]edit] Promotions

   Allenby was made a [227]Field Marshal in 1919 and on 7 October of that
   year was created Viscount Allenby, of [228]Megiddo and of
   [229]Felixstowe in the [230]County of Suffolk. He remained in the
   [231]Middle East as [232]High Commissioner for [233]Egypt and the
   [234]Sudan until 1925 and he was instrumental in the creation of
   sovereign Egypt.

   On 7 May 1927 he was invited to lay the foundation stone of [235]St
   Andrew's Church, Jerusalem - a [236]Church of Scotland building
   constructed in memory of the Scottish soldiers who fought and died
   under his command in the region during [237]World War I.

   He retired in 1925 and died very suddenly, from a ruptured cerebral
   aneurysm, on 14 May 1936 in [238]London. His ashes were buried in
   [239]Westminster Abbey.^[240][4]

[[241]edit] In popular culture

   Publicity surrounding Allenby's exploits in the [242]Middle East was at
   its highest in Britain in the immediate aftermath of the First World
   War.

   [243]Lowell Thomas, the enterprising American journalist who helped
   make [244]T. E. Lawrence a household name throughout the world in the
   '20s, wrote of Allenby in a very complimentary manner in his book With
   Lawrence of Arabia and promoted him along with Lawrence in his
   documentary film With Allenby in Palestine and Lawrence in Arabia,
   covering the Middle Eastern campaign (Thomas had interviewed Allenby
   several times during the course of the war, and it was in fact Allenby
   who suggested Thomas use Lawrence as a subject).

   In the film [245]Lawrence of Arabia (1962), which depicts the Arab
   Revolt during World War I, Allenby is given a major part and is
   portrayed by [246]Jack Hawkins in one of his best-known roles. The
   portrayal of him is, however, rather negative (largely due to the
   screenwriter's anti-war sentiments). He is depicted as being an officer
   interested only in manipulating Lawrence for practical military
   reasons, which was admittedly true to some extent, though in real life
   Lawrence and Allenby thought very highly of each other and remained in
   correspondence for years after the war. Lowell Thomas in particular was
   critical of the film's portrayal of Allenby, saying that Hawkins lacked
   the "presence" and strength of Allenby. Allenby's descendents were so
   upset over his portrayal that they issued a formal complaint against
   [247]Columbia Pictures for the depiction of their ancestors.

   Contemporaneous to the film, Allenby was a supporting character
   fulfilling a very similar role in [248]Terrence Rattigan's
   controversial play [249]Ross (1960), where Allenby was portrayed by
   [250]John Williams in the original run.

   Allenby was also played by Australian actor [251]Anthony Hawkins in The
   Lighthorsemen (1987), and John Vine in The Adventures of Young Indiana
   Jones: Daredevils in the Desert (1992).

[[252]edit] Jerusalem proclamation

   Sir Edmund Allenby's official proclamation of [253]martial law
   following the fall of Jerusalem, 9 December 1917:
     * "To the Inhabitants of [254]Jerusalem the Blessed and the People
       Dwelling in Its Vicinity:
     * The defeat inflicted upon the [255]Turks by the troops under my
       command has resulted in the occupation of your city by my forces.
       I, therefore, here now proclaim it to be under [256]martial law,
       under which form of administration it will remain so long as
       military considerations make necessary.
     * However, lest any of you be alarmed by reason of your experience at
       the hands of the enemy who has retired, I hereby inform you that it
       is my desire that every person pursue his lawful business without
       fear of interruption.
     * Furthermore, since your city is regarded with affection by the
       adherents of three of the great religions of mankind and its soil
       has been consecrated by the prayers and pilgrimages of multitudes
       of devout people of these three religions for many centuries,
       therefore, do I make it known to you that every sacred building,
       monument, holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious
       bequest, or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of the
       three religions will be maintained and protected according to the
       existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they are
       sacred.
     * Guardians have been established at [257]Bethlehem and on
       [258]Rachel's Tomb. The [259]tomb at [260]Hebron has been placed
       under exclusive [261]Moslem control.
     * The hereditary custodians at the gates of the [262]Holy Sepulchre
       have been requested to take up their accustomed duties in
       remembrance of the magnanimous act of the [263]Caliph Omar, who
       protected that church."
