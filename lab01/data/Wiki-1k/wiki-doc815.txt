Economy of Palau

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   The economy of [8]Palau consists primarily of [9]subsistence
   agriculture and fishing. The government is the major employer of the
   work force, relying heavily on financial assistance from the [10]United
   States. The population enjoys a per capita income of more than twice
   that of the [11]Philippines and much of [12]Micronesia. Long-term
   prospects for the tourist sector have been greatly bolstered by the
   expansion of air travel in the Pacific and the rising prosperity of
   leading [13]East Asian countries.

   Palau's [14]per capita GDP of $5 800 makes it one of the wealthier
   Pacific Island states. [15]Nominal GDP increased by an annual average
   of nearly 14% from 1983 to 1990, and by an annual rate of over 10% from
   1991 to 1997. Growth turned sharply negative in 1998 and 1999 as a
   result of the [16]1997 Asian financial crisis.

[[31]edit] Industries

   [32]Tourism is Palau's main industry. Activity focuses on [33]scuba
   diving and [34]snorkeling among the islands' rich marine environment,
   including the [35]Floating Garden Islands to the west of [36]Koror. The
   number of visitors85% of whom come from [37]Japan, [38]Taiwan, and the
   U.S.reached nearly 67,000 in 1997, more than quadruple the level of a
   decade earlier. Tourism earned $67 million in foreign exchange for
   Palau in 1996, accounting for roughly half of [39]GDP. Arrivals from
   Asian countries dropped in 1998 and 1999 due to the regional economic
   downturn and the depreciation of many Asian currencies against the
   dollar, which made Palau's dollar-denominated prices more expensive.

   The service sector dominates the Palauan economy, contributing more
   than 80% of GDP and employing three-quarters of the work force. The
   government alone employs nearly 30% of workers. One of the government's
   main responsibilities is administering external assistance. Under the
   terms of the [40]Compact of Free Association with the United States,
   Palau will receive more than $450 million in assistance over 15 years
   and is eligible to participate in more than 40 federal programs. The
   first grant of $142 million was made in 1994. Further annual payments
   in lesser amounts will be made through 2009. U.S. grants in 1999
   totaled $24 million.

   Construction is the most important industrial activity, contributing
   over 9% of GDP. Several large infrastructure projects, including the
   rebuilding of the bridge connecting Koror and [41]Babeldaob Islands
   after its collapse in 1996 and the construction of a highway around the
   rim of Babeldaob, boosted activity at the end of 1990s.

   Agriculture is mainly on a subsistence level, the principal crops being
   coconuts, root crops, and bananas. Fishing is a potential source of
   revenue, but the islands' tuna output dropped by over one-third during
   the 1990s.

   There are no Patent Laws in Palau. [42][1]

[[43]edit] Economic challenges

   The main economic challenge confronting Palau is to ensure the
   long-term viability of its economy by reducing its reliance on foreign
   assistance. Palau has created a trust fund to be drawn upon after the
   cessation of Compact grants, the value of which had grown to $140
   million by the beginning of 2000.
