   Djelimady Tounkara

   Djelimady Tounkara is a [9]Malian musician and one of the foremost
   [10]guitarists in [11]Africa.

   Born in the culturally rich town of [12]Kita, east of the [13]Malian
   capital, [14]Bamako, Djelimady grew up surrounded with traditional
   music played by members of his family. The Tounkaras are [15]Griots,
   musicians and historians by birth. Djelimady played [16]djembe drum and
   [17]xalam, a banjo-like lute, as a boy. When he moved to Mali's
   capital, Bamako, during the 1960s, he had actually planned to work as a
   tailor. But music proved a stronger calling. He started playing guitar
   in a large, government-sponsored neighborhood band, Orchestre Misira.
   Voted the best guitarist in the band, Djelimady was selected to join
   the Orchestre National as rhythm guitarist, a great honor for the young
   player.

   All his adult life, Djelimady has worked to transform his ancestral
   traditions into dance pop. But at the same time, he has continued to
   work in more traditional contexts, backing the great griot singers of
   Mali on records, in concerts and at the day-long wedding and baptism
   celebrations that are the modern griot's life blood. In recent years,
   Djelimady has performed in an acoustic trio called [18]Bajourou,
   accompanied by another masterful griot guitarist, [19]Bouba Sacko, and
   by singer Lafia Diabate, a veteran of the Rail Band.

   Recently he has won the BBC 3 music award in [20][1] World Music -
   "Africa" category for his album titled Sigui.
