Earth's magnetic field

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search
   The [8]magnetosphere shields the surface of the Earth from the charged
   particles of the [9]solar wind and is generated by electric currents
   located in many different parts of the Earth. It is compressed on the
   day (Sun) side due to the force of the arriving particles, and extended
   on the night side. (Image not to scale.)
   The variation between magnetic north and "true" north.

   [10]Earth's [11]magnetic field (and the surface magnetic field) is
   approximately a [12]magnetic dipole, with one [13]pole near the
   [14]north pole (see [15]Magnetic North Pole) and the other near the
   geographic [16]south pole (see [17]Magnetic South Pole). An imaginary
   line joining the magnetic poles would be inclined by approximately 11.3
   from the planet's axis of rotation. The cause of the field can be
   explained by [18]dynamo theory.

   Magnetic fields extend infinitely, though they are weaker further from
   their source. The Earth's magnetic field, which effectively extends
   several tens of thousands of [19]kilometres into [20]space, is called
   the [21]magnetosphere.

   Two different types of magnetic poles must be distinguished. There are
   the "magnetic poles" and the "geomagnetic poles". The magnetic poles
   are the two positions on the Earth's surface where the magnetic field
   is entirely vertical. Another way of saying this is that the
   inclination of the Earth's field is 90 at the North Magnetic Pole and
   -90 at the South Magnetic Pole. A typical [36]compass that is allowed
   to swing only in the [37]horizontal plane will point in random
   directions at either the South or North Magnetic Poles.

   The Earth's field is closely approximated by the field of a dipole
   positioned near the centre of the Earth. A dipole defines an axis. The
   two positions where the axis of the dipole that best fits the Earth's
   field intersect the Earth's surface are called the North and South
   geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's field were perfectly dipolar, the
   geomagnetic and magnetic poles would coincide. However, there are
   significant non-dipolar terms which cause the position of the two types
   of poles to be in different places.

   The locations of the magnetic poles are not static; they wander as much
   as 15 km every year (Dr. David P. Stern, emeritus Goddard Space Flight
   Center, NASA^[[38]citation needed]). The pole position is usually not
   that which is indicated on many charts. The Geomagnetic Pole positions
   are usually not close to the position that commercial cartographers
   place "Magnetic Poles." "Geomagnetic Dipole Poles", "IGRF Model Dip
   Poles", and "Magnetic Dip Poles" are variously used to denote the
   magnetic poles.^[39][1]

   The Earth's field changes in strength and position. The two poles
   wander independently of each other and are not at directly opposite
   positions on the globe. Currently the magnetic south pole is farther
   from the geographic south pole than the magnetic north pole is from the
   geographic north pole.

[[48]edit] Field characteristics

   The strength of the field at the Earth's surface ranges from less than
   [49]30 microteslas (0.3 gauss) in an area including most of South
   America and South Africa to over [50]60 microteslas (0.6 gauss) around
   the magnetic poles in northern Canada and south of Australia, and in
   part of Siberia.

   The field is similar to that of a bar [51]magnet, but this similarity
   is superficial. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, or any other type
   of permanent magnet, is created by the coordinated [52]spins of
   [53]electrons and [54]nuclei within the [55]atoms. The Earth's core,
   however, is hotter than 1043 [56]K, the [57]Curie point [58]temperature
   at which the orientations of [59]spins within iron become randomized.
   Such randomization causes the substance to lose its magnetic field.
   Therefore the Earth's magnetic field is caused not by magnetized iron
   deposits, but mostly by [60]electric currents in the liquid outer core.

   Convection of molten iron within the outer liquid core, along with a
   [61]Coriolis effect caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to
   organize these "electric currents" in rolls aligned along the
   north-south polar axis. When conducting fluid flows across an existing
   magnetic field, electric currents are induced, which in turn creates
   another magnetic field. When this magnetic field reinforces the
   original magnetic field, a [62]dynamo is created which sustains itself.
   This is called the [63]Dynamo Theory and it explains how the earth's
   magnetic field is sustained.

   Another feature that distinguishes the [64]Earth magnetically from a
   bar magnet is its [65]magnetosphere. At large distances from the
   planet, this dominates the surface magnetic field. Electric currents
   induced in the [66]ionosphere also generate magnetic fields. Such a
   field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the
   Sun, causing daily alterations which can deflect surface magnetic
   fields by as much as one degree.

[[67]edit] Magnetic field variations

   Geomagnetic variations since last reversal.

   [68]Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic
   field caused by iron [69]artifacts, kilns, some types of stone
   structures, and even ditches and [70]middens in [71]archaeological
   geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne
   [72]magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect
   submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been
   mapped. The [73]basalt the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean
   floor contains a strongly magnetic mineral ([74]magnetite) and can
   locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by
   Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century. More important,
   because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic
   properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to
   study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic
   materials record the Earth's magnetic field.

   Frequently, the Earth's [75]magnetosphere is hit by [76]solar flares
   causing [77]geomagnetic storms, provoking displays of [78]aurorae. The
   short-term instability of the magnetic field is measured with the
   [79]K-index.

[[82]edit] Magnetic field reversals

          Main article: [83]Geomagnetic reversal

   Based upon the study of lava flows of [84]basalt throughout the world,
   it has been proposed that the Earth's magnetic field reverses at
   intervals, ranging from tens of thousands to many millions of
   [85]years, with an average interval of approximately 250,000 years. The
   last such event, called the [86]Brunhes-Matuyama reversal, is theorized
   to have occurred some 780,000 years ago.

   There is no clear theory as to how the geomagnetic reversals might have
   occurred. Some scientists have produced models for the core of the
   Earth wherein the magnetic field is only quasi-stable and the poles can
   spontaneously migrate from one orientation to the other over the course
   of a few hundred to a few thousand years. Other scientists propose that
   the geodynamo first turns itself off, either spontaneously or through
   some external action like a comet [87]impact, and then restarts itself
   with the magnetic "North" pole pointing either North or South. External
   events are not likely to be routine causes of magnetic field reversals
   due to the lack of a correlation between the age of impact craters and
   the timing of reversals. Regardless of the cause, when magnetic "North"
   reappears in the opposite direction this is a reversal, whereas turning
   off and returning in the same direction is called a [88]geomagnetic
   excursion.

   Studies of lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the
   magnetic field could have shifted at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day
   at some time in Earth's history, which significantly challenges the
   popular understanding of how the Earth's magnetic field works.^[89][4]

   This has been found to be consistent, by measuring magnetism across
   [90]ocean ridges. The molten [91]lava (typically basalt or
   [92]tholeiite) is extruded from volcanoes at well over the [93]Curie
   temperature and then cools to adopt whatever magnetic field was present
   at the time. As time goes on more lava flows and bands of opposite
   magnetic fields are made present.

   Using a magnetic detector (a variant of a compass), scientists have
   measured the historical direction of the Earth's magnetic field, by
   studying sequences of relatively iron-rich lava flows. Typically such
   layers have been found to record the direction of Earth's magnetic
   field when they cool (see [94]paleomagnetism). They have found that the
   poles have shifted a number of times throughout the past.

   An alternate theory of the core of the Earth and the origin of the
   Earth's magnetic field has been proposed by [95]J. Marvin Herndon. This
   proposal, known as the [96]georeactor is not accepted by the scientific
   community.

[[97]edit] Magnetic field detection

   Modeled Earth magnetic fields, data created by satellites with
   sensitive magnetometers

   The earth's magnetic field strength was measured by [98]Carl Friedrich
   Gauss in 1835 and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a
   relative decay of about 5% over the last 150 years ^[99][5] The
   [100]Magsat satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector
   magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of the Earths magnetic field.
   The later [101]rsted satellite allowed a comparsion indicating a
   dynamic geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an
   alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of S. Africa.^[102][6]

   [103]Governments sometimes operate units which specialise in the
   measurement of the [104]Earth's magnetic field. These are
   [105]Geomagnetic Observatories, typically part of a national
   [106]Geological Survey, for example the [107]British Geological
   Survey's [108]Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure
   and forecast magnetic conditions which can sometimes affect
   communications, electric power and other human activities; see
   [109]magnetic storm.

   The military can take a keen interest in determining the
   characteristics of the local geomagnetic field, in order to detect
   anomalies in the natural background, which might be caused by the
   presence of a significant metallic object such as a submerged
   submarine. Typically, these [110]magnetic anomaly detectors are flown
   in aircraft like the [111]UK's [112]Nimrod or towed as an instrument or
   an array of instruments from surface ships.

   Commercially, [113]geophysical [114]prospecting companies also use
   magnetic detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from
   [115]ore bodies, such as the [116]Kursk Magnetic Anomaly.

   Animals including [117]birds and [118]turtles can detect the Earth's
   magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during
   migration.^[119][7].
