[[57]edit] History

   East Cleveland incorporated as a village in 1895 and became a city in
   1911. This charter included provisions for women's suffrage, which at
   the time was unheard of in all regions east of Chicago. Before the
   charter had passed, the city of [58]Cleveland unsuccessfully attempted
   to annex the emerging municipality in 1910 and again in 1916.

   Within East Cleveland sits [59]Nela Park, the world's first industrial
   park.^[[60]citation needed] Nela Park continues to operate today as the
   functional headquarters for [61]GE Lighting and is the city's second
   largest employer. Huron Hospital, a satellite hospital of the
   [62]Cleveland Clinic, is the city's largest employer. Huron Hospital is
   a notable health care facility, being the only Level-II trauma center
   between Cleveland's MetroHealth Medical Center, located on West 25th
   Street, and Hillcrest Hospital, located in Mayfield Heights.

   East Cleveland includes a portion of [63]Euclid Avenue, which from the
   1860s through the 1920s was known as "Millionaire's Row". The many
   estates along this stretch of road in East Cleveland included the
   248-acre (1.00 km^2) home of the late [64]John D. Rockefeller,
   [65]Standard Oil founder and "the worlds first billionaire".

   By the [66]Great Depression a great number of homes along
   "Millionaire's Row" were demolished or abandoned. Although commercial
   properties and fast-food chains replaced many Euclid Avenue homes
   during the second half of the 20th century, East Cleveland is still
   home to 18 of the original "Millionaire's Row" homes, while only six
   are left in the city of Cleveland.

   After [67]World War II, development of other suburbs within the region
   brought a number of changes to East Cleveland. By the 1960s, African
   Americans constituted an increasingly large portion of the city's
   population. By 1984, East Cleveland was one of the largest primarily
   black communities in Ohio, with a population of 36,957.

[[68]edit] Government and Politics

   East Cleveland City Hall

   East Cleveland is a Charter city that is granted its authority under
   the home rule provisions of the Ohio constitution.

   Prior to 1985 East Cleveland had been under the leadership of a
   Commission and City Manager. In 1985 voters grew frustrated with that
   form of government^[[69]citation needed] after two commissioners were
   charged with theft in office, and after a revolving door of city
   managers resulted in little stability and a reduction in services.
   Citizens for Sound Government, a group of residents, led a petition
   drive to elect a strong mayor and to create a five-member city council.
   Attorney Darryl E. Pittman became the first mayor to lead the city
   since 1908. He was sworn in on January 1, 1986.

   After two years on the job, in Pittman's second two-year term, Ohio's
   State Auditor declared on September 9, 1988 that East Cleveland was in
   fiscal emergency. The fiscal emergency designation came after the water
   and sewer fund had deficits in excess of $2 million. Pittman was
   defeated in 1989 by Wallace D. Davis, the council president and a
   funeral home owner. Prior to his defeat, Pittman convinced former U.S.
   Rep. Louis Stokes to support a congressional amendment that made East
   Cleveland a "direct entitlement city" under HUD. That designation gave
   the city the authority to receive more than $1 million a year in block
   grant funding directly from HUD.

   Instead of the money being a blessing to the struggling city, it was
   badly mismanaged under the Davis administration when he hired Emmanuel
   W. Onunwor, who would later defeat him as mayor in 1997, to lead the
   Department of Community Development. Not only did Onuwnor mismanage
   millions in federal funds, his leadership of the Department of
   Community Development led to hundreds of properties being
   boarded-up^[[70]citation needed] and HUD demanding a return of its
   funds after two derogatory state and federal audits.

   Davis also borrowed $2.5 million that had to be paid back in eight
   years to get the city out of fiscal emergency. His administration made
   the last payment in 1997, but the city remained in fiscal emergency
   throughout Onunwor's eight-year term in office, and after he was
   indicted and convicted on federal charges of racketeering and
   corruption in 2004. Onunwor was sentenced to nine years in federal
   prison in September 2004. He was temporarily replaced by then Council
   President Saratha Goggins, who was later exposed by the media for
   having stabbed an ex-boyfriend to death while she was married.

   Current Mayor Eric J. Brewer became the city's fourth elected CEO on
   [71]January 1, [72]2006, and now presides over a city that was removed
   from fiscal emergency one month after he took office. Mayor Brewer - an
   investigative journalist and newspaper publisher who had served as a
   Special Assistant to retired Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White, and as
   Onunwor's Chief of Staff before he went to federal authorities to
   report incidents of corruption - has worked to restore normalcy to city
   hall.

   Mayor Brewer successfully negotiated an agreement with Cleveland Mayor
   Frank Jackson to takeover East Cleveland's water department on January
   8, 2008; a 25-year agreement that lowered water rates from $47 to $27
   per 1,000 cubic feet (28 m^3). He also convinced Cuyahoga County
   Sheriff Gerald McFaul to send eight deputies to assist the city's
   police department, in addition to hiring 26 new police officers to
   patrol the city's streets. Mayor Brewer keeps residents informed about
   the city through a weekly, televised town hall meeting.

[[101]edit] Crime

   The city of East Cleveland has a high although declining crime rate. In
   2002, the city experienced 6 murders, compared to in 2004 where no
   murders took place. There were 36 rapes in the city in 2002. Although
   the numbers appear low, these statistics show East Cleveland to be
   considered one of America's more dangerous per capita. In 2002 the city
   had nearly three times the crime index that the nation had as a whole.
   That said, factors including, depopulation, and better policing have
   lead to lower crime totals in recent years. The city's north side is
   considered more dangerous than the southern neighborhoods which border
   the suburb of Cleveland Heights.

   The city of East Cleveland is a home rule city with its own charter.
   City government consists of a mayor, five members of city council and a

   million renovation of all its public school buildings between 1998 and
   2008. Shaw High School, Heritage Middle School (formerly Kirk Middle
   School), and Caledonia and Mayfair elementary schools have all been
   rebuilt. Prospect, Chambers, and Superior elementary schools have all
   been renovated.

   Eric J. Brewer is East Cleveland's current mayor. Brewer, a Democrat,
   earned 55 percent of the vote in a four-person October 2005 primary,
   defeating the incumbent mayor and city council president. Brewer then
   went on to defeat his Republican opponent with a landslide 85 percent
   margin in the November 2005 general election.^[112][4]
