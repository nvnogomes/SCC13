Edah HaChareidis

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Eda Haredit)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   The Edah HaChareidis ([9]Hebrew: HaEdah HaChareidis The Chareidi
   Community), also written Edah Haredit, and popularly also known as the
   [10]Badatz, is a prominent anti-Zionist [11]Haredi communal
   organization in present-day [12]Jerusalem, consisting of several Haredi
   groups representing most of the Yerushalmi (traditional pre-war)
   Jerusalem community. It provides all the facilities required by a
   Jewish community, including [13]kashrus, [14]mikvas, an [15]eruv and a
   rabbinical court. The Edah HaChareidis is considered a continuation of
   the former leaders of the [16]Yishuv haYashan, and is well known for
   being strongly opposed to [17]Zionism, which it condemns as heretical
   and opposed to Judaism.^[18][1]

   There is also an Edah HaCharedit HaSefaradit representing [19]Sephardi
   Jewry. While the Sephardi Edah holds similar viewpoints to the
   Ashkenazi Edah regarding Zionism and the State of Israel, they are not
   officially affiliated with each other.

   The Edah was founded by Rabbi [62]Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld and Rabbi
   Yitzchok Yerucham Diskin (son of Rabbi [63]Yehoshua Leib Diskin, Rabbi
   of [64]Brisk, Lithuania) in 1919, prior to the establishment of the
   [65]Chief Rabbinate by the [66]Zionist movement under British auspices.
   Rabbi Sonnenfeld was named the first [67]Av Beis Din of the Edah
   Chareidis, a position he held until his passing in 1932. His tenure saw
   the [68]Ottoman Empire's control over the [69]Land of Israel weakening,
   and the British gaining control of the [70]British Mandate of Palestine
   after [71]World War I.

   The British chose to create a new Zionist rabbinical hierarchy under
   the newly-created Chief Rabbinate of Palestine, which later became the
   [72]Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Rabbi [73]Abraham Isaac Kook became the
   first [74]Chief Rabbi in 1921. The Edah HaChareidis, which was - and
   still is - strongly [75]anti-Zionist, resisted these moves and opposed
   the new British-created Zionist Chief Rabbinate.

   Rabbi Sonnenfeld was succeeded by Rabbi [76]Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky. He
   was succeeded by Rabbi Zelig Reuven Bengis, who was succeeded by the
   [77]Satmar [78]Rebbe, Grand Rabbi [79]Joel Teitelbaum. Rabbi Teitelbaum
   emigrated to the United States, but retained his position as Av Beis
   Din of the Edah HaChareidis. Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's nephew, the late
   Grand Rabbi [80]Moshe Teitelbaum of Satmar, was given the title of
   President, upon Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's passing. Meanwhile, in 1945,
   [81]Agudath Israel, formerly aligned with the Edah, broke away from it.

   The lay leader of the Edah HaChareidis for many years was [82]Gershon
   Stemmer, until his death in early 2007.

[[83]edit] Anti-Zionist Ideology

   The anti-Zionist stance of the Edah is supported by the book [84]Vayoel
   Moshe, written by former Edah President and Chief Rabbi [85]Joel
   Teitelbaum, which is regarded as the standard using which all issues
   relating to the modern State of [86]Israel are determined. For example,
   the Edah forbids voting in the elections for the [87]Knesset, and
   forbids accepting any funding from the Israeli government (such as
   subsidies for schools and unemployment benefits), nor to accept Israeli
   citizenship through the Law of Return.^[88][2]^[89][3] According to
   Ynetnews, "It [the Edah} has declared an ideological war against the
   "heretic Zionist government"."^[90][3]

   Despite the anti-Zionist stance of the Edah HaChareidis, a fragile
   cooperation is maintained with the state-run Chief Rabbinate, for
   example for the purpose of registering marriages and divorces (although
   this aspect does predate the state of Israel). On the other hand,
   [91]converts to Judaism who convert through the Edah HaChareidis (like
   converts through all non-government organizations) are not recognized
   as Jews by the state for the purpose of obtaining Israeli citizenship
   via the [92]Law of Return.^[93][4]

   In 2002, the rabbinical leadership of the Edah wrote a complimentary
   introduction to Vayoel Moshe. The introduction mentioned: "and it is
   necessary to learn about this subject [of Zionism]... the holy book
   Vayoel Moshe will open [its readers] eyes to see [the reasons behind]
   all troubles and horrors of our time, and will prevent readers from
   being drawn after the Zionist heresy, may the Merciful One save
   us."^[94][5]

   In 2006, during a campaign against the participation of Haredim in the
   Israeli parliamentary elections, the Edah accused the Zionists of
   having played a role in the Holocaust. ^[95][6]

   In March 2008, an article in the Edah's newspaper HaEdah blasted the
   'first chassidic police officer' and the newspapers who had praised
   him, and called for him to be thrown out of the Haredi world. It
   referred to him as presenting his children to [96]Molech. Addressing
   him personally, it said, "and even if you are great in your own eyes,
   you are worth nothing and an embarrassment to us", and, "we will
   continue our continuous war, the days of which are the same as the days
   of the existence of the Zionist entity, against them and against
   everything you represent."^[97][7]

[[98]edit] Influence

   Followers of the movements which constitute the Edah mainly live in the
   northern areas of Jerusalem (from [99]Har Nof to [100]Sanhedria) and
   [101]Beit Shemesh. In practice, through its kashrus authority and
   halachic decisions made by its leaders, its influence is felt
   throughout Israel and in much of the Diaspora.

   The Edah publicizes a weekly magazine called Ha'Edah ("The Edah"),
   written in Hebrew. This magazine is used to publicize the views of the
   leadership of the Edah on various issues, as well as articles on Jewish
   thought including the weekly [102]Torah portion and biographies of
   deceased leaders of the Yerushalmi community.

[[103]edit] Kashrus supervision

   The Edah HaChareidis is known for its high standards in rabbinical
   supervision of [104]kosher food, and is considered to be one of the
   strictest [105]hechsheirim in [106]Israel. It is often simply known as
   the hechsher of the "Badatz", which stands for [107]Beis Din Tzedek or
   "Court [of] Righteous Law". Products certified by the Edah are marked
   with the well-known logo of the Edah.

[[108]edit] The chareidi groups which comprise the Edah

   The Edah is mainly formed by people whose ancestors arrived in
   Jerusalem and the Land of Israel long before the founding of the State
   of Israel. Many of them maintain the classical customs of Jerusalem -
   the Yerushalmi minhagim - such as the gold kaftan worn on [109]Shabbos,
   seen in the picture on the right.
