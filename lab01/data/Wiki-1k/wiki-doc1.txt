   Disney's Animal Kingdom is a [26]theme park at the [27]Walt Disney
   World Resort. The fourth park built at the resort, it opened on
   [28]April 22, [29]1998, and it is the largest single Disney theme park
   in the world, covering more than 500 acres (2 km). It is also the first
   Disney theme park to be themed entirely around [30]animal conservation,
   a philosophy once pioneered by [31]Walt Disney himself^[32][1].
   Disney's Animal Kingdom is accredited by the [33]Association of Zoos
   and Aquariums, meaning they have met and exceeded the standards in
   Education, Conservation and Research. ^[34][2]

   Shortly after the park opened, Disney advertised the park using the
   fictional word "nahtazu"^[35][3]. Pronounced "not a zoo," the word
   emphasized that the park was more than animal displays found in a
   typical city zoo. Disney stopped using the phrase in January of 2006.

   In [36]2007, the park hosted approximately 9.49 million guests, ranking
   it the fifth-most visited amusement park in the United States and
   eight-most visited in the world.^[37][4]

   Welcome to a kingdom of animals... real, ancient and imagined: a
   kingdom ruled by lions, dinosaurs and dragons; a kingdom of balance,
   harmony and survival; a kingdom we enter to share in the wonder, gaze
   at the beauty, thrill at the drama, and learn.

[[60]edit] Themed areas

   The park is made up of seven themed areas. However, the original plans
   called for another area called "Beastly Kingdom"^[61][5].
   Animal Kingdom entrance

[[62]edit] Oasis

   Upon entering the park, guests must walk through this area to get into
   any of the other lands in the park. The Oasis consists of different
   paths leading to Discovery Island which walk guests past animal
   habitats such as [63]muntjac, [64]cavy, [65]spoonbills, [66]ducks,
   [67]fish, [68]turtles, [69]wallabies, giant [70]anteaters,
   [71]babirusa, [72]Hyacinth Macaws, and others. A [73]Rainforest Cafe is
   also located at the entrance of the Oasis.

[[74]edit] Discovery Island

   A closeup view of the Tree of Life

   The main land in the park (previously known as Safari Village),
   Discovery Island is the center island in the park and has paths to all
   six of the other lands. It is also the home of [75]The Tree of Life.
   According to "The Imagineering Field Guide to the Animal Kingdom," each
   of the restaurants and shops is themed around a certain group of
   animals (i.e. nocturnal animals, animals with spots, etc.)

   Here you'll see [76]kangaroos, [77]flamingos, [78]axis deer, West
   African crowned [79]cranes, [80]vultures, [81]porcupines, [82]lemurs,
   [83]macaws, [84]ducks, [85]Galapagos tortoise, small-clawed [86]otters,
   saddlebill [87]storks, and more.
     * [88]It's Tough to be a Bug - At the roots of The Tree of Life, Flik

       featuring songs and characters from the film [97]The Lion King.

[[98]edit] Africa

   Set in the fictional village of Harambe, the [99]Africa section
   contains a number of animal adventures. According to "The Imagineering
   Field Guide to the Animal Kingdom," Harambe's backstory says that it
   was once part of a [100]Dutch colony, but a peaceful revolution made
   Harambe self-governing in 1963.
     * [101]Kilimanjaro Safaris - Guests climb aboard an open-sided safari
       vehicle for an expedition seeing many African animals. Animals from
       Africa freely roam through acres of savanna, rivers and rocky
       hills. The guests can see [102]giraffes, [103]hippos,
       [104]elephants, [105]rhinoceroses, [106]lions and other animals,
       while later embarking on a mission to stop some ivory poachers.

   The Africa area features an exhibit of Silverback [107]Gorillas
     * [108]Pangani Forest Exploration Trail - The guest treks into the
       forest in search of [109]gorillas. Along the way, the guest goes on
       a nature walk through a verdant African valley filled with
       [110]Nile hippos, [111]birds and [112]fish and enters an exotic
       bird aviary, a research centre with [113]naked mole-rats and
       various [114]rodents and [115]reptiles, an underwater hippo viewing
       area, a savanna overlook, and has an intimate up-close encounter
       with a magnificent troop of gorillas.

[[116]edit] Rafiki's Planet Watch

   Accessible by train only, this area, hosted by [117]Rafiki, contains
   small animals, a petting zoo with [118]domesticated [119]goats, and
   exhibits teaching about conservation efforts. The veterinary hospital's
   viewing window allows guests to watch medical procedures conducted by
   the veterinary staff.
     * [120]Wildlife Express Train - Guests ride the rails on this rustic
       African train that travels the savanna for a behind-the-scenes
       journey through several animal housing and care areas of the park.
       On the return trip, the train passes near the Asia section of the
       park.
     * Habitat Habit! - Guests see endangered [121]cottontop tamarin
       primates up close, trekking down an adventure trail and learning of
       novel ways to help animals.

       with [123]goats, [124]sheep, [125]pigs, [126]chicken, [127]llamas
       and more. Some of the park's friendlier animals make special guest
       appearances.
     * Conservation Station - At the trail's end, guests can visit the
       center of Disney efforts to promote wildlife conservation
       awareness. Inside are a variety of wild animal experiences,
       interactive games and shows.

[[128]edit] Asia

          Main article: [129]Asia (Animal Kingdom)

   [130]Asia was the first expansion land added to Disney's Animal
   Kingdom, first opening in [131]1999. Like Africa, the section's
   attractions are part of a fictional village, Anandapur. According to
   "The Imagineering Field Guide to the Animal Kingdom," the official
   language of Anadapur is [132]Sanskrit.
   The mountains of Expedition: Everest.
     * Flights of Wonder - Guests join a trainee bird handler and a
       wayward tour guide who teach each other about the delicate state of
       nature and see birds such as [133]vultures, [134]hawks, colorful
       [135]macaws, crowned [136]crane and the [137]American Bald Eagle up
       close.
     * [138]Kali River Rapids - Guests raft down the turbulent waters of
       the "Chakranadi River" aboard a 12-passenger raft through an Asian

     * [139]Maharajah Jungle Trek - Guests trek into the lush forests for
       an adventure into the wilds of the mystical Anandapur Royal Forest
       of Southeast Asia and respective ancient ruins, having up-close

       species in the world), [142]tapirs, [143]birds, and [144]tigers.
     * [145]Expedition Everest - In this runaway-train roller coaster,
       Himalayan trekkers board refurbished steam trains on their way to
       the base camp of Mount Everest, using a shortcut that passes
       through the "forbidden mountain" guarded by the legendary
       [146]yeti.

[[147]edit] DinoLand U.S.A.

          Main article: [148]DinoLand U.S.A.

     * The Boneyard - Guests slip, slide, slither and slosh through a play
       maze filled with fun fossils. "Exploration. Excavation.
       Exultation." is the motto of the Dino Institute and nowhere is this

       a world of dinosaur discoveries like a [149]Triceratops,
       [150]Tyrannosaurus rex, and [151]Woolly Mammoth.
     * [152]DINOSAUR (formerly Countdown to Extinction) - Guests whoosh
       back to primeval times for a wild ride of an expedition to complete
       a dangerous mission. Guests have mere minutes to rescue a stray
       dinosaur, and must beware the hungry clutches of one large
       meat-eating predator and the devastating power of an impending
       asteroid.
     * Animals located in Dinoland include an [153]American Crocodile,
       [154]Abdim's Storks, and Asian brown [155]tortoises.
     * [156]Finding Nemo - The Musical - Officially the park's newest
       attraction, the show debuted on [157]November 12, [158]2006. This
       original stage show was developed by [159]Walt Disney Creative
       Entertainment and tells the story of the Disney/Pixar film
       [160]Finding Nemo with new songs by [161]Avenue Q composer
       [162]Bobby Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and puppets designed

       animated backdrops, and theatrical puppetry. Marlin, Dory and Nemo
       are depicted by actors holding large puppets while other characters
       are portrayed through a variety of puppetry styles. The show

     * Dino-Sue - Disney's oldest "cast" member, clocking in at 67 million
       years, Dino-Sue is a painstaking reproduction of the largest, most
       complete T-Rex ever found. The length of a four-story building, the
       mighty T-Rex is available to pose for pictures with guests at the
       Dino institute.
     * Cretaceous Trail - Cretaceous Trail is a walking tour amidst plant
       and animal survivors that have outlived the dinosaurs. Guests play

       four-person flying dinosaur.

[[169]edit] Beastly Kingdom

   Animal Kingdom's original logo which includes a dragon at the center.

   Disney's Animal Kingdom focuses on three broad classifications of
   animals: those that exist today; those that did exist, but are now
   extinct (i.e., dinosaurs); and, those that exist in legend and
   mythology.^[170][5] In the original design for the park, the animals of
   legend were to have their own section.

   Beastly Kingdom (supposedly spelled in Old English as "Beastly
   Kingdomme") was to have featured mythical animals such as unicorns,
   dragons, and sea monsters. The land would feature realms of both good
   and evil creatures. The evil side would be dominated by Dragon Tower, a
   ruined castle home to a greedy fire-breathing dragon who hordes a
   fabulous treasure in the tower chamber. The castle is also inhabited by
   bats who plan to rob the dragon of his riches. They enlist the guests'
   help in their scheme, and whisk them off on a thrilling roller coaster
   ride through the castle ruins. The climax of the ride is an encounter
   with the evil dragon himself, resulting in a nearly-barbecued train of
   guests.^[[171]citation needed]

   The good side of this land would be home to Quest of the Unicorn, an
   adventure which sends guests through a maze of medieval mythological
   creatures to seek the hidden grotto where the unicorn lives. Finally,
   the Fantasia Gardens attraction would be a musical boat ride through
   the animals from Disney's animated classic, [172]Fantasia. The ride
   would feature both the crocodiles and hippos from " Dance of the Hours"
   and the Pegasus, fauns, and centaurs from Beethoven's
   "Pastoral."^[[173]citation needed]

   Due to budget constraints of the Walt Disney Company, Beastly Kingdom
   never came to fruition and Camp Minnie-Mickey was built as a temporary
   tenant of the Beastly Kingdom's land.

   The change was supposedly rather sudden, as remnants of this planned
   area were visible when the park opened. One such remnant was a
   fire-breathing dragon in the Discovery River Boats attraction. Said
   dragon was visible from the Camp Minnie-Mickey bridge for several
   years, roaring loudly and spewing fire from a rocky cave. In addition,
   one of the [174]McDonald's Animal Kingdom-themed [175]Happy Meal toys
   was a winged purple dragon.

   Legend has it that Disney laid off the [176]Imagineers who had planned
   the Beastly Kingdom, and they were subsequently hired to create the
   [177]Dueling Dragons and the [178]Flying Unicorn attractions for
   Universal's [179]Islands of Adventure theme park^[[180]citation
   needed].

   Even now, hints of a mythological land still exist, including:
     * The Unicorn parking area
     * The original Animal Kingdom logo, which prominently features the
       silhouette of a dragon, and still appears throughout the park
     * The dragon-shaped stone fountain near Camp Minnie-Mickey
     * The detailed dragonhead statue which sits atop one of the ticket
       booths at the park's entrance (the other two are topped by an
       elephant head and a triceratops head).

   As Expedition Everest includes a yeti, an animal that may or may not
   exist, the park now features at least one attraction for each of the
   three categories the park was originally built to represent.

   As to Beastly Kingdom's future, Joe Rohde said in 2000: "We had a
   vision and now it's become a place holder. We have all kinds of ideas
   and not all of them fit with the theme of Beastly Kingdom. I'm not even
   convinced there will be a Beastly Kingdom."^[181][6].

[[182]edit] Restaurants and shops

   Rainforest Cafe

   The park contains three [183]table service [184]restaurants:
     * [185]Rainforest Cafe, located just outside the main entrance (also
       accessible from inside the park);
     * [186]Yak & Yeti, an Asian-themed restaurant located in the park's
       Asia section (operated by [187]Landry's Restaurants) that opened on
       [188]November 14, [189]2007; and
     * Tusker House, located in Africa and one of the park's original
       quick-service restaurants, was converted into a buffet restaurant
       and re-opened on [190]November 17, 2007.

   Tusker House hosts "Donald's Safari Breakfast," a character-dining
   event where guests enjoy a breakfast buffet while meeting [191]Donald
   Duck and other Disney characters.

   There are five quick-service restaurants located throughout the park:
     * Flame Tree [192]Barbecue, on Discovery Island near DinoLand USA;
     * Pizzafari, also on Discovery Island, near Camp Minnie-Mickey;
     * Restaurantosaurus, in DinoLand USA;
     * Tamu Tamu Refreshments, in Africa; and,
     * Yak & Yeti Local Foods Caf, located next to the larger Yak & Yeti
       table-service facility.

   As with other Walt Disney World theme parks, Disney's Animal Kingdom
   has other locations and carts that offer snacks and beverages.

[[193]edit] Operations

   Much concern was brought to the animals' well-being when the park
   originally opened^[194][7]. The park typically closes earlier than
   other [195]parks in the [196]Walt Disney World Resort. The animals are
   said to require a strict schedule to avoid stress, so even on nights
   when the park is open later, animals usually will be brought "off
   stage" an hour or two before the park officially closes for the
   day^[[197]citation needed]. Another notable difference from other
   Disney parks is that Animal Kingdom does not have a fireworks show in
   consideration to the animals.

[[198]edit] Controversy

   Even in planning stages, various Florida based animal rights groups and
   [199]PETA didn't like the idea of Disney creating a theme park where
   animals were held in captivity. The groups protested, and PETA tried to
   convince travel agents not to book trips to the park. ^[200][8] A few
   weeks before the park opened, a number of animals died due to
   accidents. The [201]United States Department of Agriculture viewed most
   of the cases and found no violations of animal-welfare regulations.
   ^[202][9] On opening day, the Orange County Sheriff's office sent about
   150 deputies in fear that there may be a large protest, but only two
   dozen protesters showed up. The protest lasted two hours, and there
   were no arrests. ^[203][10]

   One year after the park opened, Animal Rights Foundation of Florida
   complained that a New Year's Eve fireworks show may upset the animals.
   A USDA inspector came to the park to find no problems with launching
   low noise fireworks a half a mile away. ^[204][11]
