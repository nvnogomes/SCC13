   Born 1925
   White Plains, New York
   Residence [8]Maine
   Nationality [9]American

   Education PhD [10]Indiana University
   Occupation Professor of Folklore, retired
   Employer [11]University of Maine
   Known for folklorist

   Edward D. (Sandy) Ives (born 1925) is a [12]folklorist. His work has
   concentrated on the oral traditions of [13]Maine and the [14]Maritime
   Provinces of Canada, particularly, as he says, "on local songs and
   their makers but also on cycles of tales about local heroes."^[15][1]
   He founded the Maine Folklore Center in 1992 and was its director until
   his retirement in 1998.

   He grew up in [16]White Plains, New York, served in the Marines,
   studied literature in college and, beginning in 1955 he taught English
   at the [17]University of Maine. In 1962 he obtained a Ph.D. in folklore
   from [18]Indiana University and in 1964 he became a professor of
   Folklore at the University of Maine.

   He performed as a folk singer to supplement his income as a lecturer.
   This introduced him to the lumber camp singing tradition of Maine, New
   Brunswick and Prince Edward Island and he soon found his calling. In
   1957, he organized the Northeast Archives of Folklore and Oral History
   at the University of Maine. The next year, he founded the Northeast
   Folklore Society and began editing the monograph series Northeast
   Folklore.^[19][2] His [20]Folkways Records album, Folk Songs of Maine,
   was released in 1959.

   For more than forty years, he continued to explore the northeast oral
   tradition, publishing his findings with some regularity. Several of his
   books focus on individual subjects, whose names found their way into
   the titles of his books. This personalized approach permitted him to
   offer a deep exploration of the material and the subject, and himself.
   A reviewer has commented: "His books on Gorman, Scott, and Doyle are
   personal accounts of discovery, as much as studies of regional and
   occupational singing traditions. Ivess focus on the singers who gave
   him texts and on his own adventures in the field have made his studies
   models of contextual and reflexive scholarship."^[21][3]

   In his work in New Brunswick he was closely associated with [22]Louise
   Manny.
