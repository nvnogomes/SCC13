   Dongan Hills is a [14]Staten Island Railway train station in the
   neighborhood of [15]Dongan Hills, Staten Island, [16]New York. It is
   located on at embankment at Seaview Avenue and Railroad Avenue on the
   main line. It has two side platforms and beige canopies. This station
   is handicapped accessible in compliance of [17]Americans with
   Disabilities Act with ramps at the south end that lead to Seaview
   Avenue. The marble wall at street level on this end shows when the line
   was converted from grade level to the current embankment level today,
   which took place in 1933. The staircases at the north end lead to
   Garretson Avenue. Some free parking is available on a small lot
   adjacent to the northbound platform platform. The brick stationhouse is
   unusually positioned on northbound platform level, unlike other houses
   which are usually located on street level. This house had a ticket
   booth and benches until 1987, and then a token [18]vending machine
   until July 1997.

   South of this station, there is an additional third track that once
   served a late coal distributor. Grates between the rails led to chutes
   which now open into the backyards of homes that run alongside the
   embankment.
