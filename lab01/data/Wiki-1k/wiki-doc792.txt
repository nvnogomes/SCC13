From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   Sacha Dean Byan is a [9]fashion photographer and [10]photojournalist.

   Biyan was born on October 1, 1968 and grew up in [11]Montreal,
   [12]Canada. He began his career as a break dancer and club deejay in
   the mid 80s during the golden days of Electro and House music. He then
   went on to earn a Masters degree in Aeronautical Engineering and worked
   as a consultant in the aerospace industry for over ten years. Although
   he had no formal training in photography, he began experimenting with
   cameras, film and darkroom techniques at an early age. His affinity for
   photography eventually led him to switch careers again in his early
   thirties.

   Since then, Biyan has shot for clients such as Sony Music, Adidas, the
   Gap and Discovery, and his images have also appeared in magazines like
   GQ, Vogue and Marie Claire. He has held solo exhibitions of his works
   in Florence, Barcelona, Paris, Tokyo, So Paulo ^[13][1] , and most
   recently, Los Angeles as a benefit for [14]Amnesty International
   ^[15][2]. Biyan is also the author of the fine art book Spiritus Mundi,
   which documents his travels in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru,
   Guatemala, Indonesia, etc.^[16][3] And his fashion photographs served
   as the platform^[[17]vague] for the music CD, Dessous Presents
   Eccentris: Skin Is In as well as the iTunes album Eccentris Vibes, both
   released in 2006.

   [18]Favourite Website Awards has described his website, Eccentris.com,
   as "about as cutting edge as you will see."^[19][4] In 2002,
   [20]Communication Arts named the site one of its Interactive Annual 9
   winners ^[21][5] , and it was subsequently featured in the
   September/October 2003 issue of Communication Arts.^[22][6] His
   websites have also been showcased in Taschen's 1,000 Favorite
   Websites^[23][7] and Taschen's Web Design Portfolios^[24][8]. Biyan is
   presently based in New York City.
