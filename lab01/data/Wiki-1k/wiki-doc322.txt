[[28]edit] Biography

[[29]edit] Early years

   Albizu Campos was born in Teneras Village in [30]Ponce, Puerto Rico to
   Alejandro Albizu and Juana Campos. He was the nephew of [31]danza
   [32]composer [33]Juan Morel Campos and cousin of Puerto Rican educator
   Dr. [34]Carlos Albizu Miranda.

[[35]edit] Education

   In 1912, Albizu was awarded a scholarship to study [36]Engineering,
   specializing in [37]Chemistry at the [38]University of Vermont. In 1913
   he continued his studies at [39]Harvard University.
   Lieutenant Pedro Albizu Campos (U.S. Army)

   At the outbreak of World War I, he volunteered in the United States
   [40]Infantry. Albizu was trained by the [41]French Military mission and
   served under General [42]Frank McIntyre where he was assigned to an
   [43]African-American unit and was discharged as a [44]First Lieutenant.
   During this time he was exposed to the [45]racism of the day which left
   a mark in his beliefs towards the relationship of Puerto Ricans and the
   United States.

   In 1919, Albizu returned to [46]Harvard University and was elected
   president of Harvard's Cosmopolitan Club. He met with foreign students
   and lecturers, like [47]Subhas Chandra Bose (Indian Nationalist leader
   with [48]Mahatma Gandhi) and the Hindu poet [49]Rabindranath Tagore. He
   became interested in the cause of [50]Indian independence and also
   helped to establish several centers in [51]Boston for [52]Irish
   independence.

   Albizu met [53]amon de Valera and later became a consultant in the
   drafting of the constitution of the [54]Irish Free State. He graduated
   from Harvard University obtaining a Law degree while studying
   Literature, Philosophy, Chemical Engineering and Military Science. He
   was fluent in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian,
   Latin and Greek. At the time he received job offers as Hispanic
   representative for a Protestant church and in the [55]U.S. State
   Department's diplomatic corps in Mexico, yet Albizu opted to return to
   Puerto Rico.

[[56]edit] Nationalist campaign

   Puerto Rican Nationalist Party flag

   In 1922, Albizu married Dr. [57]Laura Meneses, a [58]Peruvian whom he
   had met at Harvard University. Two years later in 1924 he joined the
   [59]Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and was elected vice president. In
   1927, Albizu traveled to [60]Santo Domingo, [61]Haiti, [62]Cuba,
   Mexico, [63]Panama, Peru, and [64]Venezuela, seeking solidarity for the
   [65]Puerto Rican Independence movement.

   In 1930, there were some disagreements between Albizu and [66]Jos Coll
   y Cuch, president of the Party, as to how it should be run. As a result
   Coll y Cuch abandoned the party and some of his followers returned to
   the Union Party. On May 11, 1930, Albizu Campos was elected president
   of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and formed the first Women's
   Nationalist Committee, in the island municipality of [67]Vieques,
   Puerto Rico.

   In 1932, Albizu published a manuscript in which he accused Doctor
   [68]Cornelius P. Rhoades of killing Puerto Rican patients as part of
   medical experiments conducted in [69]San Juan's Presbyterian Hospital
   for the [70]Rockefeller Institute. Albizu quotes as his source a
   letter, received from a third party, in which the doctor purportedly
   admitted to injecting patients with live cancer cells. The letter also
   included inflammatory racist comments denigrating Puerto Ricans for
   their bad character. Investigations at the time did not publicly reveal
   evidence of malicious activity to support the claim and Dr. Rhoades was
   vindicated while Albizu was discredited. Dr. Rhoades went on to head
   two large chemical warfare projects in the 1940s and later served with
   the [71]United States Atomic Energy Commission. He was later awarded
   the U.S. [72]Legion of Merit.

   Years later, in 2003, after an independent investigation, the
   [73]American Association for Cancer Research would remove Dr. Rhoades'
   name from their annual award intended for an "individual on the basis
   of meritorious achievement in cancer research".

   The Nationalist Party obtained poor results in the 1932 election, but
   continued with their campaign to unite the people behind an independent
   Puerto Rico. At the same time, continued repression from the United
   States against Puerto Rican independence was now met with armed
   resistance.

   In 1933, Albizu led a [74]strike against the [75]Puerto Rico Railway
   and [76]Light and Power Company for alleged [77]monopoly on the island.
   The following year, he represented [78]sugar cane workers as a lawyer
   against the U.S. sugar industry.

[[79]edit] First Arrest

   In 1935, four Nationalists were killed by the police under the command
   of Colonel [80]E. Francis Riggs. The incident became known as the
   [81]Ro Piedras massacre. The following year in 1936, nationalists
   [82]Hiram Rosado and [83]Elias Beauchamp assassinated Colonel Riggs.
   They were arrested, and summarily executed without a trial at the
   police headquarters in San Juan.

   After these events, the San Juan Federal Court ordered the arrest of
   Albizu Campos and several other Nationalists for "seditious
   [84]conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. Government in Puerto Rico." A jury
   of seven Puerto Ricans and five Americans voted 7 to 5 not guilty.
   However, Judge Cooper called for a new jury, this time composed of ten
   Americans and two Puerto Ricans and a guilty verdict was achieved.

   In 1937, a group of lawyers, including a young [85]Gilberto Concepcin
   de Gracia tried in vain to defend the Nationalists, but the [86]Boston
   Court of Appeals, which holds jurisdiction over federal matters in
   Puerto Rico, upheld the verdict. Albizu Campos and the other
   Nationalist leaders were sent to the Federal penitentiary in
   [87]Atlanta, Georgia.

   In 1943, Albizu got seriously [88]ill and had to be interned at the
   [89]Columbus Hospital of [90]New York. He stayed there almost until the
   end of his sentence. After ten years of imprisonment, in 1947 Albizu
   returned to Puerto Rico and it was believed that he began preparing,
   along with other members of the Nationalist Party, an armed struggle
   against the proposed plans to change Puerto Rico's political status
   into a [91]commonwealth of the United States.

[[92]edit] Second Arrest

   Pedro Albizu Campos would be jailed again after two events: 1) the
   revolt of 1950 when a group of Puerto Rican [93]nationalists staged a
   revolt in the town of [94]Jayuya (known as the [95]Jayuya Uprising) and
   2) an attack on [96]La Fortaleza (the Puerto Rican governor's mansion)
   and [97]Blair House, by nationalist [98]Oscar Collazo and [99]Griselio
   Torresola, where president [100]Harry S. Truman was staying while the
   [101]White House was being renovated.

   During [102]the attack on the president, Torresola and policeman,
   [103]Private Leslie Coffelt, were killed. Albizu Campos was arrested at
   his home after a brief shoot out with the police. Subsequently 3,000
   independence supporters were arrested. In 1951 Pedro Albizu Campos was
   jailed again and sentenced to 80 years in prison.

   Albizu was pardoned in 1953 by then governor [104]Luis Muoz Marn but
   the pardon was revoked the following year after the [105]1954
   nationalist attack of the United States House of Representatives, when
   four Puerto Rican Nationalists, led by [106]Lolita Lebrn opened fire
   from the gallery of the Capitol Building in [107]Washington, D.C..

[[108]edit] Later years and death

   While in prison, Albizu Campos' health deteriorated. In 1956, he
   suffered a [109]stroke in prison and was transferred to San Juan's
   Presbyterian Hospital under police guard. He alleged that he was the
   subject of human [110]radiation experiments in prison. Officials
   suggested that Albizu was insane although many doctors were able to
   examine Albizu and test for signs of radiation. The President of the
   Cuban Cancer Association, Dr. Orlando Damuy, traveled to PR to examine
   him. The burns on his body were reported by Dr. Damuy, where he
   diagnosed that they were the cause of intense radiation. It is said
   when they placed a metal paper clip with a film on Albizu's skin, the
   clip was radiated into the film. It is also said he did not receive any
   medical attention for 5 days and instead suffered.

   On November 15, 1964 Albizu was again pardoned by Muoz Marin. He
   finally died on April 21, 1965.

   In 1994, under the administration of President [111]Bill Clinton, the
   [112]United States Department of Energy disclosed that human radiation
   "experiments" were conducted without consent on prisoners during the
   1950s and 1970s. Pedro Albizu Campos was among the subjects of such
   experimentation.

[[113]edit] Relationship with Prominent Latin American Figures

   Pedro Albizu Campos had very good relationships with many prominent
   figures of [114]Latin American politics. [115]Nobel Prize laureate and
   admirer of Albizu Campos, [116]Gabriela Mistral, presented a
   [117]tamarind tree to Albizu Campos as a symbol of her support for the
   [118]Puerto Rican Independence Movement. She obtained the [119]tamarind
   tree from the world-known [120]Venezuelan leader [121]Simn Bolivar's
   estate in [122]Venezuela. The tree was planted at the [123]Lares,
   Puerto Rico Plaza de la Revolucin with soil taken from the eighteen
   other Spanish-speaking [124]Latin American countries of the Hemisphere.

    Albizu Campos is a symbol of the as yet unfree but indomitable Latin
     America. Years and years of prison, almost unbearable pressures in
   jail, mental torture, solitude, total isolation from his people and his
    family, the insolence of the conqueror and its lackeys in the land of
   his birth nothing broke his will. [125]Che Guevara, speech given to the
         [126]United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1964.

   As inspired by Gabriela Mistral, Albizu Campos meant to give the Plaza
   a living symbol of solidarity with the struggle for freedom and
   independence initiated by Bolivar (who, while visiting [127]Vieques,
   Puerto Rico, promised to assist the [128]Puerto Rico independence
   movement, albeit said promise never materialized due to the power
   struggles surrounding him), as well as a symbol of the bittersweet (as
   the trees' flavor) hardships needed to reach [129]Puerto Rico's
   independence. As such, the [130]Tamarindo de Gabriela was meant to
   evoke the symbolism and significance afforded to the [131]Gernikako
   Arbola hailing from the [132]Basque Country, found between Spain and
   France.

[[133]edit] Legacy

   The extent of Albizu's legacy is generally the subject of passionate
   discussion by both followers and detractors. His followers state that
   Albizu's political and military actions served (even unintentionally)
   as a primer for positive change in Puerto Rico, these being:
     * the improvement of labor conditions for peasants and workers
     * a belated yet more accurate assessment of the colonial relationship
       between Puerto Rico and the United States by the political
       establishment in Washington
     * and a set of social and political conditions that led to positive
       change in the political - and eventually economic - environment
       prevailing in the country.

   Albizu can be definitely credited, however, with preserving and
   promoting Puerto Rican [134]nationalism and national symbols, at a time
   where they were virtually a [135]taboo in the country. The formal
   adoption of the Puerto Rican flag as a national emblem by the Puerto
   Rican government can be traced to Albizu (even while he denounced this
   adoption as the "watering-down" of an otherwise sacred symbol into a
   "colonial flag"); the revival of public observance of the [136]Grito de
   Lares and its significant icons was a direct mandate from him as leader
   of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.

   Albizu was the most vocal and visible Puerto Rican of African descent
   of his generation; Afro-Puerto Rican leaders of other political
   extractions (such as [137]Ernesto Ramos Antonini and [138]Jose Celso
   Barbosa) attained similar status only after facing (and enduring)
   considerable bouts with [139]racism. Albizu, while not exempt from it,
   confronted it and denounced it publicly.

   Albizu's diagnosis of the colonial relationship between Puerto Rico and
   the United States earned him prison time, yet modern scholars take
   surprise at how accurate the diagnosis is, even years after Albizu's
   death. Finally, his political philosophy persists to this day,
   synthesized in quotes and verbal images.

   An alternative high school in [140]Chicago, called the Dr. Pedro Albizu
   Campos Puerto Rican High School, is located in the Puerto Rican
   Cultural Center. There, students learn about [141]Puerto Rican history
   and culture, in the context of local community development. Archives
   there include original letters, representations of Albizu Campos in
   sculpture and art, as well as other material related to his life.

   Additionally, five public schools in Puerto Rico are named after him,
   as well as numerous streets in most of Puerto Rico's municipalities. In
   1976, Public School 161 in [142]Harlem in New York City was named after
   him as well.
