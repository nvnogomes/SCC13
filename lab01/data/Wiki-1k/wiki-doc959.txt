[[35]edit] Biography

   Harcourt was born at [36]Sudbury Hall, [37]Derbyshire on the [38]10
   October 1757. He was educated at [39]Westminster School; matriculated
   at [40]Christ Church, Oxford on the [41]2 July 1774 ; was elected
   fellow of [42]All Souls College in 1777 ; and graduated B.C.L. 27 April
   1786, and D.C.L. [43]4 May following. After his ordination he was
   instituted to the family living of [44]Sudbury. He became a canon of
   [45]Christ Church, Oxford, [46]13 October 1785, and a [47]prebendary of
   [48]Gloucester on [49]10 November in the same year . He resigned his
   prebendal stall in 1791, but held his other appointments to 1808.

   On [50]18 August 1791 he was nominated [51]Bishop of Carlisle^[52][2]
   in succession to Dr. [53]John Douglas, and was consecrated on [54]6
   November following. For sixteen years he administered the affairs of
   the see of Carlisle with good sense and discretion, spending more than
   the whole income of the see upon the wants of his diocese.^[55][1]

[[56]edit] Archbishop of York

   After the death of Archbishop [57]William Markiam. Harcourt was
   nominated on the [58]26 November 1807 as archbishop of York^[59][2],
   and was confirmed in St. James's Church, [60]Westminster on the [61]19
   January 1808.^[62][3] In the same year, on [63]20 January, he was
   gazetted a [64]privy councillor, and made [65]Lord High Almoner to
   [66]George III, an office which he also held under [67]Queen Victoria's
   reign.

   from the Ouse in 1995)

   Harcourt was a member of the queen's council who had charge of
   [69]George III during his illness. He was an eloquent speaker, and
   occasionally spoke in the [70]House of Lords on ecclesiastical matters,
   but usually abstained from political contentions. He lived under five
   successive monarchs, and was respected for benevolence and simplicity
   of character. On [71]15 January 1831 he took the surname of Harcourt
   only on inheriting the large estates of the Harcourt family, which came
   to him on the death of his cousin, Field-marshal [72]William, third and
   last Earl Harcourt.^[73][1]

   In 1835 he was appointed one of the first members of the ecclesiastical
   commission. In 1838 he was offered the renewal of the Harcourt peerage,
   but declined it, not wishing to be fettered in his parliamentary votes.
   [74]York Minster was twice burnt down during his primacy, 1829 and
   1841, and he contributed largely to both restorations. Archbishop
   Harcourt preached his valedictory sermon in York Minster on [75]13
   November 1838. However Harcourt continued to enjoy good health, and as
   late as [76]1 November 1847 visited York and inspected the repairs of
   the chapterhouse. He died at the palace, [77]Bishopthorpe, near
   [78]York, on [79]5 November 1847, and was buried at [80]Stanton
   Harcourt, Oxfordshire, [81]13 Nov^[82][1]

[[83]edit] Family

   On [84]5 February 1784 he married Anne Leveson-Gower, third daughter of
   Granville, first [85]marquis of Stafford and they had sixteen children.
   His wife died at [86]Bishopthorpe Palace on the [87]16 November 1832,
   aged 72.

   His second son, the Rev. Levesox Vernon Harcourt^[88][4], was
   chancellor of York and the author of The Doctrine of the
   Deluge,^[89][5], and of other theological works. His fourth son was
   [90]William Vernon Harcourt, the founder of the [91]British Association
   for the Advancement of Science. His eighth son was [92]Admiral Octavius
   Henry Cyril Harcourt^[93][1] whilst his youngest daughter,
   [94]Georgiana, distinguished herself as a translator.

[[95]edit] Cato Street conspiracy

   As a director of the Ancient Concerts, Harcourt entertained his
   fellow-directors (the [96]prince regent and [97]Prince Adolphus - the
   Duke of Cambridge, [98]the Duke of Cumberland (later Ernest Augustus I
   of Hanover), and [99]the Duke of Wellington) at his house in
   [100]Grosvenor Square on [101]23 February 1821. On the same night the
   [102]Cato Street conspirators had designed the murder of the cabinet
   ministers at the house adjoining Harcourt's, where the ministers had
   agreed to dine with [103]Lord Harrowby.^[104][1]

[[105]edit] Harcourt's publications

    1. A Sermon preached before the Lords on the Anniversary of the
       Martyrdom of King Charles the First, 1794.
    2. A Sermon preached before the Society for the Propagation of the
       Gospel, 1798.
    3. A Sermon preached at the Coronation of George IV, 1821, which was
       twice reprinted.
