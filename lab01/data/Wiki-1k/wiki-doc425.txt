   Druk Air Corporation Limited ([22]Dzongkha: , [23]Wylie: 'brug mkha'
   'grul las 'dzin), [24]operating as Drukair - Royal Bhutan Airlines, is
   the [25]national airline of the [26]Kingdom of Bhutan and operates a
   modest scheduled flight network within the [27]South Asian region from
   its [28]base at [29]Paro Airport in the western [30]dzongkhag of
   [31]Paro.

   Taking its name from [32]Druk, the [33]airline was founded in 1981, ten
   years after [34]Druk Gyalpo [35]His Majesty King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck
   gradually began to open up the Kingdom from [36]self-imposed isolation,
   and seven years after welcoming its first foreign visitors. As the
   [37]only airline flying into Bhutan, Druk Air has become a [38]lifeline
   with the outside world for the [39]Bhutanese people, as well as
   supporting emerging inbound [40]tourism and export markets.

[[48]edit] History

   In 1968^[49][3] the [50]Indian Border Roads Organisation built an
   [51]airstrip in the [52]Paro [53]valley, which was initially utilised
   for on call [54]helicopter operations by the [55]Indian Armed Forces
   for the [56]Royal Government of Bhutan. After consideration by King
   [57]Jigme Singye Wangchuck and the [58]Tshogdu, Druk Air was
   established by [59]Royal Charter on 5 April 1981, ^[60][4] ten years
   after [61]Druk Gyalpo [62]His Majesty King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck
   gradually began to open up the Kingdom from [63]self-imposed isolation,
   and seven years after welcoming its first foreign visitors.^[64][5]
   [65]Paro Airport with a Drukair [66]BAe 146 on the [67]apron

   Paro Airport is located deep in a valley 2,235 metres (7,330 ft)
   [68]above sea level, and is surrounded by [69]mountains as high as
   4,900 metres (16,000 ft),^[70][6] with a [71]runway at the time which
   was 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) in length,^[72][4] given which the
   Bhutanese government had specific requirements for a choice of aircraft
   to be operated. They required an 18  20 seat [73]STOL-capable aircraft
   with operating capabilities which included a high [74]service ceiling,
   high [75]rate of climb and high manoeuvrability. The major requirement
   for the aircraft was that it must be capable of flying [76]Kolkata
   [77]Paro  [78]Kolkata, a 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) round-trip flight,
   without refuelling, due to minimal [79]infrastructure being available
   at Paro for this purpose. Three different aircraft types were
   considered after [80]flight tests in India and Bhutan between 1978 and
   1980, however, none were deemed to be suitable.^[81][4]

   In mid  1981, the [82]Indian government set up a [83]committee to study
   its own requirements for a [84]Light Transport Aircraft. Based upon
   this competition, the Bhutanese government ordered one [85]Dornier
   228-200 for delivery in January 1983, with the option for a second
   aircraft for delivery in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200
   landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983, the exact time of landing,
   the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft
   was parked on the [86]airport apron being predetermined by the [87]high
   lama of [88]Paro Dzong.^[89][4]

   The airline inaugurated scheduled revenue flights on 11 February 1983,
   with Flight 101 departing Paro for Kolkata and returning the next day
   as Flight 102. For the first four weeks the flight was operated three
   times a week, after which it was increased to a daily flight.^[90][4]
   At the time of service commencement, Paro Airport consisted of the
   runway, a two-room [91]air traffic control building (with the ground
   floor acting as the [92]check-in counter) and a [93]departure lounge on
   the lawn.^[94][7] Prior to the establishment of the [95]Department of
   Civil Aviation in January 1986, the airline was responsible for the
   operation and maintenance of airport infrastructure.^[96][8] The
   airline commenced flights to [97]Dhaka in [98]Bangladesh on 30 October
   1986.^[99][9]^[100][10]

[[102]edit] Jet Era

   On 31 December 1987, a [104]US$25 million^[105][12] order was placed
   with [106]British Aerospace for a [107]BAe 146-100 [108]STOL
   [109]regional jet.^[110][13] The purchase of the aircraft was financed
   by the government obtaining, for the first time in the country's
   history, a [111]commercial loan.^[112][14]

   In 1988, the operational base was shifted from Kolkata to Paro
   Airport.^[113][9] On 21 November 1988, the BAe 146 was delivered to
   Paro Airport. With the introduction of the BAe 146, Drukair was able to
   widen its network to link Paro with [114]Delhi on 26 November 1988,
   [115]Bangkok on 28 January 1989 and [116]Kathmandu in April
   1989.^[117][10] Drukair also hired its first seven flight attendants in
   1988 who were trained by [118]Thai Airways International.^[119][9] In
   the first full year of operational service with the BAe 146, the
   airline achieved an average [120]load factor of 50  60 percent, more
   than the 40 percent which was expected,^[121][15] carrying 12,732 over
   the 1989  1990 period.^[122][10] In 1990,^[123][16] the runway at Paro
   Airport was lengthened from 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) to 2,000 metres
   (6,600 ft) and reinforced for heavier aircraft,^[124][9] and a
   [125]hangar was also constructed for the aircraft, which was funded by
   the Indian government as part of the Paro Airport Development
   Project.^[126][3]
   Drukair flights between Kathmandu and Paro afford passengers a close
   aerial encounter with [127]Mount Everest^[128][17]

   The airlines only aircraft was [129]requisitioned by [130]Druk Gyalpo
   [131]Jigme Singye Wangchuck on 9 November 1990 in order to allow the
   King and his party to travel to [132]Tokyo for the [133]coronation of
   [134]Akihito as [135]Emperor of Japan.^[136][18] From Japan, the King
   then travelled to [137]Mal in the [138]Maldives for the [139]South
   Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit between 21 November
   23 November, and returned to Bhutan in order for the aircraft to
   re-enter service with the airline on 25 November.^[140][18] Due to a
   requirement stipulated by the Bhutanese government that all foreign
   tourists, with the exception of Indian [141]nationals, enter and leave
   Bhutan by air,^[142][5] the country's tourism industry was brought to a
   halt, which saw the airline paying hefty penalties to disgruntled
   [143]tour operators.^[144][18] This problem was somewhat alleviated
   when a second BAe 146 entered service in 1992.^[145][19]

   On 11 November 1993, Drukair introduced an Executive Class of 10 seats.
   Total passenger capacity was now 72 seats.^[146][9]

   On 11 November 1995, Drukair introduced an inflight magazine, Tashi
   Delek.^[147][9]

   Service to [148]Yangon, the capital of [149]Myanmar, began on 6 January
   1997.^[150][20]

   On 13 May 1991, Drukair was registered under the Companies Act of
   Bhutan.^[151][9]

   Drukair became the launch customer for the [152]Avro RJX-85 in April
   2000 when it placed an order with [153]BAE Systems for two aircraft,
   with deliveries initially scheduled to take place in November 2001 and
   January 2002.^[154][21] Delays in the first flight and
   [155]certification of the RJX pushed back expected delivery to Drukair
   to after April 2002. ^[156][22] BAe Systems cancelled the RJX program
   in November 2002,^[157][23] due to receiving orders from only two
   airlines,^[158][24] Druk Air and [159]British European.^[160][23] With
   British European threatening [161]legal action to [162]enforce their
   contract with BAe Systems,^[163][25] the [164]aircraft manufacturer
   offered to fulfill the contract for Drukair, although airline
   [165]management decided against acquiring the aircraft, citing
   potential problems with sourcing [166]spare parts for the aircraft in
   future.^[167][24]

   In order to find a replacement for the 2 BAe 146s, Drukair management
   fielded submissions from [168]Airbus, [169]Boeing and [170]Embraer to
   determine their products suitability to meet Drukair's stringent
   operational requirements. [171]Bombardier was also invited by
   management to demonstrate the [172]CRJ900 [173]regional jet,^[174][26]
   however, the airline was advised by Bombardier the aircraft would be
   unsuited for operations at Paro.^[175][27] In February 2002, the
   [176]Airbus A319 became the largest aircraft to ever land at Paro
   Airport, when Airbus demonstrated the aircraft to the airline. By
   October, Boeing had withdrawn from the competition due to not being
   able to source an aircraft to demonstrate to the airline. With the
   [177]Embraer E-190 yet to fly, it was expected that Drukair would order
   the A319, however, the government had concerns regarding financing for
   the purchase, and in October the final decision was delayed.^[178][28]
   After a short period of time, the government instructed management to
   begin evaluations once again,^[179][27] and a [180]Boeing 737-700
   conducted eleven [181]test flights at Paro Airport in February 2003 in
   which it was demonstrated it met the requirements of the airline for
   operation into Paro.^[182][29]

   [183]Airbus signed a [184]memorandum of understanding with Drukair in
   July 2003 for two 114-seat^[185][30] [186]Airbus A319-115, powered by
   two [187]CFM56-5B engines,^[188][31] for delivery in the second half of
   2004.^[189][32] The purchase of the two jets, valued at [190]Nu.
   3,534.36 million,^[191][12] was the biggest single purchase ever made
   by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in
   the Bhutanese [192]trade deficit over the previous year for the
   [193]financial year 2004  2005.^[194][33]^[195][34] The Bhutanese
   government issued Nu. 1,767.18 million in [196]government bonds to pay
   for one aircraft^[197][12] and for only the second time in Bhutan's
   history intended to seek a [198]commercial loan for the other
   aircraft,^[199][14] however, in October 2004 it announced it would
   instead seek a [200]soft loan for this purpose.^[201][12]

   On 11 November 2003, the birthday of [202]Druk Gyalpo [203]Jigme Singye
   Wangchuck, Drukair initiated services to [204]Gaya,
   [205]India.^[206][35] [207]Bodh Gaya, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Gaya,
   is the site of the [208]Mahabodhi Temple where [209]Siddhrtha Gautama,
   the [210]Buddha, reached [211]enlightenment, and 30,000  40,000
   Bhutanese make the [212]pilgrimage every year.^[213][36] [214]Pilgrims
   have previously made the pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya via a 2-3 day
   [215]overland trip from the Bhutanese border town of [216]Phuntsholing,
   and Drukair management plans on acquiring 20-30% of this
   traffic,^[217][35]^[218][36] although the airline has yet to record a
   [219]profit on the route.^[220][37] The following month, as a result of
   [221]Royal Bhutan Army efforts to expel from Bhutan territory Indian
   [222]separatist [223]insurgent groups, notably the [224]United
   Liberation Front of Asom and the [225]National Democratic Front of
   Bodoland,^[226][38] flights to [227]Dhaka were suspended from 29
   December^[228][39] in order to prevent insurgents from using Drukair
   flights to escape to alleged hideouts in [229]Bangladesh.^[230][40]

[[231]edit] Airbus

   Passengers disembarking from Drukair's [232]Airbus A319 at [233]Paro
   Airport

   The first [234]Airbus A319 arrived in Bhutan on 19 October
   2004;^[235][30] the date chosen after a Buddhist [236]astrologist was
   consulted to ensure the aircraft arrived in Bhutan on an
   [237]auspicious day in the [238]Buddhist calendar.^[239][12] Before
   entering service on commercial flights on 31 October 2004,^[240][41]
   Drukair took their A319 on a country-wide flight in honour of the
   ascencion of [241]Crown Prince [242]Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck to
   the [243]Chhoetse Penlop.^[244][12] The second aircraft was delivered
   by Airbus to Drukair in December 2004.^[245][42]

   In July 2005, the governments of [246]India and Bhutan signed a new
   [247]Air Services Agreement which increased the allowable number of
   weekly flights between the two countries from twelve to forty-nine. In
   addition to destinations already served by Drukair, the cities of
   [248]Mumbai, [249]Chennai and [250]Guwahati were included in the Air
   Services Agreement, with Bhutan being granted [251]fifth freedom rights
   from several Indian cities to onward destinations such as [252]Yangon,
   [253]Dhaka and [254]Singapore.^[255][43]^[256][44]

   Domestic [257]helicopter service was inaugurated in November
   2005,^[258][45] inline with a [259]resolution by the [260]Council of
   Ministers in April 2001 which stated that domestic services should be
   introduced. Thirty [261]heliports across the country were identified,
   and the introduction of services saw, for example, the 550 kilometres
   (340 mi) trip from [262]Thimphu to [263]Trashigang taking only one
   hour, instead of two  three days.^[264][46] The [265]Eurocopter
   Ecureuil helicopter operated by the [266]Nepalese operator, [267]Air
   Dynasty, had by January 2006 seen 30 hours of service, netting Drukair
   [268]US$3,000 in profits.^[269][45]

   Flights to Dhaka, suspended since 29 December 2003, resumed on 23
   October 2006,^[270][47] and the airline was given rights to fly to
   [271]Chittagong and [272]Cox's Bazar by the [273]Bangladeshi
   authorities.^[274][48] The airline announced plans in July 2007 to
   start scheduled flights to [275]Mumbai via [276]Kathmandu from March
   2008,^[277][49] inline with the [278]strategy of Drukair management to
   increase the number of Indian [279]tourists travelling to Bhutan during
   the low season months of June  August and November  February.^[280][50]
   These plans were put on hold in March 2008, due to Paro Airport not
   being able to handle night flights and the airline only being able to
   secure [281]landing slots at Mumbai's [282]Chhatrapati Shivaji
   International Airport at 3am.^[283][50] Plans for services to [284]Hong
   Kong, [285]Singapore, [286]Abu Dhabi, [287]Dubai and [288]Sharjah were
   also shelved.^[289][50]

   The two BAe 146 aircraft were sold to [290]Star Per in October 2007 for
   a reported [291]US$3.3 million,^[292][51] and left Bhutan for [293]Peru
   in November and December 2007.^[294][52]
   [295]Airbus A319 at [296]Paro Airport

   [297]Druk Gyalpo [298]Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck on 11 November
   2007 issued a [299]Royal Kasho establishing [300]Druk Holding and
   Investments Limited, a [301]holding company which would manage existing
   and future investments of the Royal Bhutanese government. As a result,
   seven [302]government-owned companies, including Drukair, had their
   ownership transferred from the [303]Ministry of Finance to the
   newly-formed holding company.^[304][53]^[305][54] Incorporated on 13
   November 2007, Druk Holding and Investments announced in December 2007
   that given Bhutan's tourism industry being reliant on Drukair, the head
   of the government agency overseeing tourism development in Bhutan would
   become the [306]chairperson of Drukair, and would be responsible for
   improving the performance of the national airline.^[307][55]^[308][56]

   In March 2008, Drukair introduced a new uniform for its [309]flight
   attendants, consisting of a contemporary [310]kira and tego.^[311][57]
   The uniforms were introduced for the [312]centenary celebrations of the
   [313]monarchy in Bhutan and the airlines own [314]silver
   jubilee,^[315][19] and was chosen by way of a competition in which five
   Bhutanese [316]fashion designers submitted entries, with the winning
   entry receiving a [317]Nu. 75,000 prize.^[318][57] The [319]textile was
   chosen by way of a competition jointly organised by Druk Air and the
   [320]United Nations Development Programme to promote the Bhutanese
   [321]textile industry and [322]culture of Bhutan.^[323][58]^[324][59]

   Although the government of Bhutan goes to great lengths to prevent
   outside influences from intruding on [325]Bhutanese culture, Drukair is
   not immune to problems which affect the [326]airline industry and the
   [327]world community at large. In June 2008, citing [328]hikes in the
   price of oil and the need to contain [329]operational costs, the
   airline reduced [330]frequencies across its network and announced an
   increase in [331]airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking
   advantage of the lower cost of [332]jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and
   Bangkok airports.^[333][60] Due to its small network which is reliant
   on [334]fifth-freedom rights^[335][61], Drukair regularly [336]leases
   its aircraft to other airlines, such as [337]Myanmar Airways
   International, [338]Indian Airlines and [339]Bangkok Airways in order
   to keep [340]utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would
   under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra
   [341]revenue.^[342][62]^[343][63]^[344][61]

   As the [345]only airline flying into Bhutan, Druk Air has become a
   [346]lifeline with the outside world for the [347]Bhutanese
   people,^[348][61] as well as supporting emerging inbound [349]tourism
   and export markets.^[350][64] The airline has in recent times been
   criticised for its unreliability, particularly from the Bhutanese
   tourism industry which is still in its infancy, and regards the very
   company upon which it relies as its biggest threat.^[351][64]

   The [352]Indian government is conducting a [353]feasibility study for
   the Bhutanese government into the viability of an [354]international
   airport near the southern Bhutanese town of [355]Gelephu.^[356][43] In
   the tenth [357]five-year plan, which covers 2008  2013, the amount of
   Nu. 2,826 million has been allocated by the Bhutan government for
   development of the airport as per the [358]master plan.^[359][65] A
   preliminary [360]survey was conducted by the [361]Indians in May 2006
   and the survey team from the [362]Airports Authority of India was to
   return to complete the final survey in September, however, after
   repeated requests from the Bhutanese the surveying team has yet to
   return, thereby delaying any potential development of the all-weather
   airport.^[363][49]

   The airline has announced its intention to join the [364]International
   Air Transport Association in 2009.^[365][66]
