   (1998)

   Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp was [23]Kid Rock's third full length album,
   It was distributed by his own label, Top Dog Records. There are two
   pressings of this CD, the first, the 1996 original pressing, has the
   Top Dog logo on the actual CD while the 1999 reissue it just a basic
   labeled disc. Kid Rock used the money he made from his 1994/1995
   monthly Bootleg Series cassettes as well as becoming the janitor at The
   White Room Studios to purchase recording time. "Intro" has been used by
   the Detroit Red Wings and Pistons at their games. This album is not
   backed musically by The Twisted Brown Trucker Band as many report. He
   did not start arranging the group into a full-fledged backing band
   until he began pushing for major label attention in 1997.There are 3
   different alternate covers for the cassette release. The 1st is
   commonly known as the "blurry" version. There is also a "Joe C" version
   and a very rare "CD cover" cassette as well. Kid Rock sold a green
   label pressing of the album in concert in 1999.The songs "Where U At
   Rock" and "Black Chick, White Guy" were remade for his Devil Without A
   Cause release. While "Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp", "Paid", "I Wanna Go
   Back", and "Ya Keep On" were completely rerecorded for the History of
   Rock album with additional samples, piano parts, and guitar parts.
