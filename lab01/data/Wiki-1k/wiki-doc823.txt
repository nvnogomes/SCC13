   Ed, Edd n Eddy is an original [25]animated television series on
   [26]Cartoon Network, created by [27]Danny Antonucci and produced by
   Canadian based [28]a.k.a. Cartoon. Ed, Edd n Eddy is currently Cartoon
   Network's longest running series^[[29]citation needed], and the only
   currently running [30]Cartoon Cartoons series. The show aired for five
   seasons on the network. The series revolves around three
   [31]preadolescent boys collectively known as "the Eds," who hang around
   in a [32]suburban [33]cul-de-sac. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds
   constantly scheme to make money off their peers, but their plans
   usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments.

[[49]edit] Overview

   Ed, Edd n Eddy was animated wholly using traditional [50]cel animation
   up until its fourth season. Though the show is still entirely
   hand-drawn, all cels are colored digitally as are most other series. It
   is the last major cartoon to use painted cels.^[[51]citation needed]
   The cels are shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and
   then later edited back at a.k.a. To give the impression of movement,
   Ed, Edd n Eddy uses shimmering character outlines similar to
   [52]Squigglevision.^[[53]citation needed] The crawling lines are not
   nearly as active as those in [54]Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, but
   are still visible.^[55][1] Much of the unfavorable press that Ed, Edd n
   Eddy received has been because of this animation technique.^[56][2]
   However, Danny Antonucci calls it a "wobble", and likens it to cartoons
   of the 1930s where the film tended to be unstable and cause a similar
   effect.^[57][3]

   There is a strong theme of vagueness in the series,^[[58]citation
   needed] including the setting and deeper facts about the children. The
   show revolves solely around the Eds, the other cul-de-sac children, and
   the Kanker sisters.^[59][3] There are no hints as to where the cartoon
   takes place. Little is known about any other people in the town and if
   they even have any type of relation to the regular characters of the
   series, other than the fact that Ed is Sarah's older brother.

   The show frequently makes [60]meta-references and often breaks the
   [61]fourth wall. Almost every episode contains references to [62]pop
   culture, especially movies. An example would be a reference to [63]The
   Shining: In one episode, Eddy says to Rolf: "Hey, Stretch! All work and
   no play makes Jack a dull boy!"^[[64]citation needed] All the episode
   titles, except for the holiday specials, are popular sayings with a
   word replaced with the word Ed (for example, "Stop, Look, and Ed":
   Stop, Look, and Listen.) Some are also parodies of movie titles (e.g.,
   the episode "For Your Ed Only" would be [65]For Your Eyes Only). In
   addition, the letters AKA, the abbreviation for the name of the company
   that produces the show (a.k.a. Cartoon), frequently appear in the show
   on license plates, magazines, T-shirts, etc.^[[66]citation needed] The
   kids have multi-colored tongues, because, as Danny Antonucci stated,
   kids are almost always eating something that turn their tongues
   different colors.^[67][3] Most of the episodes begin with something
   completely unrelated to the storyline of the episode; this is to
   emphasize the spontaneity of childhood.^[68][3] The number of
   characters in Ed, Edd n Eddy is fixed at twelve. No other characters
   have appeared besides the main cast and [69]adults are never seen.
   There is no given timeline for the show; Danny Antonucci has stated
   that he wanted the show to appeal to any generation.^[[70]citation
   needed]

[[71]edit] Characters

          Main article: [72]List of characters in Ed, Edd n Eddy

   According to an interview with Danny Antonucci (a special feature on
   the Season 1 DVD set), the characters were based on real people in his
   life. The personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on personal
   traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons. The cul-de-sac
   kids were based on kids he grew up with. Antonucci also stated that he
   believed it was important to add Plank to the show, stating that he
   "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a
   character of his own" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually
   never do.^[73][4] He also stated that Rolf is strongly based on himself
   and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up
   in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways
   of living, compared to those born in Canada.^[74][3] In a Cartoon
   Network podcast interview, Antonucci hinted at the Kanker sisters being
   based on someone from his personal life, as well.

[[84]edit] Video games

   There are three [85]video games based on the series. [86]Ed, Edd n
   Eddy: Jawbreakers! was released on September 15, 2002^[87][5] for the
   [88]Game Boy Advance. [89]Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures was
   released on October 31, 2005 for the [90]Nintendo GameCube,
   [91]PlayStation 2, [92]Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and the [93]PC. Most
   recently Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century was released for the
   [94]Nintendo DS on October 26, 2007. Additionally, characters and
   locations from the show make appearances in Cartoon Network based video
   games. The cul-de-sac is featured in the game [95]Cartoon Network:
   Block Party, where Eddy and Sarah are playable characters. The Eds and
   Jonny appeared in [96]Cartoon Network Speedway as playable characters.

   [97]Scam of the Century is in the action category, and was developed by
   the lesser-known gaming company [98]D3 Publisher.^[99][6] The original
   storyline is developed around Eddy losing his precious Who to Scam and
   When book. When the three friends realize their classmate Kevin has the
   book in his hands and an angry mob of kids has developed, they run for
   the woods. Splitting up to throw off the crowd, they plan to meet up
   back at the cul-de-sac. Several adventures in the game await them. When
   they make their way back at the cul-de-sac, they find that Rolf has
   built a giant fort to keep them out. The game features 13 total stages,
   special attacks using the touch screen, the option to blow into the
   microphone to bring characters back to life, three side story
   mini-games and special items.

   All three Eds have been confirmed as [100]NPCs in the upcoming
   [101]MMOG [102]Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall. Their artwork for
   the game is viewable on the game's main website. Their appearance as
   Nanos -- items that help the user or his/her party -- (besides Eddy's)
   has yet to be confirmed. ^[103][7]

[[117]edit] Critical reaction

   The reaction to Ed, Edd n Eddy is varied. Terrence Briggs of
   [118]Animation World Magazine argued that every second of the show is
   "filler" and that the main characters are drawn as "products from the
   school of acid-trip caricature."^[119][2] After the review was
   published, support letters of the show started to pile up at Animation
   World Magazine's website. This caused the magazine write a more
   positive review of Ed, Edd n Eddy, calling it a "fresh show with very
   different approaches."^[120][1]

   [121]Film critic Maryann Johanson found the show a successful
   experiment in style but surprisingly infantile in content, opining:
   "Visually, Cartoon Network's kiddie entry Ed, Edd n Eddy is
   delightfully gonzo, its inventive animation style and garish colors
   reflecting the adolescent confusion of its identically named boy
   heroes. But their goofy misadventures hold little appeal for grownup
   cartoon fans -- this one is pretty much strictly for the
   kiddies."^[122][8] David Cornelius considered the Eds adolescent
   equivalents of the [123]Three Stooges,^[124][9] believing: "The series
   revels in the sort of frantic, often [125]gross humor kids love so
   much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults
   giggle just as easily."^[126][9] Cornelius also concurred that the
   "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming
   the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze.
   This is animation that's, well, really animated."^[127][9]

[[128]edit] Other works

   Ed, Edd and Eddy look-alikes in Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.

   There have been other produced works in which the Eds would appear than
   just their regular series airings. They have appeared in a
   [129]Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends episode using Foster's styled
   animation, and made a short [130]cameo in The Grim Adventures of the
   Kids Next Door. Also, they appeared in a small crossover entitled Ed,
   Edd n Mandy.

[[131]edit] Shorts

   Cartoon Network has also produced shorts, some involving the Eds during
   commercial breaks. For a short while, Cartoon Network made a series of
   roughly 2-minute shorts called Ed, Edd, y Eduardo in which Eduardo from
   Foster's appeared in an Ed, Edd n Eddy episode.^[[132]citation needed]
   These shorts began airing on July 11, 2006 on Cartoon Network. There
   was also a short music video with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy
   and Sarah, entitled "The Incredible Shrinking Day", which aired on
   Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video Sarah uses a [133]potion
   to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her [134]dollhouse,
   with predictable results. Plank starred in a similar video called "My
   Best Friend Plank," which aired in 2002.^[[135]citation needed]

[[136]edit] Special events

   There have been many specials in which Cartoon Network would run all
   day marathons for either a promotion or just a special airing for one
   of their shows. A marathon called The Best Day Edder aired from April
   27 to April 28, 2007, in which every episode was shown in chronological
   order, ending with the previously unaired last episode of Season 5.

   A special episode of Ed, Edd n Eddy aired on May 11, 2007 in the
   Cartoon Network event, [137]Invaded, in which aliens invade Rolf's
   house. This alien invasion is in adjunct with the other Cartoon Network
   series [138]Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, [139]My Gym Partner's
   a Monkey, [140]Camp Lazlo, and [141]The Grim Adventures of Billy &
   Mandy. The episode is part a mini-series that aired all 5 specials on
   May 28, 2007.

[[142]edit] The Future

   A.k.a. Cartoon conducted a panel on July 26, 2007 at [143]San Diego
   [144]Comic-Con and provided the following information about the future
   of the series: There will not be a full sixth season of the series at
   this time since the crew chose to put their time into making a movie
   instead; the movie is tentatively titled Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture
   Show, and the plot will focus on the Eds searching for Eddy's
   brother.^[145][10]
