[[30]edit] Upfront game

[[31]edit] Buzzers

     * Cactus Buzzers - Contestants must answer questions by pressing a
       small hand buzzer surrounded by cacti. Halfway through the game,
       the players are blindfolded and the turntables holding the cacti
       and buzzers begin to rotate.
     * Pissing Buzzers - Contestants are seated on specially designed
       [32]toilets, with only a small door on the stall for privacy. To
       answer a question, a contestant must "do a little wee" to activate
       his or her buzzer.
     * Butt Buzzers - The contestants were lined up side by side, and wore
       gold go-go shorts with buzzers attached to their rear ends. To
       answer a question, the contestant had to slap the buzzer located on
       his neighbor's bottom. Halfway through the round, contestants
       switch places in order to force them to slap opponents of the same
       sex, rather than their original ones of the opposite sex.
     * Shots - To answer a question, contestants must down a shot of an
       extremely hot [33]sauce, freezing cold [34]slush (to cause "brain
       freeze"), their own [35]urine. As the drinking game is usually the
       head-to-head contest in Great Britain, the final shot is usually
       the rest of the cup or the other contestant's urine.
     * Catapult Buzzers - To buzz in, contestants must pull a lever which
       in turn launches a cream [36]pie into the player's face. After the
       contestant has used up the pie, it is replaced with other random
       food items ([37]ketchup, [38]mustard, [39]guacamole, raw [40]eggs,
       [41]honey, fruit [42]pies, [43]jelly, [44]pudding, or [45]rice.)
       Incidentally, the contestants are dressed in their regular clothes
       for this round, and while they may clean off their faces, they must
       "wear" the food on their clothes and in their hair for the
       remainder of the show.
     * Eggs - To answer, a player must smash an egg on their forehead,
       most of which are raw; however, some of the eggs are hard-boiled
       and a few are fertilized. Again, contestants compete in their
       regular clothes in this round, and compete in their messy attire
       for the remainder of the show.
     * Stunt Bottles - To buzz in, a contestant must break an empty stunt
       bottle on his or her own head. In the second half of the round, the
       player must break a bottle on the head of the other contestant of
       the same sex before answering.
     * Hammerheads - Contestants have buzzers attached to their heads, and
       activate them by jumping on a [46]trampoline and hitting the buzzer
       on a second trampoline suspended over them.
     * Wax On, Wax Off - Contestants are covered in sugar wax and strips
       of paper stuck; whenever a player buzzes in, the distractor rips a
       strip of paper off of that contestant.
     * Slapstick - Contestants are placed at a table with their faces in a
       chin rest; meanwhile distractors hidden under the table have their
       hands protruding from holes directly in front of the contestants.
       Whenever someone buzzes in, he or she is slapped in the face by the
       concealed distractor.
     * Geometric Geniuses - Contestants have a ruler attached to each side
       of their heads with rubber bands, and buzz in by pulling on a ruler
       and snapping the person next to them. The questions usually have
       something to do with math.
     * Fans - Contestants must buzz in to answer questions by stopping the
       blades of [47]table fans with their faces.
     * Bar Fight - Every time a contestant buzzes in, a stuntman breaks
       stunt glass over the person's head. As a contestant uses up the
       glass objects, they are replaced by larger ones, from a beer bottle
       to a vase; if a contestant buzzes in an unusually high number of
       times, eventually stunt chairs are broken across that player's
       back.
     * Electrocution - Contestants must put [48]dog collars around their
       necks. In the first half of the round, they get electrocuted every
       time they buzz in; in the second half, they get electrocuted
       randomly.
     * Rubber Bands/Clothespins - Contestants simultaneously put as many
       [49]rubber bands or [50]clothespins around or on their face while
       answering questions. The contestant with the most rubber bands or
       clothespins on his or her head gets an additional five points.
     * Honey and Feather - Contestants are covered in honey first, then
       enter a booth, when they buzz in, a fan will turn on sending
       feathers cycling around the contestant

[[51]edit] Timed events

     * Wrestlers - Each contestant is thrown around and manhandled by
       professional wrestlers (some of which have included [52]Samoa Joe,
       [53]Curry Man, [54]Sylvester Terkay and [55]Frankie Kazarian) for
       45 seconds while trying to answer questions. Other variations on
       this challenge include answering while being manhandled by
       [56]attack dogs, wrapped in a gym mat and assaulted by
       [57]kickboxers, and having one's head stuck in a box containing
       [58]pigeons.
     * Ping Pong - Each contestant must stick his or her head through a
       hole in a modified [59]Ping Pong table, and is asked questions for
       45 seconds while two ball launchers simultaneously fire Ping Pong
       balls at the player's face at a rate of 96 per minute and a speed
       of 60 miles per hour.
     * Roller Derby - The contestant must stay in a tiny square and defend
       against six roller girls as they attempt to shove the player out of
       the square and attach flags to him or her. Whoever receives the
       fewest flags receives a 5 point bonus.
     * Continuing Distractions - The three contestants simultaneously
       compete in a timed round and buzz in with regular buzzers; however,
       a distraction is continually taking place on or near the
       contestant. Examples include:
          + The contestants being covered in [60]corn while live [61]geese
            feed off their bodies
          + The players having to lie down (sometimes with cheek
            extractors in their mouths) underneath a cage full of live
            [62]pigeons while said birds defecate on them
          + Having [63]snakes and [64]maggots put down the contestants'
            shorts
          + Having scantily clad women stand behind the contestants
            scraping their fingernails on [65]chalkboards.
          + Having professional [66]acupuncture therapists stick needles
            into the contestants' faces.

[[67]edit] Events featuring [68]nudists

     * Nudist Relay - Taking place in the second round, the three
       remaining players do not answer questions, but instead compete in a
       relay race, featuring the wheelbarrow, the three-legged race, the
       sack race, and leapfrog (or "under the bridge"). The last place
       finisher is eliminated.
     * Nudist Dressing - A bunch of nudists come out and make three lanes.
       Each contestant is instructed to pick a lane. They must go through
       all the nudists' legs in that lane on their back to find a bin with
       shirts. Then, they must put a shirt on each nudist. Then, they will
       go through the lane again and get another bin with underwear, then
       vests. They go as far as they can until time runs out. The
       contestants who have gotten the furthest with dressing the nudists
       move on.
     * Nudist Turntable - Players must find the answers on cards stuck to
       the bodies of nudists on rotating platforms, take them off with
       their teeth, bring back the card, and put it on the board.
       Successfully doing so scores a [69]point. In the first or second
       round, the player with the lowest score at the end is eliminated;
       in the third round, the first contestant to get 4 points wins the
       game. To make finding the answers more difficult, the players must
       wear specially-designed glasses to blur their vision.
     * Nudist Phone Booth - The remaining two contestants each stand in
       phone booths. Every time one of them answers a question correctly,
       an unattractive (usually elderly) nudist joins them in the phone
       booth. First person to get four (sometimes five) nudists in their
       booth wins.

[[70]edit] Other events

     * Blinking Electrocution (also referred to as Eyes Wide Open) -
       Contestants answer questions while seated in chairs with their arms
       locked down, and with a TV screen above their heads with their eyes
       pictured on the screen. They are hooked up to [71]electrodes and
       get electrocuted every time their eyes blink. In the middle of the
       round, Jimmy brings back distractors from a previous round. To
       cause the contestants to blink more, they smoke cigars and blow out
       the smoke in the contestants' eyes.
     * Bubble Bust - Contestants have cheek extractors placed into their
       mouths to make it hard to talk and to cause mild discomfort. They
       are strapped to a chair facing a television that is showing
       well-known celebrities, and must guess the personality appearing on
       the screen. However, while they are doing this, a bubble machine
       blows 100 bubbles in their face per second, causing the contestants
       to blink and making it difficult to see the screen, as well as
       causing them to inhale the bubbles since they cannot close their
       mouths.
     * Lamb's Testicles - Players must put a [72]lamb's [73]testicle in
       their mouth for each question they answer correctly and on the 5th
       question they must eat the testicle. Another version of this game
       involved live [74]maggots.
     * Bed of Nails - Always a head-to-head round, contestants answer
       questions while lying on a [75]bed of nails. Each player is given a
       [76]cinder block to hold across his or her stomach; every time a
       player gives a correct answer, a [77]carnival worker smashes the
       cinder block with a [78]sledgehammer. The first contestant to get
       four correct answers wins the game.
     * Pig Pen - Contestants are placed in a pen with greased [79]pigs
       labeled from 1 to 5. To answer a question, the player (whose arms
       are greased as well) must pick up a pig and hold it above his
       waist. If he answers correctly, he receives points according to the
       number painted on the pig.
     * Bad Dancers - Contestants have to guess songs playing while fat
       dancers wearing nearly revealing clothing and holding iPods dance
       horribly while the song is playing.
     * Piercing Parade - After each correct answer, a piercer will pierce
       the contestant in the ear, navel, nipple, eyebrows, nose, or
       "Safety Place" (wherever the contestant wants it). 4 correct
       answers wins the game.
     * Tattoos - The final two contestants each answer questions while
       being [80]tattooed by professional artists. The first contestant to
       answer four questions gets his or her tattoo completed after the
       show; the loser goes home with a half-finished tattoo.
     * Balloons - Two contestants are naked down to socks and five
       [81]balloons covering their genitals and buttocks. A balloon is
       popped each time a contestant correctly answers a question; first
       contestant to have all his/her balloons popped wins.
     * Paintballs - A face-to-face round in which a [82]paintball player
       fires paintballs at a contestant, anywhere the host dictates, when
       that player incorrectly answers a question or the opponent
       correctly answers a question.
     * Volleyball/hockey - A face-to-face round in which contestants are
       hit with a volleyball or hockey puck (by professional athletes in
       their respective sports) when they buzz in.
     * Tickling - Contestants are hung upside-down barefoot, and are asked
       questions while the soles of their feet are tickled by two women or
       a guest presenter.
     * Hole in the Wall - Played in Italy, the game is just like the
       Japanese Game Show "Human Tetris" where the remaining contestants
       have to go through a foam wall with a shape on it, whoever passes
       the least amount of walls are eliminated

[[83]edit] Prize rounds

[[84]edit] Driven To Distraction

   UK, US season 1, Italy

   The player won a car (usually a [85]Ford Mustang, [86]Mazda3, [87]Ford
   Ranger, [88]MINI Cooper, or a [89]Volkswagen Beetle), and faced four or
   five questions. Each incorrectly answered question corresponded to a
   specific part of the car being damaged:
     * The windshield being caved in with a sledgehammer
     * Cans of paint poured on the roof, hood, or down the sides of the
       car
     * Smashed headlights or side view mirrors
     * Words scratched on the car door with the keys to that car
     * [90]Graffiti being sprayed down the side of the car (In the UK,
       this has happened to every single car won)
     * A [91]paint grenade previously placed inside the car being
       detonated
     * [92]Paintballs being fired at the car by all losing contestants
     * The hood of the car being attacked with a [93]belt sander
     * The roof of the car being sawn off by a metal [94]jigsaw, turning
       the car into an (albeit unsafe) "convertible"
     * The seats in the car being slashed

   In the UK, the [95]vandalism was usually done by either the losing
   contestants, one of the winner's loved ones, children (for paint), or
   "professional vandals"; however, occasionally the remaining contestant
   was forced to attack the car him/herself. In the US, the damage was
   always carried out by the losing contestants, with one exception: in
   one episode, at the end of the questions, every incorrect answer
   allowed a big burly man with a sledgehammer five seconds to damage the
   car as much as he could. (Incidentally, that was the only time in the
   first season that a player won an undamaged car.)

   After all the questions were asked, the player received the car in
   whatever condition it was in, damaged or not.

[[96]edit] Burning Money

   One version of this game involved the contestant winning a pile of
   money (usually 5000); answering a question incorrectly resulted in part
   of this money being thrown onto a wildly-flaming barbecue until the end
   of the round, when the contestant was allowed to attempt to salvage any
   money that had not been consumed by the flames.

   A variation of this game involved [97]toasters. Each 1000 was lit from
   the start, and every question correctly answered allowed the contestant
   to free money from a toaster. Incorrect answers left the money in the
   toaster until the game ended. This variation of the game was never used
   in the United States edition, as burning money is technically illegal
   in the United States.

[[98]edit] Hot Prizes

   The winning contestant is shown three or four prizes (usually totaling
   5,000 or more in value) sitting next to a lit [99]fireplace. Each
   question is for a specific prize; if the contestant answers the
   question wrong, said prize is shoved into the furnace and burned. If a
   prize proves difficult to burn, [100]gasoline is poured onto it to
   speed up the process; this has caused minor burns to a distractor on at
   least one occasion. Variations on this round have included throwing the
   prizes into a running [101]concrete mixer, and having "carpenters"
   destroy said prizes by "making other items out of them" (such as a
   "bookshelf" out of a stereo, a "picture frame" out of a flat-screen TV,
   etc.)

[[102]edit] Prize Plunge

   The player was shown five prizes (usually totaling $10,000 or more in
   value) in a [103]bulletproof glass box, each of which was hooked up to
   [104]explosives. The contestant faced four or five questions. For each
   question answered incorrectly, the player had to push one of five
   detonators, each of which would randomly trigger one of the explosives.
   At the end, the player won whatever had not been blown up. The prizes
   usually included a [105]Vespa scooter, a [106]computer of some sort, a
   [107]plasma TV, and a smaller electronic device. One of the five prizes
   was usually a stereotypical game show parting gift, such as a supply of
   [108]Rice-A-Roni or a can of peas. This [109]booby prize allowed for a
   1-in-5 chance of getting one question wrong and still walking away with
   all "valuable" prizes intact.

[[110]edit] Car Smash

   (Also referred to as "60 Seconds of Destruction")

   The contestant was awarded a car, and as in the first season, he or she
   had to answer questions to protect it from [111]vandalism. However,
   instead of each question being worth a part of the car, the round was
   now timed. The host asked the player three questions, which usually had
   multiple answers. After the first question was asked, a 60-second clock
   started. For the first 20 seconds, no damage was done to the car.
   However, once the pointer passed 20 and went into the "red zone", a
   bell sounded, and the first loser sprayed [112]graffiti down the
   driver's side of the car (generally, a message making fun of one of the
   winning contestant's "quirks"). A second bell sounded, and the next
   loser ruined the paint job on the hood with a sander. Finally, a third
   bell sounded, and the remaining loser smashed the windshield with a
   [113]sledgehammer. The player could pass; however, the losing players
   only stopped attacking the car when the winning contestant had
   completely answered all three questions or when the 60 seconds expired.
   One undamaged car was given away this season after a contestant
   answered all three questions in 22 seconds (the player with the spray
   paint did not make it to the car in time to start using it and was
   subsequently told not to do anything.)

[[114]edit] Barrel Drop/Conveyor Belt

   The player was shown a desktop computer (either an [115]iMac G5 or a
   [116]Sony [117]VAIO), a large [118]Sony [119]Wega [120]HDTV, and a
   [121]Vespa Scooter. Carr asked the player three (usually
   multiple-answer) questions, each corresponding to a given prize. The
   player had as many guesses as he could give in 10 seconds to completely
   answer the question. If he or she ran out of time, the prize was
   destroyed. The player won the prizes in whatever condition they were in
   after all three questions were asked.

   Barrel Drop version: A steel [122]barrel filled with 1,000 pounds of
   [123]concrete was suspended over the prize, and was slowly raised while
   time elapsed. If time ran out, the barrel was dropped onto the prize.

   Conveyor Belt version: The prize was slowly carried by a [124]conveyor
   belt toward a large red "X". When the prize approached a red light just
   short of the "X", a warning buzzer sounded, and if it reached the
   crosshairs of the "X", a [125]wrecking ball immediately swung down and
   crashed into the prize.

[[126]edit] Rope Burn

   Each of three or four prizes was placed under an [127]anvil suspended
   by a rope attached to a device reminiscent of a [128]Rube Goldberg
   contraption. The contestant had 20 seconds to answer as many questions
   as there were prizes. If the contestant did not answer all the
   questions in the allotted time, a [129]blowtorch aimed at the first
   rope was ignited. The rope in turn burned, allowing the anvil to fall
   onto the prize and destroy it. The remaining torches were lit in 10 or
   15 second intervals, depending on the number of prizes. As soon as all
   questions were answered correctly, any lit torches were extinguished,
   and the contestant won the prizes in whatever condition they were in at
   that point. (This is the only prize round where a contestant could
   still lose all of his or her prizes even if some of the questions were
   answered correctly.)

[[130]edit] Notes

     * Two contestants in the US version have won cars in perfect
       condition (one in each season). One contestant has won a prize
       round with no prizes being damaged (playing 3-prize Rope Burn).
       Three contestants have had all their prizes destroyed (one playing
       Prize Plunge, another playing Barrel Drop, and a third playing
       4-prize Rope Burn.)
     * The timed car round was played five times in the second season. The
       three rounds in which a [131]Ford Mustang was featured all resulted
       in the car receiving the maximum damage possible, as the minute ran
       out before the contestant could answer all three questions. The two
       final rounds that featured a [132]Volkswagen Beetle each had more
       successful contestants - one who only received two letters
       spraypainted onto the side of her car before getting the third
       question right, and the contestant mentioned above who won his car
       untouched [133][1].
