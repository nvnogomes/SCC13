[[26]edit] Characters

   Whether by artistic design or to avoid copyright infringement, names
   from the comic strip have been changed.
     * The main character here as in the strip is [27]Charlie Brown, now
       called C.B.
     * His sister [28]Sally is called simply 'CB's Sister.'
     * [29]Pig-Pen is now called Matt, a pathological neat-freak (he
       applies a layer of [30]Purell to his hands whenever he touches
       anyone) whose dirtiness has been internalized - he's sex-obsessed
       and homophobic.
     * Beethoven (who is based on '[31]Schroeder') became the school
       outcast prior to events in the play when it was revealed that he
       was sexually-abused by his father.
     * Tricia York ([32]Peppermint Patty) and [33]Marcy are a pair of
       partying "mean girls".
     * [34]Linus (called 'Van') always the philosopher in childhood is now
       a pothead.
     * 'Van's Sister' ([35]Lucy) is a pyromaniac and has been
       institutionalized for setting the [36]Little Red-Haired Girl's hair
       on fire.

[[37]edit] Synopsis

   When CB's dog dies from rabies, he begins to contemplate what happens
   after we die. His best friend Van is too burnt out to provide any
   coherent speculation; his sister has gone goth; his ex-girlfriend
   (Van's Sister) has been recently institutionalized; and his other
   friends, Marcy and Tricia are too inebriated and self-involved to give
   him any sort of solace.

   Re-establishing a relationship with his childhood friend, Beethoven -
   who may or may not be gay - CB upsets the balance in his clique of
   friends that ends in horrible violence. Drug use, suicide, eating
   disorders, teen violence, rebellion and sexual identity are among the
   issues covered in this drama.

   [40]United Features Syndicate or the estate of [41]Charles M. Schulz in

   avoid legal entanglement.

   harass".^[75][3]^[76][4]

   sell out audiences in march 2008. The production produced by Vertigo
