   [26]WYSIWYG
   (2000) Readymades
   (2002) [27]Un
   (2004)

   Readymades is [28]Chumbawamba's first release on their own label
   [29]MUTT. It continues the ecclectic mix of techno, rock and folk of
   their former albums, albiet to a less ambitious scale than [30]WYSIWYG.
   It also features vocal samples from contemporary and traditional
   [31]folk artists, some of whom Chumbawamba would go on to work with in
   the future.

   A special version of the album, Readymades And Then Some was released
   in 2003. It came with bonus track/peace anthem "Jacob's Ladder (Not in
   My Name)" and a bonus [32]DVD.

[[52]edit] Album Detail

   "When we decided to mimic Moby's sampling of traditional black American
   blues singers on his album Play, we turned to British folk music and
   its great voices. Kate Rusby, Dick Gaughan, Coope, Boyes & Simpson,
   Harry Cox. Our album Readymades was put together in a skewed homage to
   some of those voices. We half expected criticism from the folk world
   for messing around with the music, but found that the folk audience is
   assuredly open to change and diversity. Since then - even in the last
   four or five years - the modern folk voices and players have multiplied
   and expanded, folkies are looking younger and cooler and there are
   loads of new folk albums out every month. Good or bad, the music's
   often inspiring and exciting. That there's still a radical voice in
   folk music (and especially in its audience) makes it easy for us to
   write and play the way we're doing right now. Trying to be part of a
   radical tradition that, for us, encompasses our own histories (mostly
   northern working towns, The Beatles and punk rock!) and the history of
   rebel songs in the places we've lived." (description from [53]here).
