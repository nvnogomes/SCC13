   Edwin Stephen Campion Vaughan [13]MC ([14]30 November [15]18971931) was
   a [16]British Army officer in the [17]First World War whose diary later
   became a well-known book.

   He was born at Forest Gate of a large [18]Roman Catholic family and
   educated at the Jesuit College of [19]St. Ignatius, [20]Stamford Hill.
   In 1915, he joined the [21]Artists' Rifles [22]Officers' Training Corps
   and was trained at Hare Hall camp, [23]Gidea Park, [24]Essex, at the
   same time as the poets [25]Wilfred Owen and [26]Edward Thomas, but
   there is no record of them having ever met. Vaughan was then
   commissioned into the [27]Royal Warwickshire Regiment on [28]19 June
   [29]1916 as a [30]Junior Lieutenant and sailed for France in January
   1917. A fellow officer named Syd Pepper, who had seen action on the
   Somme in 1916, had convinced Vaughan to sign up for the 1/8th Warwicks,
   and he just managed to get in since there was one vacancy left.
   (January 8 journal entry)

   During the [31]Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle
   of Ypres) in August and September 1917 he kept a diary of his
   experiences with [32]trench warfare. He was temporary [33]Captain of
   his [34]Company for a very short time ( a few hours) while his
   commanding officer was wounded, until a new Company commander came up
   to the line. Vaughan was promoted to permanent rank of Captain in
   October 1917 and he later fought in the Italian campaign. In 1918 he
   returned to France where as a result of his heroics in capturing the a
   bridge over the Sambre Canal, Vaughan was awarded the Military Cross
   for bravery.

   After the war, he tried to settle down in a civilian life, without much
   success. In 1920 he transferred to a [35]Territorial Army battalion of
   the [36]Essex Regiment. In 1922 he was commissioned into the [37]Royal
   Air Force, qualifying as a pilot. He achieved the rank of Flight
   Lieutenant in 1928, but was retired due to ill health. He died in
   hospital in 1931, tragically the victim of a doctor's error in the
   administration of drugs, accidentally given [38]cocaine instead of
   [39]Procaine (Novocaine). He left a widow and four children.

   After E. C. Vaughans death in 1931, one of his brothers hid the diary
   away in a cupboard, which is where it was found four decades later. The
   diary was published in 1981. Writing in the Wall Street Journal in
   2006, James J. Cramer cites "[40]Some Desperate Glory" as one of the
   five best books on war: Vaughan describes the screams of the wounded
   who had sought refuge in the freshly gouged holes only to find
   themselves slowly drowning as rain fell and the water level rose. A
   relentlessly stark account of the war's bloodiest, most futile battle.

   Vaughan ended his diary on August 28, reflecting on the futility of
   Ypres with: " So this was the end of 'D' Company. Feeling sick and
   lonely, I returned to my tent to write out my casualty report; but
   instead I sat on the floor and drank whisky after whisky as I gazed
   into a black and empty future."^[41][1]
