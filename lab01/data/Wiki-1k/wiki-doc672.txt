   Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (ET:QW) is a [71]first-person shooter
   [72]video game, and is the follow-up to [73]Wolfenstein: Enemy
   Territory. However, it is set in the same [74]science fiction universe
   as [75]Quake II and [76]Quake 4, with a minimal back-story serving as a
   prequel to Quake II. It is the second multiplayer-focused game in the
   Quake series (after [77]Quake III Arena). Quake Wars features similar
   gameplay to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but with the addition of
   controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI
   deployables,^[78][7] asymmetric teams, much larger maps and the option
   of computer-controlled [79]bots. Unlike the previous Enemy Territory
   game, Quake Wars is a commercial release rather than a free download.

   Enemy Territory: Quake Wars was developed by [80]Splash Damage for
   [81]Windows using a modified version of [82]id Software's [83]Doom 3
   engine with [84]MegaTexture rendering technology.

   It was announced on February 13, 2007 that Enemy Territory: Quake Wars
   is released for the [85]Xbox 360 and [86]PlayStation 3 in May 27],
   2008.^[87][8] On May 21, 2007, it was announced that [88]Aspyr Media
   would be releasing the title for [89]Mac OS X.^[90][9] On March 18,
   2008, the Mac OS X version started shipping.^[91][4]

[[102]edit] Gameplay

   Quake Wars is a class-based, objective focused, team-oriented game.
   Teams are based on human (GDF) and alien (Strogg) technology. While the
   teams are asymmetrical, both sides have the same basic weapons and
   tools to complete objectives. Unlike other team-based online games
   (such as the [103]Battlefield series), the gameplay is much more
   focused on one or two main objectives at once, rather than spread all
   over the combat area. This allows for much more focused and intense
   combat situations, similar to the original [104]Unreal Tournament
   assault mode.

   Each player class from each side normally has new objectives show up
   during game play, many times based around the specific capabilities of
   your class. The game also has the capability to group players into
   fireteams for greater coordinated strategy. These fireteams can be user
   created or game generated depending on the mission selected by the
   player.

   The game has an experience points (XP) rewards system in place, which
   rewards every player some points depending on the mission completed.
   This accumulated XP later leads to unlocks which may vary from
   availability of new equipment/weapons to abilities like faster movement
   or more accurate weapons.^[105][10] These rewards are reset to zero
   after the completion of every campaign, which consists of three unique
   maps, all with a common locale/region.

   Online and offline play modes are available with different modes for
   computer and console players: PC/Mac and Linux versions let you play
   individual campaigns/maps/stopwatch games against bots while the
   console versions have full single player campaigns (The single-player
   allows for combat as both sides over the course of the game.) The Human
   weapons and vehicles are based on modern combat weapons/vehicles but
   updated for the futuristic time period of the game. The Strogg have
   alien weapons and vehicles, some similar to what the humans have and
   some unique.

[[106]edit] Asymmetric teams

   While Quake Wars features asymmetric teams, there are corresponding
   classes and weapons for each side. Some of the major differences are as
   follows:

[[107]edit] Health, ammo, weaponry and vehicles

   The GDF use health and ammo packs distributed by Medics and Field Ops,
   respectively.

   The Strogg feature one source of both ammo and health called stroyent.
   Stroyent can be seen running through the weaponry of the Strogg and
   only picked up from one source, the Technician. One Stroyent cell gives
   you a combination of 18 health and 40 ammo. You can also replenish your
   ammo or health supply by sacrificing one surplus to the other using a
   technique called "Stroyent Swapping". Due to their unique health
   supplies, their reviving techniques are much different (see the
   Medic/Technician section below).

   While the Strogg and GDF feature similar weaponry, there is a key
   difference in weapon usage. The GDF have a limited ammo supply and must
   reload on emptying a magazine. The Strogg do not have to reload, but
   prolonged fire can lead to their gun overheating.

   Likewise, there are significant differences among the vehicles made
   available to the Strogg and GDF. While the vehicle classifications are
   inherently similar in implementation, there are substantial
   differences. Typically speaking, Strogg vehicles are of a higher
   "tech-level" than those of the GDF and offer more overall tactical
   flexibility. Strogg vehicles are also more heavily armed than their GDF
   counterparts and some GDF vehicles are devoid of weapons completely.

[[108]edit] Classes

   Soldier/Aggressor

   The Soldier and Aggressor are the standard grunts of each army. They
   get a health bonus and the widest array of weapons to choose from
   (Assault Rifle/Lacerator, GPMG/Hyperblaster, Rocket
   Launcher/Obliterator, and Shotgun/Nailgun), as well as a much stronger
   sidearm (Machine Pistol/Lightning Pistol). They are key players in
   taking out deployables and vehicles, or taking out objectives that
   require explosive charges.

   Field Ops/Oppressor

   The Field Ops and Oppressor plays a major supporting role. Each side
   can place offensive indirect weaponry such as the Hammer Missile/Dark
   Matter Cannon, Rocket Artillery/Plasma Mortar or the Artillery
   Cannon/Rail Howitzer. These must be fired by the Field Ops/Oppressor by
   spotting the desired target. Both can place colored smoke grenade
   beacons that call in further indirect fire: a Vampire bomber air-strike
   for the GDF, and an Orbital Strike beam for the Strogg. Field Ops can
   give out ammunition packs, while Strogg Oppressors have the ability to
   place temporary tactical shields to keep themselves and their allies
   out of the line of enemy fire.

   Medic/Technician

   The Medics and Technicians play a further supporting role. Medics can
   give out health and revive team mates instantly, at 50% health, using
   the defibrillator paddles. They also have the ability to signal via a
   colored smoke grenade for a Supply Station to be dropped that includes
   both health and ammo. Also, for each Medic on the team, the health of
   all members is increased by a small amount. The Technicians can give
   out stroyent, which replenishes both health and ammunition. The
   stroyent tool can also be used to revive a fallen Strogg, but unlike
   the Medic paddles, it is not instantaneous and takes a few moments.
   Finally, Technicians can also inject stroyent into a fallen GDF
   soldier, turning him into a Spawn Host which, when claimed by a fellow
   Strogg, will cause them to spawn at the location of the Spawn Host,
   instead than their usual location; but this can only be used once, and
   after spawning at the Host, it disappears. Spawn Hosts can only be
   destroyed by Medics with their paddles.

   Engineer/Constructor

   Engineers and Constructors are primarily defensive and strategic units.
   They can place anti-vehicle, anti-personnel, and anti-artillery
   turrets. Along with turrets, up to three proximity or trip mines can be
   placed. Engineers and Constructors have the ability to repair all
   friendly vehicles and turrets, as well as build certain objectives or
   useful outposts.

   Covert Ops/Infiltrator

   Covert Ops and Infiltrators can both hack enemy deployables and
   objectives, disabling them for 60 seconds and damaging it 50% if held
   long enough, as well as use EMP/Scrambler Grenades on turrets and
   vehicles for a 30 second disable. Both of these classes can steal enemy
   uniforms as well, taking on the name and appearance of the enemy, and
   then use their powerful back stab attacks to take out unsuspecting
   enemies, killing them instantly. The disguise is removed, though, if
   the player attacks an enemy in front of another, if they attack an
   enemy from the front, use their ranged weapon, or use the hacking tool.
   The Covert Ops has a Third-Eye Camera that creates a localized radar,
   can be used to view its surroundings, and can be destroyed remotely. He
   also has smoke grenades that will visually obscure the view of troops
   over the affected area (deployables can see through the smoke). The
   Infiltrator has an explosive Flyer Drone; if this Drone is destroyed by
   the enemy the Infiltrator will take damage. The Infiltrator also has a
   Teleporter Beacon, used for getting into key sniping positions or
   taking objectives with ease. Finally, both classes can deploy Radar/Psi
   Radar, which are capable of detecting enemy units within a wide range.

[[109]edit] Deployables

   Engineer/Constructor

   The GDF Engineer and Strogg Constructor have access to three different
   defensive deployable turrets - The Anti-Personnel Turret (APT),
   Anti-Vehicle Turret (AVT) and the Artillery Interceptor Turret (AIT).
   The APT will engage any enemy Infantry that comes within range and
   visibility of the turret and will give the engaged target a lock on
   warning. The AVT is like the APT but will engage any manned vehicle
   within range and visibility of its missiles. The AIT will not engage
   infantry, vehicles or air strikes but will instead engage artillery
   bombardments in its defensive area.

   Field Ops/Oppressors

   The Field Ops have access to offensive deployables in the game. The
   Artillery Turret/Rail howitzer can effectively fire a salvo of ten
   rounds into a specified area. The Rocket Artillery/Plasma Mortar can
   fire up to six rockets at a designated area or can lock on to enemy
   vehicles or deployables. It can also be re-targeted "on the fly" while
   firing if the person who deployed it uses their targeting laser to
   designate a new target. The Hammer Launcher/Dark Matter Cannon launches
   a single, slow-moving round with an warhead that will kill any
   infantry, destroy any ground based vehicle, and disable (or destroy)
   any deployable in its area effect.

   Covert Ops/Infiltrators

   The Covert Ops and Infiltrators have access to the Radar and Psi Radar,
   respectively, which provide radar coverage of a large area once
   deployed and will give infantry within its range a positions and
   orientations of enemy infantry, vehicles and deployables.

[[110]edit] MegaTexture

          Main article: [111]MegaTexture

   MegaTexture is a [112]texture mapping technique developed by [113]John
   Carmack of [114]id Software. The technology allows maps to be totally
   unique, without any repeated terrain tiles. Battlefields can be
   rendered to the horizon without any fogging, with over a square mile of
   terrain at inch-level detail, while also providing terrain-type detail
   that defines such factors as bullet hit effects, vehicle traction,
   sound effects, and so on. Each megatexture is derived from a 3276832768
   pixels (1024 megapixels, or a gigapixel) image, which takes up around 3
   gigabytes in its raw form (with 3 bytes per pixel, one byte for each
   color channel).

[[115]edit] Beta and demo releases

   The public beta opened to [116]FilePlanet paid subscribers on [117]June
   20, [118]2007 and to nonpaying members on [119]June 23, [120]2007.
   There were also beta keys given out for a limited time exclusively at
   [121]QuakeCon 2007. The public beta ended on [122]September 25,
   [123]2007. A second build of the beta was released on [124]August 3,
   [125]2007. It features a new map entitled Valley to replace Sewer and
   several changes to the game code to improve performance and implement
   new features. This map was featured in tutorial videos released prior
   to the beta, and was the map made available to play at [126]QuakeCon
   2006.

   A PC demo for Windows was released on [127]September 10, [128]2007 and
   for Linux on [129]October 16, [130]2007 also featuring the map Valley.
   The full Linux version was released on [131]October 19, [132]2007. A
   Mac OS X client has also been released.

   As of [144]February 9, 2008 on the review aggregator [145]Game
   Rankings, the PC version of the game had an average score of 84% based
   on 55 reviews.^[146][11] On [147]Metacritic, the game had a score of 84
   out of 100 based on 52 reviews.^[148][12] Kevin VanOrd of [149]GameSpot
   gave the game a rating of 8.5/10.^[150][13]

   Other reviews are generally very positive, scoring Quake Wars in the 89
   (out of 10) range.^[151][14]

   For the week ending September 29, 2007, Quake Wars was the best selling
   PC title in the [152]United Kingdom according to the Entertainment and
   Leisure Software Publishers Association.^[153][15]

   And on [154]October 17th, [155]2007, after its top of the charts sale
   in the United Kingdom, Quake Wars debuted at a familiar #1 spot yet
   again in the United States. According to NPD group's top 10 best
   selling PC game charts, it managed to take the #1 spot.^[156][16]

   [157]Xbox 360 and [158]PlayStation 3 reviews for the game were
   generally much less positive, with [159]IGN giving the 360 version 6.1
   and the PlayStation 3 version 5.3, citing game issues and slightly
   inferior graphics to the PC version as causes for the lower score.
