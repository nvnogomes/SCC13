   Edward Willis Redfield ([15]December 18, [16]1869[17]October 19,
   [18]1965) was an [19]American Impressionist [20]landscape painter and
   member of the [21]art colony at [22]New Hope, Pennsylvania. He is best
   known today for his [23]impressionist scenes of the New Hope area,
   often depicting the snow-covered countryside.

   Redfield was born in 1869 in [24]Bridgeville, Delaware. He showed
   artistic talent at an early age, and from 1887 to 1889 studied at the
   [25]Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in [26]Philadelphia. While
   there he met [27]Robert Henri, who was later to become an important
   American painter of the [28]Ashcan School, and the two became lifelong
   friends. Redfield later traveled to France and studied at the
   [29]Acadmie Julian and the [30]cole des Beaux-Arts. In Europe, Redfield
   admired the work of impressionist painters [31]Claude Monet,
   [32]Camille Pissarro, and Norwegian [33]Fritz Thaulow. In France he met
   Elise Deligant, the daughter of an innkeeper, and the two married in
   1893.

   Redfield and his wife returned to America and settled in [34]Centre
   Bridge, Pennsylvania, near New Hope. Redfield was the first painter to
   move to the area, and is sometimes considered a co-founder of the
   artist colony at New Hope along with [35]William Langson Lathrop.

   The impressionist landscapes of Edward Redfield are noted for their
   bold application of paint and vibrant color. Redfield painted [36]en
   plein air, directly from nature rather than in a studio. He would often
   carry a large canvas into the snow, set it on an easel, and vigorously
   paint an entire scene in one standing over the course of a day. His
   works were exhibited nation-wide, and twenty-seven of them were
   featured at the [37]Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915) in
   San Francisco, an important venue for artists of the time.

   Redfield was a harsh critic of his own art. In 1947 he burned a large
   number of his paintings that he considered sub-standard. It was around
   that time that he stopped painting. Redfield died on October 19, 1965.
   Today his paintings are in many major museums, including the
   [38]Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the [39]Smithsonian
   American Art Museum in Washington, DC.
