   [22]Air Commodore Edward Alexander Dimsdale Masterman [23]CB [24]CMG
   [25]CBE [26]AFC [27]RAF (15 April 1880 26 August 1957) was a senior
   officer in the [28]Royal Air Force in the first half of the 20th
   century. After retiring from the RAF, he served as the first ever
   Commandant of the [29]Observer Corps.

[[30]edit] Service career

   Masterman started his service career in the [31]Royal Navy, attending
   the [32]Britannia Naval College around 1894. After serving on [33]HMS
   Revenge in the late 1890s and early 1900s, he attended Torpedo
   Specialist Course and in 1907 he worked as a Russia interpreter on
   [34]HMS Vernon.

   By 1911 Masterman had become involved in the Navy's efforts to built an
   experimental [35]airship and the following year he was appointed
   Officer Commanding the Naval Airship Section.

   During [36]World War I, Masterman served in the [37]Royal Naval Air
   Service, commanding the Farnborough Airship Station and working in
   several technical posts. With the establishment of the [38]Royal Air
   Force on 1 April 1918, Masterman transferred to the new service. Just
   before the end of the war, he was promoted to [39]brigadier-general and
   appointed [40]General Officer Commanding [41]No. 22 Group. His rank was
   commuted to Air Commodore when current RAF ranks were introduced.

[[42]edit] Observer Corps

   Between 1 March 1929 when he retired from the RAF and 1 April 1936,
   Masterman was the Commandant of the [43]Observer Corps and was the
   first former RAF officer to hold this appointment. Headquarters Royal
   Observer Corps was located at Hillingdon House, [44]RAF Uxbridge, only
   relocating to [45]RAF Bentley Priory after Masterman retired. He was
   succeeded as Commandant Observer Corps by [46]Air Commodore
   Warrington-Morris.

   Following his retirement as Commandant, Air Commodore Masterman
   immediately rejoined the Royal Observer Corps as a civilian part time
   volunteer with the rank of Observer Captain and served as the ROC's
   Western Area Commandant between 1937 and 1942, although by special
   permission of Warrington-Morris, he was permitted to wear his RAF Air
   Commodore's uniform and rank braid after April 1941 when the Observer
   Corps became the Royal Observer Corps and part of [47]Fighter Command.
