   eMachines is a maker of low-cost [24]PCs based in [25]Irvine,
   California. It employed about 135 employees and sold between 1 to 2
   million computers per year before its purchase on [26]January 30,
   [27]2004, by rival [28]Gateway Computers. Gateway was purchased by
   [29]Acer in October 2007, and eMachines is still used as a brand for
   low-cost PCs.

[[34]edit] History

   The company appeared in September 1998, as a joint venture between
   Korean monitor maker Korea Data Systems (KDS) and Korean computer
   manufacturer [35]TriGem, announcing models at price points of $299,
   $399, $499, and $599, all without a monitor. At the time, few PCs sold
   for less than $699, and $999 was a more common price point for
   entry-level PCs. The first units shipped in November of the same year.
   eMachines PCs quickly became common in retail stores and touched off a
   ruinous price war involving [36]Compaq, [37]HP, [38]IBM, and
   [39]Packard Bell. eMachines PCs were frequently offered with large
   rebates, provided the consumer signed a long-term contract with an
   [40]internet service provider, driving down the price further.

   By early 2000, eMachines was the fifth-largest seller of PCs, in terms
   of volume, in the world,^[[41]citation needed] and had helped drive
   Packard Bell and IBM, as well as several smaller value-oriented
   vendors, from the US retail market.^[[42]citation needed]

   In March 2000, hoping to further cash in on the [43]dot-com boom,
   eMachines filed an [44]Initial Public Offering with its share price set
   at $9. But with thin profit margins and declining sales, the company
   quickly started losing money and received a threat of being delisted by
   [45]NASDAQ in late December 2000. Its stock price, which had peaked at
   $10, had fallen as low as 14 cents. The company went private in
   December 2001.

   Continuing price pressure from eMachines, along with [46]Dell's
   aggressive pursuit of the home computer market, contributed to the
   merger between [47]HP and [48]Compaq^[[49]citation needed]. At the end
   of 2003, eMachines was the #3 personal computer maker in the world, in
   terms of sales figures, behind Dell and HP.^[[50]citation needed]

   Before the company went private in 2001, eMachines' desktop components
   were generally considered of poor quality.^[[51]citation needed] After
   the private buy-out, however, eMachines began using higher quality,
   off-the-shelf components in its desktops.

   In December 2003, eMachines released the T6000 desktop, the world's
   first mass-marketed AMD [52]Athlon 64-based system, at $1,150US retail.
   The systems were primarily sold through [53]Best Buy stores, but were
   also available online. They were also the first company to sell
   notebooks based on the AMD Mobile Athlon 64, with the launch of its
   M6000 series in January 2004.

   July 2004, eMachines began to shake the perception that their computers
   were of poor quality when PC Magazine reported "Among systems less than
   a year old, eMachines users report the fewest serious problems.
   eMachines' low-cost PCs are less likely to need repairs than systems
   from any other vendor. Whereas only 9 percent of eMachines desktops
   less than a year old needed repairs, according to readers, the rates of
   comparably new systems from Dell and Gateway needing repairs were 11
   and 15 percent, respectively. Only 1 percent of all eMachines systems
   needed to be replaced."^[54][1]

   eMachines was acquired by Gateway, Inc. in March 2004 for $262 million
   in cash and shares. Under the deal, [55]Wayne Inouye, CEO of eMachines,
   became CEO of Gateway, replacing founder [56]Ted Waitt. It remains a
   stand-alone brand that is sold through retailers, catalog and online
   merchandisers.

[[57]edit] Controversies

   Units such as the eMachines m6811 (released in 2004), have been
   reported to have faulty hinges and power adapters. eMachines has
   admitted to these factory faults and has been good in replacing the
   parts. Despite that fact, the replaced parts tend to break as before,
   thus making many users think the hinges were only replaced with the
   faulty previous parts which eMachines decided not to recall. Power
   adapters have been known to break off in the laptop's power port and
   sometimes become a fire hazard. Like their tactic with the defective
   hinges, eMachines has attempted to replace the power adapters but
   users^[[58]who?] report that the replacements have continued to break.
   Eventually, eMachines began to change the power adapters' connections
   by having the plug detach from the main power cord.^[59][2]
