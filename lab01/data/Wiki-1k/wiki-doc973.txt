[[21]edit] Early life

   Born in Indiana to Elbert L. Pauley and the former Ellen Van Petten, he
   attended [22]Occidental College northeast of [23]Los Angeles during
   1919-20 before getting a degree from the [24]University of California,
   Berkeley in 1922, where he was a member of [25]Phi Kappa Psi
   fraternity, and an M.S. a year later.

[[26]edit] Oil career

   Pauley made his fortune running oil companies from the mid-1920s
   onward. He founded The Petrol Corp. in 1923. Pauley was president of
   Fortuna Petroleum by 1933. In 1938 he was appointed to fill an
   unexpired term on the UC Berkeley Board of Regents, and remained a
   regent until 1972. In 1940 he served as a member of the Interstate Oil
   and Compact Commission; then in 1941 became Roosevelt's petroleum
   coordinator for war in Europe on petroleum [27]lend-lease supplies for
   Russia and England. He was involved in a wide variety of oil business
   deals, and was sometimes described as an "oil king-pin." In 1947 he
   bought Coconut Island in Hawaii, as a private retreat.[28][1]Several of
   his deals involved [29]Zapata Corporation, run by [30]George H. W.
   Bush, including a joint-venture with Pemargo in 1960. In 1958 he
   founded Pauley Petroleum which, with Howard Hughes, expanded oil
   production in the [31]Gulf of Mexico.

   Later Pauley also became a part owner of the [32]Los Angeles Rams
   football team and a director of [33]Western Airlines.

[[34]edit] Politics

   Pauley became involved with the [35]Democratic Party as a fundraiser in
   1930s, eventually becoming treasurer of the [36]Democratic National
   Committee. He was director of the Democratic convention in 1944. He was
   a friend and confidante of [37]Harry S. Truman, and through Truman's
   influence he was appointed as Petroleum Coordinator of Lend-Lease
   Supplies for the Soviet Union and Britain. As president, Truman
   appointed him United States representative to the [38]Allied
   Reparations Committee from 1945-1947. With the rank of ambassador, as
   well as industrial and commercial advisor to the Potsdam Conference,
   his chief task was to renegotiate the reparations agreements formulated
   at Yalta (many of which affected Dulles' former clients). When Truman
   tried to appoint him [39]Undersecretary of the Navy in 1946,
   [40]Secretary of the Interior [41]Harold Ickes resigned in protest at
   the conflict of interest given Pauley's ties to the oil industry.
   Ickes' resignation scuttled the appointment, and Pauley worked behind
   the scenes thereafter.

   By successive appointments from several California governors, Pauley
   served as a [42]University of California Regent from 1940 to 1972. The
   [43]Pauley Pavilion at [44]University of California, Los Angeles is
   named in his honor for his philanthropy and service as a Regent.

   By the 1960s, Pauley came to support [45]Ronald Reagan. He was the
   Board of Regents' harshest critic of student protests on UC
   campuses.[46][2]

[[47]edit] Ties to OSS, CIA, and FBI

[[48]edit] 1945-1965: OSS, and CIA?

   Pauley allegedly had close ties to [49]OSS officer [50]Allen Dulles
   (later CIA Director), and it is confirmed that CIA Director [51]John
   McCone knew him personally, despite Dulles' and McCone's Republican
   affiliations.[52][3] Pauley aided the Dulles brothers former clients in
   shifting Nazi assets out of Europe and out of Soviet hands or
   knowledge. Pauley also assisted surveying Japan's assets and
   determining the amount of its war debt.

   Pauley left government in the late 1940s and returned to being an
   independent oil-man. Through his business in the Caribbean he and
   [53]Howard Hughes allegedly granted some access to CIA officials. It is
   not known if the deal with [54]Zapata Corporation was similarly useful
   to the CIA. He also allegedly engaged in money-laundering through
   Mexican banks, in part to disguise campaign contributions -- including
   those to [55]Richard Nixon.^[[56]citation needed]

[[57]edit] 1965-1972: CIA, FBI, and UC Berkeley anti-war protests

   In 1965, Pauley was serving as a Regent at the University of
   California, when [58]anti-Vietnam war campus protests began to grow. At
   Pauley's request, CIA Director [59]John McCone met with FBI Director
   [60]J. Edgar Hoover on January 28th and Hoover agreed to leak to Pauley
   information about [61]UC Berkeley President [62]Clark Kerr. (See
   [63]memo regarding McCone's request to meet with Hoover. McCone
   graduated from [64]UC Berkeley in 1922, the year before Pauley.) At
   that meeting, McCone told Hoover that Pauley was very upset about the
   "situation at Berkeley", and was "anxious to get a line on any persons
   who are communists or have communist associations, either on the
   faculty or in the student body." As soon as McCone left his office,
   Hoover phoned Los Angeles FBI chief [65]Wesley Grapp, and ordered him
   to give Pauley anonymous memos on regents, faculty members, and
   students who were "causing trouble at Berkeley." Hoover admonished
   Grapp, "It must be impressed upon Mr. Pauley that this data is being
   furnished in strict confidence."[66][4]
   1965 memo to J. Edgar Hoover from CIA Director John McCone, re: UC
   Berkeley protests.

   Five days later (February 2nd) Grapp met with Pauley for two hours at
   his office in the Pauley Petroleum Building in Los Angeles. Grapp
   provided him information from FBI files on other Regents, faculty, and
   students who were considered "ultra-liberal." The CIA and FBI worked in
   conjunction with [67]Ronald Reagan, who sought to mount a
   "psychological warfare campaign" against the budding [68]Free Speech
   Movement and anti-war sit-ins, including using tax-evasion and "any
   other available" charges in which the FBI agreed to assist. "This has
   been done in the past, and has worked quite successfully," Hoover
   noted.[69][5][70][6] [71][7]

   (This information was not made public until 2002, after a fifteen-year
   legal battle with the FBI that went all the way to the US Supreme
   Court, as a result of a [72]FOIA request for an in-depth San Francisco
   Chronicle investigation. The FBI had claimed it needed to maintain
   secrecy to "protect law enforcement operations." The [73]National
   Security Act of 1947 bars the CIA from engaging in domestic
   intelligence activities.) [74][8]

   Pauley began the February 2, 1965 meeting with Grapp by saying he was
   upset about the [75]Free Speech Movement and recalled that "obnoxious
   question... concerning the FBI being a secret police" (referring to a
   1959 entry exam question.) He told Grapp he had "no use for [UC
   President] Kerr" and had accused Kerr of being a "communist or a
   communist follower." Pauley explained that the 24-member Board of
   Regents was divided and that his faction wanted "strong positive action
   taken immediately to clean up the mess."^[[76]citation needed] The
   problem, he said, was that so far he'd been unable to muster the votes
   to fire Kerr. He blamed the impasse on three "ultra-liberal" regents
   who staunchly backed Kerr. Governor [77]Pat Brown ([78]D)) had named to
   the board: [79]William Coblentz (Brown's former special counsel);
   [80]William M. Roth (member of the [81]ACLU executive committee); and
   [82]Elinor Raas Heller (member of the [83]Democratic National
   Committee).

   Pauley told Grapp that in the 1950s the FBI secretly gave the
   university reports on professors it was considering hiring. He said he
   wanted to restore the procedure -- which the FBI had code-named the
   [84]Responsibilities Program -- and offered to pay someone to check FBI
   files. After obtaining Pauley's promise not to reveal that the FBI was
   his source, Grapp handed him Hoover's memos. Pauley quickly read one.
   "This is perfect," he said. "This is just what I need."^[[85]citation
   needed] It was a three-page report on UC Berkeley immunology professor
   [86]Leon Wofsy that summarized news stories from 1945 to 1956, noting
   that Wofsy had been a self-avowed Communist Party official who tried to
   get young people involved with the party. (The report failed to note
   that since 1957 the FBI had found no evidence that Wofsy had been
   involved with the party.)

   Two days later, Grapp reported to Hoover that Pauley would be "an
   excellent source of information" about internal university affairs.
   Pauley could also "use his influence to curtail, harass and at times
   eliminate communists and ultra-liberal members on the
   faculty"^[[87]citation needed] -- and on the Board of Regents. About a
   week later, Grapp secretly gave Pauley verbal reports containing
   confidential information about regents Coblentz, Roth and Heller --
   even though they had fully disclosed it to the bureau and held
   top-level security clearances. Pauley, Grapp reported to Hoover, was
   "most appreciative" of the information on his opponents. As Pauley saw
   it, according to Grapp's report, UC would remain in turmoil "as long as
   the current officials were in power at the university."

   That fall, thousands of students joined the escalating protests. To
   Pauley and the FBI, it was further proof that Kerr had lost control of
   the university. Pauley confided to Grapp that two alumni were taking
   things into their own hands. They had recruited athletes to "beat up
   the demonstrators" and hired a barber to "forcibly 'shear' the students
   who need it."^[[88]citation needed] Grapp continued to slip Pauley
   anonymous memos about students and faculty -- at least two dozen more
   -- that he could use in persuading the regents to fire Kerr. But in
   October, a frustrated Pauley told Grapp he was still "two votes short
   to fire Clark Kerr."^[[89]citation needed] Kerr would remain in charge
   of the university, it seemed, as long as Brown remained governor.

   When [90]Ronald Reagan was elected California's governor in 1966, after
   campaigning against "campus malcontents and filthy speech advocates" at
   Berkeley, one of his first moves was to fire Kerr. Reagan's Legal
   Affairs Secretary, Herbert Ellingwood, met with FBI agent Cartha "Deke"
   DeLoach at FBI Headquarters, and noted that Reagan was "dedicated to
   the destruction of disruptive elements on college campuses."[91][9]
