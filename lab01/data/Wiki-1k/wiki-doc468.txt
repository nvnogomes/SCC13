   Jerry Davis (born 1973) was an American professional wrestler, manager,
   commissioner, writer and promoter better known as Dude Rock.
   RCW Board of Director Member Dude Rock and his wife Sharon Rock attend
   business in the ring.

   He is best known for using the [11]hardcore style and also his comedic
   wrestling performances. He has wrestled in numerous American
   [12]wrestling promotions, such as [13]Superstar Wrestling Federation
   (Ohio), [14]Ohio Championship Wrestling, [15]World Wrestling Coalition
   and [16]Revolutionary Championship Wrestling.

   A fan of professional wrestling since his youth, he did not start
   training until he was 27 years old. He started training with [17]Andy
   Runyon's Superstar Wrestling Federation in early 2000. He made his
   wrestling debut as Pele, one half of a dancing [18]lucha tag team
   called "The Lords of the Dance" in 2001, quickly winning the SWF Tag
   Team Championships twice. He served on the booking committee for two
   years, and served as a writer.

   On December 15, 2001 he made his debut as "The Dude" a brooding punk
   rock wannabe, managing "Too Fine" Jason Taylor at SWF: Christmas Chaos
   in the Oliver School near [19]West Union, Ohio.

   On February 8, 2002 he would re-emerge as Dude Rock(a happy go lucky
   mullet wearing 80's hair band reject) in a match against The
   Zodiac.^[20][1] His ring style was noted for his lack of offense and
   preposition to just do the [21]hip toss as a main offensive move. The
   fans quickly took to him and he would enter the arena with his
   trademark high pitched "Wassup?!?!?" to which the fans would respond in
   kind.

   In 2002 he would defeat SWF Hardcore Champion "The Attitude" Andy
   Runyon for the Championship with help from [22]Trik Nasty.

   In 2002 the SWF would dissolve and he would go on to help Dirk
   Cunningham with his [23]Revolutionary Championship Wrestling(RCW) based
   in [24]Portsmouth, Ohio. He served briefly as a writer, and [25]booker.

   Title

   He had mixed success winning the Extreme (2003) and Internet
   Championships (2004), but having them stripped due to no showing
   scheduled title defenses.

   Dude Rock seemingly retired from wrestling 2004 but made a brief return
   to wrestle Tank Runyon for the [26]World Wrestling Coalition.

   On December 11, 2004 Dude Rock was announced as the surprise write in
   candidate and winner of the election for RCW Commissioner, at this
   point he was always accompanied to the ring by his personal assistant
   (and real life wife) [27]Sharon Rock.

   He held te position of Commissioner until December 2, 2006 when he was
   defeated for his bid at a third term by the fans electing the [28]Loony
   Referee Mike Horton after a long feud between the two performers .

   It has been since announced that he has been retained as a member of
   the RCW Board of Directors.
