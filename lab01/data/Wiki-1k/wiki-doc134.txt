   El Greco (1541 April 7, 1614) was a [25]painter, [26]sculptor, and
   [27]architect of the [28]Spanish Renaissance. "El Greco" (The
   [29]Greek) was a nickname,^[30][a]^[31][b] a reference to his Greek
   origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full
   birth name in [32]Greek letters, (Domnikos Theotokpoulos).

   El Greco was born in [33]Crete, which was at that time part of the
   [34]Republic of Venice, and the centre of [35]Post-Byzantine art. He
   trained and became a master within that tradition before travelling at
   age 26 to [36]Venice, as other Greek artists had done.^[37][1] In 1570
   he moved to [38]Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series
   of works. During his stay in [39]Italy, El Greco enriched his style
   with elements of [40]Mannerism and of the [41]Venetian Renaissance. In
   1577, he moved to [42]Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until
   his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and
   produced his best known paintings.

   El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement
   by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El
   Greco is regarded as a precursor of both [43]Expressionism and
   [44]Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of
   inspiration for poets and writers such as [45]Rainer Maria Rilke and
   [46]Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern
   scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional
   school.^[47][2] He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and
   often fantastic or phantasmagorical [48]pigmentation, marrying
   [49]Byzantine traditions with those of [50]Western painting.^[51][3]

[[73]edit] Life

[[74]edit] Early years and family

   Born in 1541 in either the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian
   name of Chandax, present day [75]Heraklion) in Crete,^[76][c] El Greco
   was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had probably been
   driven out of [77]Chania to Candia after an uprising against the
   [78]Venetians between 1526 and 1528.^[79][4] El Greco's father, Gergios
   Theotokpoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and [80]tax collector. Nothing
   is known about his mother or his first wife, a Greek woman.^[81][5] El
   Greco's older brother, Manossos Theotokpoulos (1531 December 13, 1604),
   was a wealthy merchant and spent the last years of his life (16031604)
   in El Greco's Toledo home.^[82][6]
   [83]The Dormition of the Virgin (before 1567, [84]tempera and gold on
   panel, 61,4 45 cm, Holy Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin,
   [85]Hermoupolis, [86]Syros) was probably created near the end of the
   artist's Cretan period. The painting combines post-Byzantine and
   Italian mannerist stylistic and iconographic elements.

   El Greco received his initial training as an [87]icon painter of the
   [88]Cretan school, the leading centre of post-Byzantine art. In
   addition to painting, he probably studied the [89]classics of
   [90]ancient Greece, and perhaps the [91]Latin classics also; he left a
   "working library" of 130 books at his death, including the Bible in
   Greek and an annotated [92]Vasari.^[93][1] Candia was a center for
   artistic activity where Eastern and Western cultures co-existed
   harmoniously, where around two hundred painters were active during the
   16th century, and had organized a [94]painters' guild, based on the
   Italian model.^[95][4] In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was
   described in a document as a "master" ("maestro Domenigo"), meaning he
   was already a master of the guild and presumably operating his own
   workshop.^[96][1] Three years later, in June 1566, as a witness to a
   contract, he signed his name as (Master Mengos Theotokpoulos,
   painter).^[97][d]

   Most scholars believe that the Theotokpoulos "family was almost
   certainly Greek Orthodox",^[98][7] although some Catholic sources still
   claim him from birth.^[99][e] Like many [100]Orthodox emigrants to
   Europe, he apparently transferred to Catholicism after his arrival, and
   certainly practiced as a Catholic in Spain, where he described himself
   as a "devout Catholic" in his will. The extensive archival research
   conducted since the early 1960s by scholars, such as Nikolaos
   Panayotakis, Pandelis Prevelakis and Maria Constantoudaki, indicates
   strongly that El Greco's family and ancestors were Greek Orthodox. One
   of his uncles was an Orthodox priest, and his name is not mentioned in
   the Catholic archival baptismal records on Crete.^[101][8] Prevelakis
   goes even further, expressing his doubt that El Greco was ever a
   practicing Roman Catholic.^[102][9]

[[103]edit] Italy

   Portrait of Giorgio Giulio Clovio, the earliest surviving portrait from
   El Greco (c. 1570, [104]oil on canvas, 58 86 cm, [105]Museo di
   Capodimonte, [106]Naples). In the portrait of Clovio, friend and
   supporter in Rome of the young Cretan artist, the first evidence of El
   Greco's gifts as a [107]portraitist are apparent.

   It was natural for the young El Greco to pursue his career in Venice,
   Crete having been a possession of the Republic of Venice since
   1211.^[108][2] Though the exact year is not clear, most scholars agree
   that El Greco went to Venice around 1567.^[109][f] Knowledge of El
   Greco's years in Italy is limited. He lived in Venice until 1570 and,
   according to a letter written by his much older friend, the greatest
   miniaturist of the age, the Croatian [110]Giulio Clovio, was a
   "disciple" of [111]Titian, who was by then in his eighties but still
   vigorous. This may mean he worked in Titian's large studio, or not.
   Clovio characterized El Greco as "a rare talent in painting".^[112][10]

   In 1570 El Greco moved to Rome, where he executed a series of works
   strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship.^[113][10] It is unknown
   how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice (c.
   15751576) before he left for Spain.^[114][11] In Rome, on the
   recommendation of Giulio Clovio,^[115][12] El Greco was received as a
   guest at the [116]Palazzo Farnese, which [117]Cardinal Alessandro
   Farnese had made a centre of the artistic and intellectual life of the
   city. There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the
   city, including the Roman scholar [118]Fulvio Orsini, whose collection
   would later include seven paintings by the artist (View of [119]Mt.
   Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them).^[120][13]

   Unlike other Cretan artists who had moved to Venice, El Greco
   substantially altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by
   inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious
   subject matter.^[121][14] His works painted in Italy were influenced by
   the Venetian Renaissance style of the period, with agile, elongated
   figures reminiscent of [122]Tintoretto and a chromatic framework that
   connects him to Titian.^[123][2] The Venetian painters also taught him
   to organize his multi-figured compositions in landscapes vibrant with
   atmospheric light. Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer's day
   while the artist was still in Rome. El Greco was sitting in a darkened
   room, because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the
   light of the day, which disturbed his "inner light".^[124][15] As a
   result of his stay in Rome, his works were enriched with elements such
   as violent [125]perspective vanishing points or strange attitudes
   struck by the figures with their repeated twisting and turning and
   tempestuous gestures; all elements of Mannerism.^[126][10]

   By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, [127]Michelangelo and
   [128]Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount and
   left little room for different approaches. Although the artistic
   heritage of these great masters was overwhelming for young painters, El
   Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his
   personal artistic views, ideas and style.^[129][16] He singled out
   [130]Correggio and [131]Parmigianino for particular praise,^[132][17]
   but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the
   [133]Sistine Chapel;^[134][g] he extended an offer to [135]Pope Pius V
   to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter
   Catholic thinking.^[136][18] When he was later asked what he thought
   about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that "he was a good man, but he
   did not know how to paint".^[137][19] And thus we are confronted by a
   paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even
   condemned Michelangelo, but he had found it impossible to withstand his
   influence.^[138][20] Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El
   Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League.^[139][21] By
   painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably,
   Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco
   not only expressed his gratitude but advanced the claim to rival these
   masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian,
   Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate.^[140][18] In his 17th
   century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters
   who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's
   teachings.^[141][22]

   Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal
   of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired
   enemies in Rome. Architect and writer [142]Pirro Ligorio called him a
   "foolish foreigner", and newly discovered archival material reveals a
   skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his
   palace.^[143][22] On July 6, 1572, El Greco officially complained about
   this event. A few months later, on September 18, 1572, El Greco paid
   his dues to the [144]Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a [145]miniature
   painter.^[146][23] At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own
   workshop and hired as assistants the painters Lattanzio Bonastri de
   Lucignano and Francisco Preboste.^[147][22]

[[148]edit] Spain

[[149]edit] Immigration to Toledo

   The Assumption of the Virgin (15771579, oil on canvas, 401 228 cm,
   [150]Art Institute of Chicago) was one of the nine paintings El Greco
   completed for the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo, his
   first commission in Spain.

   In 1577, El Greco emigrated first to [151]Madrid, then to Toledo, where
   he produced his mature works.^[152][24] At the time, Toledo was the
   religious capital of Spain and a populous city^[153][h] with "an
   illustrious past, a prosperous present and an uncertain
   future".^[154][25] In Rome, El Greco had earned the respect of some
   intellectuals, but was also facing the hostility of certain [155]art
   critics.^[156][26] During the 1570s the huge monastery-palace of
   [157]El Escorial was still under construction and [158]Philip II of
   Spain was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the
   many large paintings required to decorate it. Titian was dead, and
   [159]Tintoretto, [160]Veronese and [161]Anthonis Mor all refused to
   come to Spain. Philip had had to rely on the lesser talent of [162]Juan
   Fernndes de Navarrete, whose gravedad y decoro ("seriousness and
   decorum") the king approved. However, he had just died in 1579; the
   moment should have been ideal for El Greco.^[163][27] Through Clovio
   and Orsini, El Greco met [164]Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist
   and agent of Philip; [165]Pedro Chacn, a clergyman; and [166]Luis de
   Castilla, son of [167]Diego de Castilla, the dean of the [168]Cathedral
   of Toledo.^[169][28] El Greco's friendship with Castilla would secure
   his first large commissions in Toledo. He arrived in Toledo by July
   1577, and signed contracts for a group of paintings that was to adorn
   the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo and for the renowned
   [170]El Espolio.^[171][29] By September 1579 he had completed nine
   paintings for Santo Domingo, including The Trinity and The Assumption
   of the Virgin. These works would establish the painter's reputation in
   Toledo.^[172][23]

   El Greco did not plan to settle permanently in Toledo, since his final
   aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his
   court.^[173][30] Indeed, he did manage to secure two important
   commissions from the monarch: Allegory of the Holy League and Martyrdom
   of [174]St. Maurice. However, the king did not like these works and
   placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the [175]chapter-house rather than
   the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El
   Greco.^[176][31] The exact reasons for the king's dissatisfaction
   remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like
   the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene;^[177][31] some
   others that El Greco's works violated a basic rule of the
   [178]Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was
   paramount rather than the style.^[179][32] Philip took a close interest
   in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long
   sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by [180]Benvenuto Cellini also failed
   to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent
   place. Philip's next experiment, with [181]Federico Zuccari was even
   less successful.^[182][33] In any case, Philip's dissatisfaction ended
   any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had.^[183][23]
   [184]The Burial of the Count of Orgaz (15861588, oil on canvas, 480 360
   cm, Santo Tom, Toledo), now El Greco's best known work, illustrates a
   popular local legend. An exceptionally large painting, it is clearly
   divided into two zones: the heavenly above and the terrestrial below,
   brought together compositionally.

[[185]edit] Mature works and later years

   Lacking the favor of the king, El Greco was obliged to remain in
   Toledo, where he had been received in 1577 as a great
   painter.^[186][34] According to [187]Hortensio Flix Paravicino, a
   17th-century Spanish preacher and poet, "Crete gave him life and the
   painter's craft, Toledo a better homeland, where through Death he began
   to achieve eternal life."^[188][35] In 1585, he appears to have hired
   an assistant, [189]Italian painter Francisco Preboste, and to have
   established a workshop capable of producing [190]altar frames and
   statues as well as paintings.^[191][36] On March 12, 1586 he obtained
   the commission for [192]The Burial of the Count of Orgaz, now his
   best-known work.^[193][37] The decade 1597 to 1607 was a period of
   intense activity for El Greco. During these years he received several
   major commissions, and his workshop created pictorial and sculptural
   ensembles for a variety of religious institutions. Among his major
   commissions of this period were three altars for the Chapel of San Jos
   in Toledo (15971599); three paintings (15961600) for the Colegio de Doa
   Mara de Aragon, an [194]Augustinian monastery in Madrid, and the high
   altar, four lateral altars, and the painting St. Ildefonso for the
   Capilla Mayor of the Hospital de la Caridad (Hospital of Charity) at
   [195]Illescas (16031605).^[196][2] The minutes of the commission of The
   Virgin of the Immaculate Conception (16071613), which were composed by
   the personnel of the municipality, describe El Greco as "one of the
   greatest men in both this kingdom and outside it".^[197][38]

   Between 1607 and 1608 El Greco was involved in a protracted legal
   dispute with the authorities of the Hospital of Charity at Illescas
   concerning payment for his work, which included painting, sculpture and
   architecture;^[198][i] this and other legal disputes contributed to the
   economic difficulties he experienced towards the end of his
   life.^[199][39] In 1608, he received his last major commission: for the
   Hospital of [200]Saint John the Baptist in Toledo.^[201][23]

   El Greco made Toledo his home. Surviving contracts mention him as the
   tenant from 1585 onwards of a complex consisting of three apartments
   and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the [202]Marquis de
   Villena.^[203][40] It was in these apartments, which also served as his
   workshop, that he passed the rest of his life, painting and studying.
   He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play
   whilst he dined. It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish
   female companion, Jernima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never
   married. She was the mother of his only son, Jorge Manuel, born in
   1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to
   repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the
   studio.^[204][j] In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave
   birth to El Greco's grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio
   Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the
   artist.^[205][39]

   During the course of the execution of a commission for the Hospital
   Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on April 7,
   1614, he died. A few days earlier, on March 31, he had directed that
   his son should have the power to make his will. Two Greeks, friends of
   the painter, witnessed this [206]last will and testament (El Greco
   never lost touch with his Greek origins).^[207][41] He was buried in
   the Church of Santo Domingo el Antigua.^[208][42]

[[211]edit] Technique and style

   The primacy of imagination and intuition over the subjective character
   of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco's style.^[212][19]
   El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion.
   He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter
   achieves grace only if he manages to solve the most complex problems
   with obvious ease.^[213][19]
   "I hold the imitation of color to be the greatest difficulty of art."
   El Greco (notes of the painter in one of his commentaries)^[214][43]

   El Greco regarded color as the most important and the most ungovernable
   element of painting, and declared that color had primacy over
   form.^[215][19] [216]Francisco Pacheco, a painter and theoretician who
   visited El Greco in 1611, wrote that the painter liked "the colors
   crude and unmixed in great blots as a boastful display of his
   dexterity" and that "he believed in constant repainting and retouching
   in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature".^[217][44]
   [218]The Disrobing of Christ (El Espolio) (15771579, oil on canvas, 285
   173 cm, Sacristy of the Cathedral, Toledo) is one of the most famous
   [219]altarpieces of El Greco. El Greco's altarpieces are renowned for
   their dynamic compositions and startling innovations.

   Art historian [220]Max Dvok was the first scholar to connect El Greco's
   art with Mannerism and [221]Antinaturalism.^[222][45] Modern scholars
   characterize El Greco's theory as "typically Mannerist" and pinpoint
   its sources in the [223]Neo-Platonism of the
   [224]Renaissance.^[225][46] Jonathan Brown believes that El Greco
   endeavored to create a sophisticated form of art;^[226][47] according
   to [227]Nicholas Penny "once in Spain, El Greco was able to create a
   style of his own one that disavowed most of the descriptive ambitions
   of painting".^[228][48]

   In his mature works El Greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to
   dramatize rather than to describe.^[229][2] The strong spiritual
   emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to
   Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly
   careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a
   freedom of style.^[230][44] El Greco's preference for exceptionally
   tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both
   his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard
   the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater
   extents, particularly when they were destined for
   altarpieces.^[231][49] The anatomy of the human body becomes even more
   otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for The Virgin of the
   Immaculate Conception El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself
   by another 1.5 feet (0.46 m) "because in this way the form will be
   perfect and not reduced, which is the worst thing that can happen to a
   figure'". A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the
   interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is
   developed between the two which completely unifies the painting
   surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the
   works of [232]Czanne and [233]Picasso.^[234][49]

   Another characteristic of El Greco's mature style is the use of light.
   As Jonathan Brown notes, "each figure seems to carry its own light
   within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen
   source".^[235][50] Fernando Marias and Agustn Bustamante Garca, the
   scholars who transcribed El Greco's handwritten notes, connect the
   power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying
   Christian Neo-Platonism.^[236][51]

   Modern scholarly research emphasizes the importance of Toledo for the
   complete development of El Greco's mature style and stresses the
   painter's ability to adjust his style in accordance with his
   surroundings.^[237][52] [238]Harold Wethey asserts that "although Greek
   by descent and Italian by artistic preparation, the artist became so
   immersed in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most
   vital visual representative of Spanish [239]mysticism". He believes
   that in El Greco's mature works "the devotional intensity of mood
   reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of
   the Counter-Reformation".^[240][2]
   [241]View of Toledo (c. 15961600, oil on canvas, 47.75 42.75 cm,
   Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) is one of the two surviving
   landscapes of Toledo painted by El Greco.

   El Greco also excelled as a portraitist, able not only to record a
   sitter's features but also to convey their character.^[242][53] His
   portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings, but are of
   equally high quality. Wethey says that "by such simple means, the
   artist created a memorable characterization that places him in the
   highest rank as a portraitist, along with [243]Titian and
   [244]Rembrandt".^[245][2]

[[246]edit] Suggested Byzantine affinities

   Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether
   El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had
   asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition,
   and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the
   art of his ancestors,^[247][54] while others had argued that Byzantine
   art could not be related to El Greco's later work.^[248][55]

   The discovery of the [249]Dormition of the Virgin on [250]Syros, an
   authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the
   extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the
   rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Although following many
   conventions of the Byzantine icon, aspects of the style certainly show
   Venetian influence, and the composition, showing the death of Mary,
   combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox [251]Dormition of the
   Virgin and the Catholic [252]Assumption of the Virgin.^[253][56]
   Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century
   devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work,
   including his supposed Byzantinism.^[254][57] Based on the notes
   written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact
   that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic
   continuity between Byzantine painting and his art.^[255][58] According
   to Marina Lambraki-Plaka "far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral
   place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the
   Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role
   in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his
   mature work".^[256][59] In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka
   disagrees with [257]Oxford University professors [258]Cyril Mango and
   [259]Elizabeth Jeffreys, who assert that "despite claims to the
   contrary, the only Byzantine element of his [260]famous paintings was
   his signature in Greek lettering".^[261][60] Nikos Hadjinikolaou states
   that from 1570 El Greco's painting is "neither Byzantine nor
   post-Byzantine but [262]Western European. The works he produced in
   Italy belong to the history of the [263]Italian art, and those he
   produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art".^[264][61]
   The Adoration of the Magi (15651567, 56 62 cm, [265]Benaki Museum,
   [266]Athens). The icon, signed by El Greco (" ", Created by the hand of
   Domnicos), was painted in Candia on part of an old chest.

   The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco's
   style in the intellectual sources of his Greek-Christian education and
   in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial
   aspect of the Orthodox Church. Davies believes that the religious
   climate of the Counter-Reformation and the aesthetics of mannerism
   acted as catalysts to activate his individual technique. He asserts
   that the philosophies of [267]Platonism and ancient Neo-Platonism, the
   works of [268]Plotinus and [269]Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the
   texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the
   understanding of El Greco's style.^[270][62] Summarizing the ensuing
   scholarly debate on this issue, Jos lvarez Lopera, curator at the
   [271]Museo del Prado, Madrid, concludes that the presence of "Byzantine
   memories" is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still
   some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further
   illumination.^[272][63]

[[273]edit] Architecture and sculpture

   El Greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his
   lifetime.^[274][64] He usually designed complete altar compositions,
   working as architect and sculptor as well as painter at, for instance,
   the Hospital de la Caridad. There he decorated the chapel of the
   hospital, but the wooden altar and the sculptures he created have in
   all probability perished.^[275][65] For El Espolio the master designed
   the original altar of [276]gilded wood which has been destroyed, but
   his small sculptured group of the Miracle of St. Ildefonso still
   survives on the lower centre of the frame.^[277][2]
   "I would not be happy to see a beautiful, well-proportioned woman, no
   matter from which point of view, however extravagant, not only lose her
   beauty in order to, I would say, increase in size according to the law
   of vision, but no longer appear beautiful, and, in fact, become
   monstrous."
   El Greco (marginalia the painter inscribed in his copy of Daniele
   Barbaro's translation of Vitruvius)^[278][66]

   His most important architectural achievement was the church and
   Monastery of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, for which he also executed
   sculptures and paintings.^[279][67] El Greco is regarded as a painter
   who incorporated architecture in his painting.^[280][68] He is also
   credited with the architectural frames to his own paintings in Toledo.
   Pacheco characterized him as "a writer of painting, sculpture and
   architecture".^[281][19]

   In the [282]marginalia that El Greco inscribed in his copy of
   [283]Daniele Barbaro's translation of [284]Vitruvius' [285]De
   architectura, he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological
   remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also
   saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions in order to compensate
   for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms.
   El Greco was averse to the very idea of rules in architecture; he
   believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty,
   variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for
   the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate
   resonance.^[286][68]

[[289]edit] Posthumous critical reputation

   It was a great moment. A pure righteous conscience stood on one tray of
   the balance, an empire on the other, and it was you, man's conscience,
    that tipped the scales. This conscience will be able to stand before
      the Lord as the Last Judgement and not be judged. It will judge,
    because human dignity, purity and valor fill even God with terror ...
    Art is not submission and rules, but a demon which smashes the moulds
   ... Greco's inner-archangel's breast had thrust him on savage freedom's
              single hope, this world's most excellent garret.

   [290]Nikos Kazantzakis, Report to Greco

   The Holy Trinity (15771579, 300 178 cm, oil on canvas, [291]Museo del
   Prado, Madrid, Spain) was part of a group of works created for the
   church "Santo Domingo el Antiguo".

   El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death
   because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the
   early [292]baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of
   the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the
   16th-century Mannerism.^[293][2] El Greco was deemed incomprehensible
   and had no important followers.^[294][69] Only his son and a few
   unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and
   early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but
   criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex [295]iconography.
   Some of these commentators, such as [296]Acislo Antonio Palomino de
   Castro y Velasco and [297]Juan Agustn Cen Bermdez, described his mature
   work as "contemptible", "ridiculous" and "worthy of scorn".^[298][70]
   The views of Palomino and Bermdez were frequently repeated in Spanish
   [299]historiography, adorned with terms such as "strange", "queer",
   "original", "eccentric" and "odd".^[300][71] The phrase "sunk in
   eccentricity", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into
   "madness".^[301][j]

   With the arrival of [302]Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century,
   El Greco's works were examined anew.^[303][69] To French writer
   [304]Theophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European
   Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the
   extreme.^[305][72] Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero
   (the "gifted", the "misunderstood", the "mad"^[306][k]), and was the
   first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later
   technique.^[307][71] French art critics [308]Zacharie Astruc and
   [309]Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in
   his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted
   him as their guide and mentor.^[310][72] However, in the popular
   English-speaking imagination he remained the man who "painted horrors
   in the Escorial" in the words of [311]Ephraim Chambers'
   [312]Cyclopaedia in 1899.^[313][73]

   In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolom Cosso published the
   first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El
   Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.^[314][74] The
   same year [315]Julius Meier-Graefe, a scholar of French
   [316]Impressionism, travelled in Spain, expecting to study Velsquez,
   but instead becoming fascinated by El Greco; he recorded his
   experiences in Spanische Reise (Spanish Journey, published in English
   in 1926), the book which widely established El Greco as a great painter
   of the past "outside a somewhat narrow circle".^[317][75] In El Greco's
   work, Meier-Graefe found foreshadowing of modernity.^[318][76] These
   are the words Meier-Graefe used to describe El Greco's impact on the
   [319]artistic movements of his time:
   He [El Greco] has discovered a realm of new possibilities. Not even he,
   himself, was able to exhaust them. All the generations that follow
   after him live in his realm. There is a greater difference between him
   and Titian, his master, than between him and Renoir or Czanne.
   Nevertheless, Renoir and Czanne are masters of impeccable originality
   because it is not possible to avail yourself of El Greco's language, if
   in using it, it is not invented again and again, by the user.^[320][77]

   To the English artist and critic [321]Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was
   the archetypal genius who did as he thought best "with complete
   indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the
   public". Fry described El Greco as "an [322]old master who is not
   merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us,
   turning back to show us the way".^[323][17] During the same period,
   other researchers developed alternate, more radical theories. The
   physicians August Goldschmidt and Germn Beritens argued that El Greco
   painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems
   (possibly progressive [324]astigmatism or [325]strabismus) that made
   him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the
   perpendicular;^[326][l] the physician Arturo Perera, however,
   attributed this style to the use of [327]marijuana.^[328][78]
   "As I was climbing the narrow, rain-slicked lane

   nearly three hundred years have gone by
   I felt myself seized by the hand of a Powerful Friend
   and indeed I came to see myself lifted on the two
   enormous wings of Domnicos up to his skies

   which this time were full of
   orange trees and water speaking of the homeland."
   [329]Odysseas Elytis, Diary of an Unseen April

   Michael Kimmelman, a reviewer for [330]The New York Times, stated that
   "to Greeks [El Greco] became the quintessential Greek painter; to the
   Spanish, the quintessential Spaniard".^[331][17] As was proved by the
   campaign of the National Art Gallery in Athens to raise the funds for
   the purchase of Saint Peter in 1995, El Greco is loved not just by
   experts and art lovers but also by ordinary people; thanks to the
   donations mainly of individuals and public benefit foundations the
   National Art Gallery raised 1.2 million dollars and purchased the
   painting.^[332][79] Epitomizing the general consensus of El Greco's
   impact, [333]Jimmy Carter, the 39th [334]President of the United
   States, said in April 1980 that El Greco was "the most extraordinary
   painter that ever came along back then" and that he was "maybe three or
   four centuries ahead of his time".^[335][72]

[[336]edit] Influence on other artists

   [337]The Opening of the Fifth Seal (16081614, oil, 225  193 cm., New
   York, Metropolitan Museum) has been suggested to be the prime source of
   inspiration for Picasso's Les Demoiselles d' Avignon.
   Picasso's Les Demoiselles d' Avignon (1907, oil on canvas,
   243.9  233.7 cm., New York, [338]Museum of Modern Art) appears to have
   certain morphological and stylistic similarities with The Opening of
   the Fifth Seal.

   El Greco's re-evaluation was not limited to scholars. According to Efi
   Foundoulaki, "painters and theoreticians from the beginning of the 20th
   century 'discovered' a new El Greco but in process they also discovered
   and revealed their own selves".^[339][80] His expressiveness and colors
   influenced [340]Eugne Delacroix and [341]douard Manet.^[342][81] To the
   [343]Blaue Reiter group in Munich in 1912, El Greco typified that
   mystical inner construction that it was the task of their generation to
   rediscover.^[344][82] The first painter who appears to have noticed the
   structural code in the morphology of the mature El Greco was [345]Paul
   Czanne, one of the forerunners of [346]cubism.^[347][69] Comparative
   morphological analyses of the two painters revealed their common
   elements, such as the distortion of the human body, the reddish and (in
   appearance only) unworked backgrounds and the similarities in the
   rendering of space.^[348][83] According to Brown, "Czanne and El Greco
   are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate
   them".^[349][84] Fry observed that Czanne drew from "his great
   discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform
   and continuous plastic theme".^[350][85]

   The [351]symbolists, and [352]Pablo Picasso during his [353]Blue
   Period, drew on the cold tonality of El Greco, utilizing the anatomy of
   his ascetic figures. While Picasso was working on [354]Les Demoiselles
   d'Avignon, he visited his friend [355]Ignacio Zuloaga in his studio in
   [356]Paris and studied El Greco's [357]Opening of the Fifth Seal (owned
   by Zuloaga since 1897).^[358][86] The relation between Les Demoiselles
   d'Avignon and the Opening of the Fifth Seal was pinpointed in the early
   1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the
   motifs of both works were analysed.^[359][87]
   "In any case, only the execution counts. From this point of view, it is
   correct to say that Cubism has a Spanish origin and that I invented
   Cubism. We must look for the Spanish influence in Czanne. Things
   themselves necessitate it, the influence of El Greco, a Venetian
   painter, on him. But his structure is Cubist."
   Picasso speaking of "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" to Dor de la Souchre in
   Antibes.^[360][88]

   The early cubist explorations of Picasso were to uncover other aspects
   in the work of El Greco: structural analysis of his compositions,
   multi-faced refraction of form, interweaving of form and space, and
   special effects of highlights. Several traits of cubism, such as
   distortions and the materialistic rendering of time, have their
   analogies in El Greco's work. According to Picasso, El Greco's
   structure is cubist.^[361][89] On February 22, 1950, Picasso began his
   series of "paraphrases" of other painters' works with The Portrait of a
   Painter after El Greco.^[362][90] Foundoulaki asserts that Picasso
   "completed ... the process for the activation of the painterly values
   of El Greco which had been started by Manet and carried on by
   Czanne".^[363][91]

   The expressionists focused on the expressive distortions of El Greco.
   According to [364]Franz Marc, one of the principal painters of the
   [365]German expressionist movement, "we refer with pleasure and with
   steadfastness to the case of El Greco, because the glory of this
   painter is closely tied to the evolution of our new perceptions on
   art".^[366][92] [367]Jackson Pollock, a major force in the
   [368]abstract expressionist movement, was also influenced by El Greco.
   By 1943, Pollock had completed sixty drawing compositions after El
   Greco and owned three books on the Cretan master.^[369][93]
   Portrait of Jorge Manuel Theotocopoulos (16001605, oil on canvas, 81 56
   cm, Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes, [370]Seville)
   The Portrait of a Painter after El Greco (1950, oil on plywood, 100.5
   81 cm, Angela Rosengart Collection, [371]Lucerne) is Picasso's version
   of the Portrait of Jorge Manuel Theotocopoulos.

   Contemporary painters are also inspired by El Greco's art. [372]Kysa
   Johnson used El Greco's paintings of the [373]Immaculate Conception as
   the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master's
   anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's
   portraits.^[374][94]

   El Greco's personality and work were a source of inspiration for poet
   Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II.,
   1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception.^[375][95]
   Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for
   El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute
   to the Cretan-born artist.^[376][96]

   In 1998, the Greek electronic composer and artist [377]Vangelis
   published [378]El Greco, a [379]symphonic album inspired by the artist.
   This album is an expansion of an earlier album by Vangelis, [380]Foros
   Timis Ston Greco (A Tribute to El Greco, ). The life of the Cretan-born
   artist is the subject of the recent film [381]El Greco of Greek,
   Spanish and British production. Directed by [382]Ioannis Smaragdis, the
   film began shooting in October 2006 on the island of Crete and debuted
   on the screen one year later;^[383][97] British actor [384]Nick Ashdon
   has been cast to play El Greco.^[385][98]

[[386]edit] Debates on attribution

   The Modena Triptych (1568, tempera on panel, 37 23,8 cm (central), 24
   18 cm (side panels), Galleria Estense, Modena) is a small-scale
   composition attributed to El Greco.

          For more details on this topic, see [387]Works of El Greco.

   The exact number of El Greco's works has been a hotly contested issue.
   In 1937 a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini
   had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be
   by El Greco. Pallucchini attributed to El Greco a small [388]triptych
   in the Galleria Estense at [389]Modena on the basis of a signature on
   the painting on the back of the central panel on the Modena triptych ("
   ", Created by the hand of Domnikos).^[390][99] There was consensus that
   the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and, therefore,
   Pallucchini's publication became the yardstick for attributions to the
   artist.^[391][100] Nevertheless, Wethey denied that the Modena triptych
   had any connection at all with the artist and, in 1962, produced a
   reactive catalogue raisonn with a greatly reduced corpus of materials.
   Whereas art historian Jos Camn Aznar had attributed between 787 and 829
   paintings to the Cretan master, Wethey reduced the number to 285
   authentic works and Halldor Shner, a German researcher of [392]Spanish
   art, recognized only 137.^[393][101] Wethey and other scholars rejected
   the notion that Crete took any part in his formation and supported the
   elimination of a series of works from El Greco's oeuvre.^[394][102]
   (Domnicos Theotocpoulos) . The words El Greco used to sign his
   paintings. El Greco appended after his name the word "epoiei" (, "he
   made it"). In The Assumption the painter used the word "deixas" (, "he
   displayed it") instead of "epoia".

   Since 1962 the discovery of the Dormition and the extensive archival
   research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey's assessments
   were not entirely correct, and that his catalogue decisions may have
   distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco's origins,
   development and oeuvre. The discovery of the Dormition led to the
   attribution of three other signed works of "Domnicos" to El Greco
   (Modena Triptych, St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child, and The
   Adoration of the Magi) and then to the acceptance of more works as
   authentic some signed, some not (such as The Passion of Christ (Piet
   with Angels) painted in 1566),^[395][103] which were brought into the
   group of early works of El Greco. El Greco is now seen as an artist
   with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate the
   style of early El Greco, some painted while he was still in Crete, some
   from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in
   Rome.^[396][57] Even Wethey accepted that "he [El Greco] probably had
   painted the little and much disputed triptych in the Galleria Estense
   at Modena before he left Crete".^[397][104] Nevertheless, disputes over
   the exact number of El Greco's authentic works remain unresolved, and
   the status of Wethey's catalogue raisonn is at the centre of these
   disagreements.^[398][105]

   A few sculptures, including Epimetheus and Pandora, have been
   attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the
   testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of
   figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four
   drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are
   preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and
   the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The
   Crucifixion.^[399][106]

[[400]edit] Notes

   Timeline of El Greco's life (1541 April 7, 1614)

   [401][USEMAP:c697cb21a568b7393d8a9ea692e03aaf.png]

   a. [402]^^  Theotokpoulos acquired the name "El Greco" in Italy, where
   the custom of identifying a man by designating a country or city of
   origin was a common practice. The curious form of the article (El) may
   be from the Venetian dialect or more likely from the Spanish, though in
   [403]Spanish his name would be "El Griego".^[404][2] The Cretan master
   was generally known in Italy and Spain as Dominico Greco, and was
   called only after his death El Greco.^[405][57]

   b. [406]^^  According to a contemporary, El Greco acquired his name,
   not only for his place of origin, but also for the sublimity of his
   art: "Out of the great esteem he was held in he was called the Greek
   (il Greco)" (comment of Giulio Cesare Mancini about El Greco in his
   Chronicles, which were written a few years after El Greco's
   death).^[407][107]

   c. [408]^^  There is an ongoing dispute about El Greco's birthplace.
   Most researchers and scholars give Candia as his birthplace.^[409][108]
   Nonetheless, according to Achileus A. Kyrou, a prominent Greek
   journalist of the 20th century, El Greco was born in Fodele and the
   ruins of his family's house are still extant in the place where old
   Fodele was (the village later changed location because of the raids of
   the pirates).^[410][40] Candia's claim to him is based on two documents
   from a trial in 1606, when the painter was 65. Fodele natives argue
   that El Greco probably told everyone in Spain he was from Heraklion
   because it was the closest known city next to tiny Fodele^[411][109]

   d. [412]^^  This document comes from the notarial archives of Candia
   and was published in 1962.^[413][110] Menegos is the Venetian dialect
   form of Domnicos, and Sgourafos (=) is a Greek term for
   painter.^[414][57]

   e. [415]^^  The arguments of these catholic sources are based on the
   lack of Orthodox archival [416]baptismal records on Crete and on a
   relaxed interchange between Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic rites
   during El Greco's youth.^[417][111] Based on the assessment that his
   art reflects the religious spirit of [418]Roman Catholic Spain, and on
   a reference in his last will and testament, where he described himself
   as a "devout Catholic", some scholars assume that El Greco was part of
   the vibrant Catholic Cretan minority or that he converted from Greek
   Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism before leaving the island.^[419][112]

   f. [420]^^  According to archival research in the late 1990s, El Greco
   was still in Candia at the age of twenty-six. It was there where his
   works, created in the spirit of the post-Byzantine painters of the
   Cretan School, were greatly esteemed. On December 26, 1566 El Greco
   sought permission from the Venetian authorities to sell a "panel of the
   Passion of Christ executed on a gold background" ("un quadro della
   Passione del Nostro Signor Giesu Christo, dorato") in a
   lottery.^[421][57] The Byzantine icon by young Domnicos depicting the
   Passion of Christ, painted on a gold ground, was appraised and sold on
   December 27, 1566 in Candia for the agreed price of seventy gold ducats
   (The panel was valued by two artists; one of them was icon-painter
   Georgios Klontzas. One valuation was eighty ducats and the other
   seventy), equal in value to a work by Titian or Tintoretto of that
   period.^[422][113] Therefore, it seems that El Greco traveled to Venice
   sometime after December 27, 1566.^[423][114] In one of his last
   articles, Wethey reassessed his previous estimations and accepted that
   El Greco left Crete in 1567.^[424][104] According to other archival
   material drawings El Greco sent to a Cretan [425]cartographer he was in
   Venice by 1568.^[426][113]

   g. [427]^^  Mancini reports that El Greco said to the Pope that if the
   whole work was demolished he himself would do it in a decent manner and
   with seemliness.^[428][115]

   h. [429]^^  Toledo must have been one of the largest cities in Europe
   during this period. In 1571 the population of the city was
   62,000.^[430][28]

   i. [431]^^ El Greco signed the contract for the decoration of the high
   altar of the church of the Hospital of Charity on June 18, 1603. He
   agreed to finish the work by August of the following year. Although
   such deadlines were seldom met, it was a point of potential conflict.
   He also agreed to allow the brotherhood to select the
   appraisers.^[432][116] The brotherhood took advantage of this act of
   good faith and did not wish to arrive at a fair settlement.^[433][117]
   Finally, El Greco assigned his legal representation to Preboste and a
   friend of him, Francisco Ximnez Montero, and accepted a payment of
   2,093 [434]ducats.^[435][118]

   j. [436]^^ Doa Jernima de Las Cuevas appears to have outlived El Greco,
   and, although the master acknowledged both her and his son, he never
   married her. That fact has puzzled researchers, because he mentioned
   her in various documents, including his last testament. Most analysts
   assume that El Greco had married unhappily in his youth and therefore
   could not legalize another attachment.^[437][2]

   k. [438]^^  The myth of El Greco's madness came in two versions. On the
   one hand Gautier believed that El Greco went mad from excessive
   artistic sensitivity.^[439][119] On the other hand, the public and the
   critics would not possess the ideological criteria of Gautier and would
   retain the image of El Greco as a "mad painter" and, therefore, his
   "maddest" paintings were not admired but considered to be historical
   documents proving his "madness".^[440][71]

   l. [441]^^  This theory enjoyed surprising popularity during the early
   years of the twentieth century and was opposed by the German
   [442]psychologist David Kuntz.^[443][120] Whether or not El Greco had
   progressive astigmatism is still open to debate.^[444][121] Stuart
   Anstis, Professor at the [445]University of California (Department of
   Psychology), concludes that "even if El Greco were astigmatic, he would
   have adapted to it, and his figures, whether drawn from memory or life,
   would have had normal proportions. His elongations were an artistic
   expression, not a visual symptom."^[446][122] According to Professor of
   Spanish John Armstrong Crow, "astigmatism could never give quality to a
   canvas, nor talent to a dunce".^[447][123]
