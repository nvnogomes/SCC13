   A Dog of Flanders is a [19]novel about a boy Nello and his dog
   Patrasche, written by [20]Marie Louise de la Rame under the
   [21]pseudonym [22]Ouida in 1872. It is widely read in [23]Japan, and
   has been adapted into several films and [24]anime.

   The story is little known in [25]Belgium, and then primarily because of
   the tourists it attracts to [26]Antwerp. There is a small statue of
   Nello and Patrache at the Kapelstraat (Chapel Street) in the Antwerp
   suburb of [27]Hoboken, and a [28]commemorative plaque in front of the
   [29]Antwerp Cathedral donated by [30]Toyota. This novel was very
   popular in the [31]Philippines and it was dubbed and localized by
   [32]ABS-CBN.

[[38]edit] Plot summary

   In the 19th century, a boy named Nello becomes an orphan at the age of
   two when his mother dies in the [39]Ardennes. His grandfather, Jehan
   Daas, who lives in a small village, [40]Hoboken, near the city of
   Antwerp, takes him in.

   One day, Nello finds a dog who was almost beaten to death and names him
   Patrasche. Due to the good care of Jehan, the dog recovers, and from
   then on, Nello and Patrasche are inseparable. Since they are very poor,
   Nello has to help his grandfather by selling milk. Patrasche helps him
   pull the milk cart that Nello uses to sell milk in the town.

   Nello has a friend, Aloise, the daughter of a well-off man in the
   village. The father doesn't want his daughter to have a poor
   sweetheart. Although Nello is illiterate, he is very talented in
   drawing. He enters a junior drawing contest in Antwerp, hoping to win
   the first prize, 200 francs per year. However, the jury selects
   somebody else.

   Afterwards, his grandfather dies and he is accused of causing a fire.
   His life becomes even more desperate. Having no place to stay, Nello
   goes to the cathedral of Antwerp to see [41]Rubens' [42]The Elevation
   of the Cross, but he doesn't have enough money to enter. On the night
   of [43]Christmas Eve, he and Patrasche go to Antwerp and, by chance,
   find the door to the church open. The next morning, the boy and his dog
   are found frozen to death in front of the [44]triptych.
