   Edward Ellice, Jr.

   Edward Ellice ([9]19 August [10]1810 [11]2 August [12]1880), was a
   [13]Scottish [14]Liberal Party politician.

   He was the eldest son of [15]Edward Ellice, from his first marriage to
   Hannah Althea Grey, the youngest sister of [16]Earl Grey, and was
   educated at [17]Eton College and [18]Trinity College,
   Cambridge.^[19][1] In 1832, he was appointed as Private Secretary to
   [20]Lord Durham for his diplomatic mission to Russia.

   Ellice was an unsuccessful candidate for [21]Inverness Burghs in the
   [22]1835 general election, but was elected to represent
   [23]Huddersfield in a May 1837 [24]by-election. In the [25]general
   election that year he was elected to represent [26]St Andrews Burghs, a
   seat he held until 1880.

   Ellice continued as Durham's private secretary during his term as
   [27]Governor General of the Province of Canada; whilst he was working
   in Canada, his wife was briefly captured during the [28]Rebellions of
   1837. He remained a backbencher throughout his political career, taking
   special interest in the reform of the [29]Poor Laws. He supported the
   idea of "[30]clearance", but viewed indiscriminate forcible eviction of
   the peasantry as "cruel and indefensible" (Spain, 2004).

   He was offered a [31]peerage by [32]William Gladstone in 1869, but
   declined the offer, and retired from Parliament in early 1880, shortly
   before his death. Ellice married Katherine Balfour in 1834.
