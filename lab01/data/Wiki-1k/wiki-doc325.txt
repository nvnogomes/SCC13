[[24]edit] History

   Alan is the [25]consultant [26]radiologist at [27]East Hampton Hospital
   Trust. He is rather pompous, kinky, is prone to [28]stuttering, and is
   one of the most disliked members of staff.

   He is also one of the most important people in the hospital, being the
   head of the Radiology department, attending official meetings with the
   hospital's top-brass. One of the other members of staff that attends
   these meetings is his love interest, [29]human resources director
   [30]Joanna Clore. Alan is totally obsessed with her, and will do
   anything to win her over. Their relationship has had many ups and
   downs, but they have always come back together in the end. The main
   problem with the affair is that although they try to keep it as secret
   as possible, everyone knows about it.

   Alan, however, is not liked by most of the other people in the
   hospital. [31]Mac the surgeon often makes derogatory remarks, many of
   them mocking his moustache. However, the bane of Alan's life is junior
   doctor [32]Boyce. He is one of Alan's many pupils studying at the
   hospital, but Boyce seems to spend most of his time trying out new ways
   to make fun of Alan; from making homosexual remarks to using his
   relationship with Joanna as a weapon, and even buying him for 30p in a
   charity slave auction. Alan's name badge has also been vandalised on at
   least two occasions: Some of the letters in the word "Consultant" were
   crossed out so it read "Cunt". Even as a child, he was bullied at
   school by "Simon 'Shitting' Mason".

   Alan has gone through a lot during his time at the hospital. During one
   low, when Joanna had fallen for Lyndon, the head of IT at the hospital,
   he turned to [33]Christianity for comfort, but left it after Lyndon
   made it clear that he had no interest in Joanna. In the second series,
   his relationship with Joanna was still not going well, and he was
   willing to do anything to seek sexual gratification. During a brief
   period, he was happy at winning a caption competition on the Consultant
   Radiologists International website, an organisation which Alan claims
   to be an "Esteemed member". Joanna became sick of his cheerfulness, so
   she tried to scare him using her [34]dwarf cousin, but Alan was so
   shocked that he beat him to death with a stuffed [35]heron. He also
   writes down everything he does, says and is told. He has been suffering
   panic attacks ever since, but heard from Boyce that they were treating
   the death as suicide. However, just as he and Joanna start celebrating,
   the police arrives. Boyce however helps them escape, and they steal a
   [36]camper van, unaware that Joanna's son, [37]Dr. Martin Dear is with
   them. Alan ends up driving the camper van (almost) over the edge of the
   same cliff where Martin was in a similar accident before. However,
   Martin called the [38]AA on his mobile and were rescued.

   Alan and Joanna go on the run to hide from the police and have to
   resort to stealing food, but accidentally kill three more people during
   their escape: Joanna reverses the camper van into a mechanic, Alan sits
   on a shopkeepers face and [39]suffocates her, and Joanna rubs
   [40]peanut butter into the face of an arresting policeman with a
   [41]nut allergy. Whilst Alan tries to fix the van so it runs on
   [42]alcohol, the van explodes. Alan and Joanna then decide that as they
   don't wish to hand themselves in or (as their alternative plan states)
   move to Spain (because Alan dislikes the Spanish), so they kill
   themselves by walking naked into the sea, although you don't see them
   drown. An alternate ending on the DVD release of the Special shows Alan
   and Joanna clinging to a buoy.

   Outside life at the hospital, he likes going to restaurants with
   Joanna, playing [43]table tennis, playing the [44]sopranino recorder
   and is keen on [45]botany. During the time Mac was in his coma, Alan
   played table tennis against him. However, when Caroline entered, he
   claimed a "Small ping pong man" was playing him and he tried to chase
   after him.

   He is keen on politics, and once stood as an independent candidate in
   an election (policies included "Raising the age for a surgical
   consultancy to 48", "Banning all motorcycles", and "Using Mac's scrotum
   as a purse", which had turned out to be just a quip from Mac.), but he
   was not elected. He hates [46]The Simpsons, [47]BBC Radio 1,
   [48]menstruation, tilting trains, [49]botrytis (a plant disease), the
   [50]metric system and [51]crazy paving. He also claims to be a member
   of [52]Mensa; although Alan's [53]IQ is only 139 and acceptance to
   MENSA requires 147. He can also do several bird impressions, and can
   sing "Baa Baa Black Sheep" in Latin. Alan also has the habit of
   correcting other people's [54]grammar.

[[55]edit] Relationships

[[56]edit] Joanna

   For a long time now, Alan and Joanna have been in some sort of 'secret'
   relationship, and for an equally long time, everyone in the hospital
   has known about it. This has not stopped them from continuing their
   relationship as if it were secret. They often dine out, play games and
   Alan even has names for certain parts of Joanna's body. He calls her
   breasts "Mimi" and "Charlotte", and also calls Joanna's vagina "The
   growler".

   When Joanna starts to fancy Lyndon, Alan tries various ways to stop
   him. However, he fails. At one point, Alan thought that Joanna was
   pregnant with his child. When Joanna both tells him that not only is
   she not pregnant but is also dumping Alan, he is driven almost mad. He
   even ends up stealing a milk float and throwing the contents at passing
   women.

   Alan finds religion a comfort and becomes a Christian. When Joanna is
   dumped by Lyndon however, they soon get back together. Later, they
   drift apart, and Joanna once again tries to see if she can get Lyndon
   to go out with her, but fails. Alan tried to get his own back by
   unleashing a box of flies in her office, but Joanna listened to the
   tape attached to the box before she actually opened the box, leading
   her to discover that the box was filled with flies, and so she had the
   box of flies released into Alan's office.

   During a period when Alan is unusually happy, Joanna tried to make him
   upset again by getting her cousin, who was a dwarf, to paint himself
   green, hide behind Alan's desk, jump out, and scare him. However, Alan
   was so scared he beat him to death with a stuffed heron. Although the
   incident has got them into a heap of trouble, it has also brought them
   together. Joanna even had sex with him, whilst she hid in a cupboard
   and drilled a hole in it. When it looks like they might be discovered,
   Alan and Joanna go on the run and steal a camper van, unaware that
   Joanna's son Martin was in it as well. Season 2 ended with Alan, Joanna
   and Martin in the camper van, the van itself teetering dangerously over
   a cliff. In the special Alan and Joanna had managed to get off the
   cliff top in the van, having dumped Martin. The two went on the run
   from the police together, and managed to kill several other people in
   the process. In the end, they ran out of petrol, and Alan managed to
   blow up the van. The two were last seen holding hands, and strolling
   into the sea together.

[[57]edit] Boyce

   Of all the people that agitate Alan, Boyce comes top of the list. All
   of Boyce's time is devoted to forming new ways to make Alan look
   stupid. Boyce often refers to his affair with Joanna, which often leads
   Alan to stammer, becoming confused, and often cancelling the lesson.

   Boyce often makes homosexual advances towards him, and even managed to
   project a 30 foot holographic image of Alan having anal sex with
   another man. Another similar incident occurred when Boyce bought Alan
   in a charity auction for 30p. He also sends him a helium motorised
   balloon labelled "HOMO".

   As the series goes on, Boyce appears to become friendlier with Alan. He
   tries to help Alan during his attempt to enter politics, he invites him
   to a party to celebrate his promotion, and he even helps Alan escape
   from the police. Boyce realises that he misses Alan when the man
   filling in is meaner than Alan. Alan later rings Boyce from a phone box
   and sings a verse from Lionel Ritchie's "Hello", which causes both of
   them to become visibly emotional. This is the last time we see Boyce
   and Alan. In the scene he tells Boyce that the "Parrot and the Parakeet
   are flying West by moonlight", seemingly alluding to his upcoming
   suicide.

[[58]edit] Mac

   Alan does not get on well with Mac. Like many of the doctors, Mac often
   attacks his pomposity and superiority. They often attack each other's
   hairstyles, Alan mocking Mac's rather feminine haircut, and Mac making
   remarks about Alan's moustache.

   Their main argument arose when Alan had bought a new car, and was
   outraged by the fact that Mac has a parking space right near the
   entrance that he never uses because he rides a motorbike. Alan tried to
   do everything possible to get the space but failed. After confronting
   Mac about it, he makes Mac and Boyce agree to give Alan a much better
   parking space. The car ends up in Alan's office, a joke made quite
   remarkable by the fact that no walls seem to be demolished, or the car
   dismantled. He even went into an operation which Mac was performing.
   Alan pulled out the patient's [59]gall bladder and ate it, but
   regurgitated it back up some moments later.

[[60]edit] Sue

   Alan often visits Sue, mostly to complain about his badge being
   vandalised or to report some other form of abuse. Their relationship
   was not helped when Alan insulted Sue for her view of God that
   comforted her when her mother died, saying that it was wrong and if she
   had read the Bible her mother probably wouldn't have died. Sue normally
   responds by ignoring his request and making him leave. Sue once set
   fire to her desk to make Alan leave, and accidentally set Alan's arm
   alight. Alan ended up running through the hospital setting fire to
   things as he went, and extinguishing his arm by diving into an occupied
   birthing pool.

   In one deleted scene, Alan took his revenge on Sue by urinating in her
   office, claiming that he was, "Doing what you have been doing to me
   metaphorically all these years". Alan was then met by a shocked Sue,
   and a group of Japanese delegates. They mistake him as a mental
   patient, to which Alan then dries his penis on Sue's leg. After looking
   very shocked for a while, Sue dismisses the delegates.

[[61]edit] Other relationships

   Alan is known not to be liked by most of the people in the hospital. He
   once tried to trick Joanna that he was having sex with [62]Dr. Caroline
   Todd, unaware that Caroline was in Joanna's office and heard everything
   over the speakerphone.

   His rivalry with Lyndon, although unfounded as Lyndon does not like
   Joanna, has led him to take several courses of action, including a
   tug-of-war in the staff canteen (which Alan lost, ostensibly for not
   having the right shoes).

   During his time as a Christian, Alan was attracted to the hospital
   chaplin Cordelia Denby, but she showed no interest in him.

   The women in the human resources department are aware of Alan and
   Joanna's affair, and often exploit it, most notably [63]Kim Alabaster
   and [64]Naughty Rachel.

   It is also known that Angela and Guy have their own problems with him.
   Martin too has his own problems with him, as he is currently in the
   camper van with Alan and Joanna as well.
