[[28]edit] Early life

   Jha was born in India. He holds a Ph.D. in electronic and electrical
   engineering from the [29]University of Strathclyde, [30]Scotland. He
   received his bachelor of science degree in engineering from the
   [31]University of Liverpool, England.

[[32]edit] Career

   Before joining Qualcomm, Jha held lead design engineering roles with
   Brooktree Corporation, San Diego, and [33]GEC Hirst Research Centre,
   London, England.

   Jha began his career at Qualcomm in 1994 as a senior engineer with the
   Qualcomm VLSI (very large-scale integration) group working on the
   Globalstar satellite phone, and later on the first 13k vocoder ASIC
   (application-specific integrated circuit), which was integrated into
   Qualcomm's MSM2200 chipset. In 1997, Jha was promoted to vice president
   of engineering, where he was responsible for leading the
   integrated-circuit engineering group. Jha led and oversaw the
   development of five generations of modem and cell site chipsets, both
   digital baseband and RF (radio frequency), and system software. Jha was
   promoted to senior vice president of engineering in 1998.

   In 2002, Jha led the formation of Qualcomm Technologies & Ventures,
   where he managed both the technology investment portfolio and the new
   technology group as senior vice president and general manager. Jha
   became executive vice president of Qualcomm and president of [34]QCT in
   2003. He was named COO in December 2006.

   Jha serves two prominent industry roles in addition to his leadership
   at Qualcomm. In June 2005, he was elected to the board of directors of
   the Semiconductor Industry Association ([35]SIA). Considered to be the
   leading voice for the semiconductor industry, more than 85 percent of
   the industry in the United States is comprised of SIA members. He also
   serves as vice chairman of the Fabless Semiconductor Association, the
   voice of the fabless business model and a group with more than 450
   corporate members.

   Before joining Motorola, Sanjay Jha was [36]COO of [37]Qualcomm and
   president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies ([38]QCT). As COO, Jha was
   overlooking Corporate Research and Development and Qualcomm Flarion
   Technologies (QFT) in addition to his role as president of QCT, the
   chipset and software division of Qualcomm Incorporated.

   On August 4, 2008 it was announced he would be the new CEO for the
   Motorola Mobile Devices business.^[39][3]
