[[46]edit] Plot

   The film takes place for the most part during the tumultuous period of
   1912-1925, the years which include [47]World War I, the [48]Russian
   Revolution, and [49]Russian Civil War, as the regime of [50]Tsar
   [51]Nicholas II was overthrown and the [52]Soviet Union established. A
   [53]framing device, from which the film is narrated, takes place in the
   1950s, though a specific date is not mentioned.
   Julie Christie as Lara Antipova

   The film's framing device involves Police General Yevgraf Zhivago
   ([54]Alec Guinness) searching for the love child of his brother, poet
   and doctor Yuri Zhivago ([55]Omar Sharif), and his mistress Larissa
   ("Lara") Antipova ([56]Julie Christie); Yevgraf believes a young woman
   named Tonya Komarovskaya ([57]Rita Tushingham) working on a dam
   project, (referred to as "The Girl" in the credits) may be his niece.
   Yevgraf narrates the story for her, periodically appearing in it,
   though rarely interacts with any other characters in the flashbacks.

   Yevgraf tells the girl the story of his brother's life. Yuri's parents
   died when he was very youngthe opening scene is the burial of Yuri's
   motherleaving him only a [58]balalaika, and he went to live with the
   GromekosAlexander ([59]Ralph Richardson) and Anna ([60]Siobhn
   McKenna)and their daughter Tonya (played as an adult by [61]Geraldine
   Chaplin), whom Zhivago later marries. Gromeko was a retired professor
   living in Moscow, and so Zhivago is able to enter medical school,
   studying under Professor Boris Kurt ([62]Geoffrey Keen). Though he is
   already a poet of some renown, Yuri does not think that he can support
   himself as a poet and decides to become a doctor: he also believes that
   he should do unquestionably useful work. Lara, meanwhile, lives with
   her mother ([63]Adrienne Corri), a dressmaker who is being "advised" by
   Victor Komarovsky ([64]Rod Steiger), a lawyer with political
   connections, who had also been the friend and business partner of
   Zhivago's father.

   Lara is engaged to Pasha Antipov ([65]Tom Courtenay), an idealistic
   young man, who is wounded by a saber-wielding [66]Cossack during a
   peaceful protest, leaving a conspicuous scar across his cheek which
   would mark him for life. Pasha allowed the wound to scar, partly out of
   machismo and partly because his low social status does not entitle him
   to medical attention. That same evening, Komarovsky had taken Lara to a
   posh restaurant (in lieu of her mother, who is ill) and then seduced
   her.

   Lara becomes more deeply involved with Komarovsky, until her mother
   finally discovers their affair and tries to kill herself by swallowing
   [67]iodine. Komarovsky discovers her and summons help from Kurt and his
   assistant Zhivago, who sees Lara for the first time.

   When Pasha, now a dedicated [68]Bolshevik, tells Komarovsky that he
   intends to marry Lara, Komarovsky tries to dissuade Lara from doing so,
   and then rapes her. Afterward, he points out to Lara that her
   enthusiastic cooperation with the act is proof that she is nothing but
   a slut. In revenge, Lara takes an illegal pistol she had been holding
   for Pasha, tracks Komarovsky down to a [69]Christmas party (where
   Zhivago and Tonya announce their engagement) and shoots him, wounding
   his arm. Kamarovsky insists that she be released and shouts, "Get her
   out of here." Lara is escorted out by Pasha, who had followed her into
   the party, and who then learns of Lara's seduction and infidelity.

   The movie then jumps ahead to [70]World War I. Yevgraf enlists,
   intending to subvert the war effort for the party in order to help
   start the Revolution among a defeated people. Yuri (now married to
   Tonya) and Professor Kurt become medical officers, and Pasha joins a
   volunteer regiment as well, becoming one of the only men that the
   soldiers trust. Pasha is supposedly killed in a battle on the Eastern
   Front, while Lara joins as a nurse in order to look for him as the
   [71]Revolution breaks out and the Russian army begins to desert en
   masse.

   Travelling with a group of deserters, Lara meets Zhivago, who is with a
   column of replacement troops marching to the front. The replacement
   soldiers mutiny, kill their officers, and join the deserters. Zhivago
   enlists the help of Lara to tend to the wounded. The two manage a
   makeshift hospital in a country estate for the remainder of the war and
   are parted at war's end.
   Dr. Yuri Zhivago, as portrayed by the Egyptian actor [72]Omar Sharif.

   Yuri returns to Moscow, finding that his Aunt Anna has died and that
   the Gromeko's house has been apportioned by the revolutionary
   government to accommodate 20 or 30 other people. Yuri meets his son
   Sasha for the first time since the boy was an infant, and resumes his
   old job at the local hospital. Furious that his family is lacking in
   firewood for the family stove, one night Yuri steals wood from a fence,
   where he is spotted by Yevgraf. Yevgrav follows him home, identifies
   himself, and informs Zhivago that his poems have been condemned by the
   government as antagonistic to the new ideology, putting their whole
   family at risk for [73]collective punishment. He helps arrange for rail
   passes for their transport to the Gromeko estate at Varykino, in the
   [74]Urals.

   Zhivago, Tonya, Sasha, and Alexander board a heavily-guarded cattle
   train which includes a detachment of labor conscripts including the
   hot-headed [75]anarchist intellectual, Kostoyed Amoursky ([76]Klaus
   Kinski) and a large contingent of [77]Red Guard soldiers. At one point,
   the train passes through the village of Mink, which has been shelled by
   Red forces commanded by a People's Commander Strelnikov. The cattle
   train later pulls into a rail siding to allow Strelnikov's special
   train to pass, where Strelnikov is revealed to be Pasha. While the
   Urals train is stopped, Zhivago wanders away from the train, listening
   to the sound of a waterfall, and stumbles across Strelnikov's armored
   train sitting on a hidden siding. He is arrested and brought to
   Strelnikov (recognized by him as Pasha) as a suspected assassin. After
   a tense conversation, Yuri reveals that he saw Strelnikov at the
   Christmas party. Strenikov tells Yuri that Lara is alive in the town of
   Yuriatin which is currently occupied by forces of the [78]White Army
   and lets Zhivago go back to his train (and family). A casual comment by
   the guard taking him back to his train reveals that most people
   interrogated by Strelnikov end up being shot.

   Zhivago's family arrives at Varykino but finds their main house has
   been boarded up with a sign indicating confiscation by the Soviet
   regime, a.k.a. "the people". Out of fear of being executed as
   "[79]counter-revolutionaries", they desist from breaking into their own
   house. However, they decide to occupy the smaller guest cottage, which
   had not been confiscated. The family lives a mundane life until the
   next spring, when Zhivago goes into Yuriatin and discovers that Lara is
   the local librarian. The two re-acquaint themselves and begin a sexual
   relationship. Zhivago is torn between Tonya and Lara, until Tonya
   becomes pregnant. Yuri travels to Yuriatin and breaks off his affair
   with Lara, only to be captured and conscripted into service by Red
   partisan troops under Liberius ([80]Gerard Tichy) while riding back to
   Varykino.

   After serving with the Partisans for nearly two years as a medical
   officer, Zhivago deserts, only to find that his family has left Russia
   and emigrated to [81]Paris; he goes to Lara's home in Yuriatin, and is
   welcomed by Lara. The two renew their relationship, but Komarovsky
   arrives one night and informs them that they are being watched by the
   Bolsheviks, due to Lara's marriage to Strelnikov (who is now out of
   favor with the government). Komarovsky offers Yuri and Lara his help in
   escaping, but they refuse; the two go with Lara's daughter, Katya, to
   the Varykino estate, which has been left open and is frozen inside.
   Yuri begins writing the "Lara" poems, which would later make him famous
   but incur government displeasure. Komarovsky reappears, telling Yuri
   that Strelnikov has killed himself while being walked to his execution,
   and that Lara is now in immediate danger. She was left unarrested only
   to lure Strelnikov into a trap. Zhivago scoffs at that, and Komarovsky
   advises him that to the contrary, Strelikov was arrested on the open
   road only five miles from Varykino. Yuri agrees to send Lara away with
   Komarovsky who has been appointed as Minister of Justice in Mongolia,
   but Yuri remains behind.

   Years later, almost an invalid, Yuri returns to Moscow, where Yevgraf
   gets him a hospital job and buys him some clothes. While riding a tram
   to his first day at work, he sees a woman he recognizes as Lara, forces
   his way off the tram, and runs after her. He suffers a fatal heart
   attack in the street; she walks on without seeing or hearing him. Lara
   comes to his funeral, surprised and saddened by his death. Lara had
   become separated from her and Yuri's child when revolution broke out in
   Mongolia, and enlists Yevgraf's help, which is unavailing. After
   looking over hundreds of orphans, she gives up. By that time, Zhivago's
   work has been allowed to circulate due to change in party policy and
   his burial has been widely attended, despite being denied a state
   funeral.

   At the beginning of the film, Zhivago's mother dies (the film opens at
   her funeral) and he inherits her [82]balalaika. His adoptive father
   tells him that his mother had a gift. The theme of artistic talent is
   repeated throughout the film, as Zhivago becomes a poet of great
   renown. At the end of Yevgraf's story, the girl ends the meeting,
   denying that she is Yevgraf's niece, and leaves with her boyfriend.
   When walking away, the girl slings a balalaika over her shoulder, which
   catches the eye of Yevgraf. He asks, "Tonya, can you play the
   balalaika?" The boyfriend responds, "Can she play? She is an artist!"
   After being informed that the girl plays well without having had any
   lessons, Yevgraf says about her talent, "Ah, then, it's a gift." He is
   now convinced that the girl, abandoned in Mongolia as a child, is
   indeed the daughter of Yuri and Lara, thus bringing a coda to the
   framing device.

[[99]edit] Background

   This famous film version by [100]David Lean was created for various
   reasons. Pasternak's novel had been an international success, and
   producer [101]Carlo Ponti was interested in adapting it as a vehicle
   for his wife, [102]Sophia Loren. Lean, coming off the huge success of
   [103]Lawrence of Arabia (1962), wanted to make a more intimate,
   romantic film to balance the action- and adventure-oriented tone of his
   previous film. One of the first actors signed onboard was [104]Omar
   Sharif, who had played Lawrence's right-hand man Sherif Ali in
   Lawrence. Sharif loved the novel, and when he heard Lean was making a
   film adaptation, he requested to be cast in the role of Pasha (which
   ultimately went to [105]Tom Courtenay). Sharif was quite surprised when
   Lean suggested that he play Zhivago himself. ([106]Peter O'Toole, star
   of Lawrence, was Lean's original choice for Zhivago, but turned the
   part down; [107]Max Von Sydow and [108]Paul Newman were also
   considered.) [109]Rod Steiger was cast as Komarovsky after [110]Marlon
   Brando and [111]James Mason turned the part down. [112]Audrey Hepburn
   was considered for Tonya, while Robert Bolt lobbied for [113]Albert
   Finney to play Pasha. Lean, however, was able to convince Ponti that
   Loren was not right for the role of Lara, saying she was "too tall"
   (and confiding in screenwriter [114]Robert Bolt that he could not
   accept Loren as a virgin for the early parts of the film), and
   [115]Yvette Mimieux, [116]Sarah Miles and [117]Jane Fonda were
   considered for the role. Ultimately, [118]Julie Christie was cast based
   on her appearance in [119]Billy Liar (1963), and the recommendation of
   [120]John Ford, who directed her in Young Cassidy.

   Since the book was banned in the Soviet Union, the movie was filmed
   largely in [121]Spain over ten months,^[122][1] with the entire
   [123]Moscow set being built from scratch outside of [124]Madrid. Most
   of the scenes covering Zhivago and Lara's service in World War I were
   filmed in [125]Soria, as was the Varykino estate. Due to uncooperative
   weather in Spain, some of the winter sequences were filmed in
   [126]Finland, mostly landscape scenes, and Yuri's escape from the
   Partisans. Winter scenes of the family travelling to Yuriatin by rail
   were filmed in [127]Canada.

   The "ice-palace" at Varykino was filmed in Soria as well, a house
   filled with frozen [128]beeswax. The charge of the Partisans across the
   frozen lake was filmed in Spain as well; a cast iron sheet was placed
   over a dried river-bed, and fake snow (mostly marble dust) was added on
   top. Most of the winter scenes were filmed in warm temperatures,
   sometimes of up to ninety degrees Fahrenheit.

[[129]edit] Book vs. Film

   The film version of Zhivago is faithful to the book in a general sense;
   the basic plot remains the same, and storywise there are relatively few
   deviations from the novel. However, many of the subplots - particularly
   regarding the novel's historical/political facets - were glossed over
   or edited down. Nearly half of the book's characters were excised while
   others had their parts significantly reduced (particularly Anna
   Gromeko, Pasha, and Liberius the Partisan commander). Other characters
   (most notably Kuril, the Bolshevik deserter, Commissar Razin, and
   Petya, the Varykino groundskeeper) were created as an amalgamation of
   characters from the book which had been excised from the film version.
   Many reviewers have criticized the film in particular for reducing the
   depiction of [130]World War I to a mere five minute narration sequence,
   and a similar treatment of Zhivago's service with the Partisans, which
   took up nearly seventy pages of the novel.

   It should be noted that most of these cuts were made or advocated by
   David Lean; screenwriter [131]Robert Bolt's original screenplay dealt
   with the political/historical aspects of the book in a more in-depth,
   if still abbreviated manner. The scenes of Yuri's service with and
   escape from the Partisans included scenes where Liberius executes
   mortally wounded Partisans. Zhivago's horse, after the escape, is
   killed for food by a group of homeless children, and Zhivago comes
   across a group of children who are, it is hinted, cannibalizing the
   bodies of their parents.

   In the book, Pasha is a revolutionary dilettante and an apolitical
   military leader; his ultimate fall from grace is because he is not a
   true Bolshevik. In the film Bolt depicts him as an activist dissenting
   from hardcore Bolshevik orthodoxy from the beginning. He becomes a
   ruthless individual over the course of the story. Bolt wanted to
   include the book's scene where the disgraced Strelnikov returned to
   Varykino, met with Zhivago, and then committed suicide; Lean, however,
   decided to cut it out, and Strelnikov's fate was dealt with through
   dialogue spoken by Komarovsky.

   The present-day subplot involving Yevgraf's interview of The Girl
   several decades after the story's main events was added as a
   narration/framing device to help move along the story. Omar Sharif
   later joked that it was added to reassure the audience that Yuri and
   Lara would ultimately get together, even though the audience would have
   to wait until two hours into the film for it to happen.

[[132]edit] Reception

   Despite being a huge box office hit, Zhivago also gained a staggering
   amount of criticism from reviewers, largely for its length and
   depiction of the romance between Zhivago and Lara. The preview cut,
   which ran to over 220 minutes, was criticized for its length and poor
   pacing; Lean felt obliged to remove up to 17 minutes of footage before
   the film's wide release, and the missing footage hasn't been restored
   or located. Lean took these criticisms very personally, and claimed at
   the time that he would never make another film. However, numerous
   critics - including [133]Richard Schickel and Anna Lee - defended
   Zhivago, and its box office success allowed Lean to write off his
   critics. Lean made [134]Ryan's Daughter in 1970, then waited until 1984
   to make his final film, [135]A Passage to India (1984).

   Lean's production of Zhivago has stood the test of time. The film left
   an indelible mark on popular culture and fashion, and to this day
   remains an extremely popular film: [136]Maurice Jarre's haunting score
   - particularly [137]Lara's Theme - became one of the most famous in
   cinematic history. Over the years, the film's critical reputation has
   gained in stature, and today Zhivago is considered to be one of Lean's
   finest works and is highly critically acclaimed, along with Lawrence,
   [138]Brief Encounter and [139]Bridge on the River Kwai.

   As with the novel itself, the film was banned in the [140]Soviet Union.
   It was not shown in Russia until 1994.

[[162]edit] Miscellany

   [163]Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please
   [164]relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or
   articles. (December 2008)
     * The inside of the ice palace was composed mainly of specifically
       formed wax.
     * [165]Rod Steiger was on set filming for 12 months.
     * This film grossed more than every other film [166]David Lean had
       directed put together.
     * [167]Alec Guinness and [168]David Lean quarreled frequently on the
       set of this film. According to Guinness, Lean was "acting the part
       of a super-star director" and frequently insulted Guinness's
       performance and him personally. This caused a rift to develop
       between the two and they would not work again until [169]A Passage
       to India almost twenty years later.
     * Most of the exteriors were completely built inside as well to serve
       as interiors.
     * [170]Rita Tushingham filmed her part in two weeks.
     * There is a debate among some fans as to whether the blonde girl
       that Zhivago sees walking on the street at the end is actually
       Lara, or just someone who looked like her. While greater tragedy
       and irony could be reflected in such scene if in fact the girl was
       not Lara, it was in fact [171]Julie Christie who played the girl in
       the scene, and Lara did appear at the funeral immediately
       afterwards.
     * The scene where Zhivago and Lara meet amidst the army deserters was
       a deliberate homage to [172]King Vidor's [173]The Big Parade, which
       Lean cited as one of his favorite films.
     * During the entire filming, David Lean avoided meeting any of the
       actors in the film outside the sets or after the shoot. The reason
       he quoted was that each of those actors had their strong individual
       character and David didn't want their characters to influence his
       vision of the characters in the movie.
