   The social reformer the [9]Lord Passfield, better known as Sidney Webb,
   who served as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs between 1929 and
   1930.

   The position of Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was a British
   cabinet level position created in 1925 to deal with British relations
   with the Dominions Canada, Australia, New Zealand, [10]South Africa,
   [11]Newfoundland, and the [12]Irish Free State, as well as the
   self-governing colony of [13]Southern Rhodesia. In 1947, the name of
   the office was changed to the [14]Secretary of State for Commonwealth
   Relations. When initially created the office was held in tandem with
   that of [15]Secretary of State for the Colonies; this persisted until
   June 1930. On two subsequent occasions the offices were briefly held by
   the same person. The Secretary was supported by an [16]Under-Secretary
   of State for Dominion Affairs.
