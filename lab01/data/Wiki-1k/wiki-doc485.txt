Duke of Manchester

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search
   Kimbolton Castle in 1880, the former seat of the Dukes of Manchester.

   Duke of Manchester is a title in the [8]Peerage of Great Britain. It
   was created in 1719 for the politician [9]Charles Montagu, 4th Earl of
   Manchester. He notably served as [10]Secretary of State for the
   Southern Department. The Montagu family descends from [11]Sir Edward
   Montagu, [12]Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench and [13]Chief
   Justice of the Common Pleas. His son Sir Henry Montagu also served as
   Lord Chief Justice of the King's bench as well as [14]Lord High
   Treasurer of England and [15]Lord Privy Seal. In 1620 he was raised to
   the [16]Peerage of England as Baron Kimbolton, of [17]Kimbolton in the
   [18]County of Huntingdon, and Viscount Mandeville. In 1626 he was
   further honoured when he was made Earl of Manchester, also in the
   Peerage of England. His son, [19]the second Earl, was a prominent
   Parliamentary General during the [20]Civil War but later supported the
   restoration of [21]Charles II.

   His son, the third Earl, represented [22]Huntingdonshire in the
   [23]House of Commons. His son was the aforementioned fourth Earl, who
   was created Duke of Manchester in 1719. He was succeeded by his eldest
   son, the second Duke. He notably served as [24]Captain of the Yeomen of
   the Guard in the administration of [25]Sir Robert Walpole. He was
   childless and on his death the titles passed to his younger brother,
   the third Duke. He had earlier represented Huntingdonshire in
   Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Duke. He was
   [26]Ambassador to France and served as [27]Lord Chamberlain of the
   Household. His son, the fifth Duke, was [28]Governor of Jamaica for
   many years and also held office as [29]Postmaster General between 1827
   and 1830. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Duke. He represented
   [30]Huntingdon in the House of Commons as a [31]Tory.

   His eldest son, the seventh Duke, was [32]Conservative Member of
   Parliament for [33]Bewdley and Huntingdonshire. His son, the eighth
   Duke, briefly represented Huntingdonshire in Parliament. He was
   succeeded by his eldest son, the ninth Duke. He sat on the [34]Liberal
   benches in the [35]House of Lords and served as [36]Captain of the
   Yeomen of the Guard in the [37]Liberal administration of [38]Sir Henry
   Campbell-Bannerman. As of 2007 the titles are held by his
   great-grandson, the thirteenth Duke, who succeeded his father in 2002
   (who in his turn had succeeded his elder brother in 1985).

   The [39]Heir Apparent is styled Viscount Mandeville, and the Heir
   Apparent's Heir Apparent (when such exists), in one of only two
   exceptions to the 'rule' that the heirs of Viscounts do not use
   courtesy peerages, is styled Lord Kimbolton.

   The traditional estate of the family was at [40]Kimbolton Castle, but
   the 10th Duke sold it in 1950; it is now a private school, Kimbolton
   School. The current Duke lives in [41]California. The family also used
   to own Tandragee Castle, Co Armagh. They sold it in 1955 and it is now
   the headquarters of Tayto (NI) Ltd, a potato crisp manufacturer.

   Several other members of the Montagu family have been elevated to the
   peerage. The first Earl of Manchester was the younger brother of
   [42]Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton, the ancestor of the
   [43]Dukes of Montagu, and the uncle of [44]Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of
   Sandwich.
