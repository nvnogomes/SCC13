   Dwight Kurt Schrute is a [20]fictional character on [21]NBC's [22]The
   Office portrayed by [23]Rainn Wilson. His counterpart in the original
   [24]UK version of The Office is [25]Gareth Keenan. Dwight is the top
   salesman for the [26]Dunder Mifflin Paper Company and has won numerous
   awards for his successes, despite lacking social skills and common
   sense.^[27][1] Additionally, despite his personal dislike of [28]Jim
   Halpert, the two have been shown to be a very effective sales
   team.^[29][1] Dwight's ability as a salesman, though, has rarely
   commanded the respect of his peers or led to higher levels of
   professional success. He is a physically imposing man at 6 feet
   3 inches (1.9 m)^[30][2] with little, if any, sense of humor.

   In an episode commentary on the season-one DVD, Wilson refers to Dwight
   as a "[31]fascist [32]nerd."^[33][3] In a featurette on the
   season-three DVD, Wilson describes Dwight as "someone who does not hate
   the system, but has a deep and abiding love for it".^[34][4]

   Dwight is a former volunteer sheriff.^[35][5] He has been trained in
   the art of [36]surveillance.^[37][5] He enjoys [38]Battlestar
   Galactica, the "[39]Harry Potter" franchise, [40]The Lord of the Rings,
   [41]Star Wars and [42]Lost. Dwight lives on his family's 60-acre
   (240,000 m^2) beet farm, in a nine bedroom farmhouse (with one
   bathroom), with his cousin Mose (played by producer/writer [43]Michael
   Schur), where they grow beets.^[44][6] Dwight also likes [45]paintball
   and [46]Karate^[47][7] and many weapons. Not much is revealed about
   Dwight's parents except that his father used to take him hunting, and
   also that his father battled cancer.^[48][8] Dwight once mentioned that
   his grandfather fought in WWII and ended up in an [49]Allied [50]Prison
   Camp.^[51][8]

[[66]edit] Casting

   Further information: [67]Rainn Wilson
   Actor [68]Rainn Wilson, who portrays Dwight Schrute.

   Dwight Schrute is portrayed by American actor [69]Rainn Wilson. The
   character is based on [70]Gareth Keenan of the [71]original British
   version of the show, who was played by actor [72]Mackenzie Crook. On
   February 24, 2007, Wilson hosted [73]Saturday Night Live, becoming the
   second cast member from The Office to host after [74]Steve
   Carell.^[75][9]

   All original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. Rainn
   Wilson had watched every episode of the original British series before
   he auditioned for the show.^[76][3] Wilson had originally auditioned
   for Michael, a performance he described as a "terrible [77][Ricky]
   Gervais impersonation";^[78][3] however, the casting directors liked
   his audition as Dwight much more and hired him for the role. Wilson
   based Dwight's hairstyle on his own style he had when he was
   sixteen.^[79][3] In an interview he said that he went to a barber to
   get "the worst haircut possible."^[80][10]

[[81]edit] Character information

   When the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a salesman at the
   [82]Scranton branch of the paper-goods distribution company [83]Dunder
   Mifflin. Dwight formally held the title of "Assistant to the Regional
   Manager"^[84][11] but constantly refers to himself as "Assistant
   Regional Manager," attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command
   to [85]Michael Scott. Dwight craves authority over others and relishes
   any minor task that Michael or anyone else gives him.^[86][3] Though
   Dwight acts like a know-it-all, he is actually quite gullible and
   nave.^[87][3] For this reason, he is easily tricked and tormented by
   his desk-mate and fellow salesman [88]Jim Halpert.^[89][12] Dwight
   speaks in a halting, dramatic manner, even in casual
   conversations.^[90][3] Dwight almost always wears a beige short-sleeved
   dress shirt with a dark tie, often with a brown suit jacket. A running
   joke on the show is to refer to the color of Dwight's shirt on a
   particular occasion as a particular shade of "mustard".

[[91]edit] Family and childhood

   Dwight was a twin, but he "resorbed" his twin while still in his
   mother's womb (this occurrence is called [92]chimerism).^[93][13] He
   believes that he now has "the strength of a grown man and a little
   baby".^[94][13]He says he performed his own circumcision as a child. He
   claims to have been born weighing 13 lb 5 oz (6.0 kg), rendering his
   mother incapable of walking for three months and two days.^[95][13]
   Dwight was shunned by his family between the ages of four and six for
   forgetting to save the excess oil from a can of tuna.^[96][14] He lost
   a grade school spelling bee by misspelling the word "failure" in front
   of the entire school, and subsequently lost the spelling bee to Raj
   Patel.^[97][15] In seventh grade, Dwight played the invented role of
   "Mutey the Mailman" in a production of [98]Oklahoma!.^[99][16] He
   explains that there were not enough roles for all of the children, so
   they made up roles.^[100][16] Dwight's father also named Dwight Schrute
   battled high blood pressure and obesity all his life, but often went
   hunting with his son.^[101][17] In the Season Two DVD bloopers it is
   revealed that Dwight's father would take him and his brothers to a
   swimming hole on hot summer days as a child until 10:00 AM, then they
   would work the beet fields until well after midnight.^[102][8]

   Dwight's maternal grandfather, whose surname is Manheim (according to
   Dwight's web log on [103]NBC.com),^[104][18] fought in [105]World War
   II and killed twenty men before ending up in an [106]Allied [107]prison
   camp.^[108][7] In "Take Your Daughter to Work Day", Michael refers to
   Dwight's grandmother as a "Nazi war criminal".^[109][19] In
   "[110]Dunder Mifflin Infinity", Dwight reveals that Grandpa Manheim is
   still alive at 103-years old, and relates his attempt to visit him in
   [111]Argentina.^[112][20] His travel visa was protested by the
   [113]Shoah Foundation.^[114][20]

   Dwight's paternal great-grandfather, Dweide Schrude, was
   [115]Amish.^[116][17] In "[117]Casino Night", Dwight arrived at the
   event wearing the tuxedo in which his grandfather was buried. A coffin
   is seen in the barn on the Schrute family farm.^[118][21] In
   "[119]Grief Counseling", Dwight said that his grandfather was reburied
   in an old oil drum.^[120][13]

   Dwight has German roots. In the Episode "Money" he answers the phone
   with, "Schrute Farms, Guten Tag", German for "Good day". He ends the
   call with "Auf Wiedersehen", (Goodbye). In the episode where Jim links
   up Dwight's cellphone to his own Bluetooth headset, Jim says "Hello,
   Mutter. Good news, I've married. Tell Vater." Mutter is the German word
   for mother and Vater means father. Additionally, in "Night Out", Dwight
   begins to sing Ryan a lullaby in German. Also, in a deleted scene from
   "The Surplus" Dwight remarks that half his family arrived in America on
   a [121]U-boat.

   According to one of Dwight's web logs on NBC.com's "Schrute-Space," he
   had an uncle named Gunther, a goat farmer, who fled the Allied invasion
   of Germany and married a Finnish woman with whom he had 17
   children.^[122][22] He also had an Uncle Grit who revealed that the
   Schrute family has an ongoing hatred of [123]Harry S Truman because
   they were staunch supporters of [124]Thomas Dewey. In another blog, he
   mentions a cousin named Heindl, who lost 12% of the hearing in her left
   ear because of a [125]ninja.^[126][23] In a deleted scene from the
   third season episode, [127]Gay Witch Hunt, Dwight reveals he had an
   uncle, Harvey, who worked at [128]Hershey Chocolate in [129]Hershey,
   Pennsylvania as a [130]fudge packer, and he himself worked there as an
   intern one summer.^[131][24]

   Dwight lives in a nine-bedroom, one-bathroom (which is located under
   the porch as revealed in "[132]Office Olympics"), farmhouse on his
   family's 60-acre (240,000 m^2) [133]beet farm with his cousin
   [134]Mose, selling beets to local stores, restaurants and roadside beet
   stands.^[135][25] It is also revealed that Dwight uses part of his farm
   to grow [136]hemp, which a pizza delivery boy refers to as "crappy
   [137]weed."^[138][26] Teenagers have been known to use the farm for
   sex.^[139][6] Dwight and Mose have also turned Schrute Farm into a very
   ramshackle bed & breakfast that was visited during "[140]Money" by Jim
   and Pam.^[141][27] The bed and breakfast had three theme rooms,
   "America, Nighttime, and Irrigation". Jim and Pam stayed in the
   Irrigation Room which had many pipe fittings for decoration.^[142][27]

[[143]edit] Interests

   Dwight is trained in the art of [144]surveillance and is a former
   [145]Lackawanna County [146]volunteer [147]sheriff's deputy.^[148][5]
   He is also a purple belt in [149]Goju-Ryu karate.^[150][7] Dwight is a
   [151]pop culture and [152]sci-fi buff who has expressed fanship of many
   sci-fi movies and popular TV shows. In the episode "[153]The Fire", he
   referenced the movie [154]The Crow as being his favorite. He hints at
   belief in fictional creatures such as [155]androids and [156]zombies.
   He enjoys playing ping-pong and states that many of his heroes are
   table tennis players.^[157][28] He is also shown to be very good at the
   sport.^[158][28] His musical tastes vary, but classic rock seems to be
   a recurring theme.^[159][1] His personal musical talents are not
   lacking, as he plays guitar and recorder, and sings.^[160][19] He has a
   fascination with cars; he usually checks a car's suspension, especially
   muscle cars. He is technologically talented and shows a passion for the
   online role playing game, [161]Second Life, in which the only
   difference between himself and his avatar is that his avatar can
   fly.^[162][26]

   Dwight expresses his interests in weaponry and surveillance.

   Dwight owns an impressive array of weaponry. In addition to laser tag
   and paintball equipment, he has a [164]crossbow range at his farm
   ("[165]Office Olympics"), hinted that he may bring a [166]bo staff to
   work when he is named official security supervisor of the Scranton
   branch.^[167][5] He maintained a hidden arsenal of weapons at his desk,
   including [168]pepper spray, [169]nunchucks, [170]throwing stars, a
   [171]stun gun, a [172]boomerang, [173]handcuffs, a [174]nightstick, a
   pair of [175]brass knuckles, and a [176]samurai sword, all of which
   were confiscated.^[177][29] Dwight also claimed to have sat at his desk
   for an entire day with a Spud Gun without any trouble from
   security.^[178][5] Dwight also uses a real gun, a [179]Smith & Wesson
   Model 686, fired within city limits, to start off the race in Fun
   Run.^[180][30] He also produced a disturbing amount of [181]Molotov
   cocktails for a [182]panty raid on Utica in "[183]Branch Wars". In
   "[184]Survivor Man", it is revealed that Dwight still has many knives
   (and other weapons) strategically positioned throughout the office
   ('Mr. A Knife' in a filing cabinet and water cooler, sword in ceiling
   tile, blow dart in a toilet) and he even owns a .22 rifle with
   scope.^[185][31]

   Dwight is vocal about his views on justice. In "The Negotiation,"
   [186]Roy attacks Jim because he kissed Roy's fiancee, [187]Pam, but
   Dwight intercepts the attack with pepper spray.^[188][29] Jim wants to
   show his appreciation, but Dwight refuses to accept his gifts:
   "Citizens do not accept gifts for being citizens."^[189][29] In
   [190]"Drug Testing," Dwight finds half of a joint in the parking lot,
   which incites him to carry out a full-out investigation.^[191][5] When
   he discovers that Michael might have been exposed to drugs at a concert
   he substitutes his own urine during the drug test.^[192][5] Dwight then
   resigns from his volunteer position at the Sheriff's Department because
   he feels he is no longer worthy of working there. In "[193]Frame Toby",
   Dwight states that he is good at framing people and animals, saying
   that he once framed a [194]raccoon for opening a Christmas present and
   a bear for eating out of the garbage. ^[195][5]

   Dwight claims expertise with children and birth, stating that he
   performed his own circumcision.

[[196]edit] Coworker relations

   Inexplicably, Dwight worships his boss, viewing him as a model for
   success, and often jumps in on Michael's ill-conceived
   schemes.^[197][3] He craves authority, and is thrilled when asked to
   handle any task given to him.^[198][3] He has also been known to assume
   authority even when it is not handed to him.^[199][3] Dwight does seem
   to understand sometimes that Michael views him with a large dose of
   contempt. With the exception of going over Michael's head to vie for
   the manager's job, his loyalty to his boss rarely flags.^[200][3]

   Dwight feels threatened by [201]Ryan, to whom Michael often assigns
   personal tasks, and he continues to resent Ryan, a temp, throughout the
   second season, often addressing him as "Temp,"^[202][11] even after
   Ryan took Jim's job.^[203][20] In the beginning of season 2, Dwight's
   friendship with Michael was slightly torn during one of the episodes
   when Michael must evaluate Ryan.^[204][32] Dwight has been cautious
   ever since.

   In Season One and the beginning of Season Two, Dwight has a mild crush
   on Kelly. In a "[205]Diversity Day" exercise, he lists [206]Caucasian
   and [207]Indian as two races he finds sexually attractive.^[208][33]
   Kelly acknowledges their history in a deleted scene from "[209]The
   Job".^[210][34]

   He is frequently the victim of practical jokes by coworkers [211]Jim
   Halpert and [212]Pam Beesly (see [213]Jim's pranks), though he
   frequently remains oblivious to Pam's involvement. As a result of this,
   Dwight and Jim have an ongoing feud that reaches a head in
   "[214]Conflict Resolution", when Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is
   transferred.^[215][35] Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of
   the Year Award,^[216][15] though this is likely due, at least in part,
   to his stealing Jim's largest client.^[217][15] Somewhat surprisingly,
   Dwight was regretful during "[218]Initiation" as he told Ryan he and
   Jim never got along, and since that point and Jim's return from
   Stamford they have generally gotten along better.^[219][6] Jim is
   annoyed when Andy replaces Dwight in the brief time Dwight has quit.
   Jim even consoled Dwight during the painful aftermath of his break up
   with Angela, although Dwight maintains a supercilious attitude towards
   Jim. Dwight did plan to demote Jim from the Assistant Regional Manager
   spot and make his life a living hell during "[220]The Job" but Jim
   mocked his plans and they did not produce any concrete impact on
   Jim.^[221][34]

   Dwight bonds temporarily with Pam during "[222]The Injury" when he
   suffers from a concussion and begins to act friendly towards
   her.^[223][36] However the bond is seemingly short lived, as it lasts
   for that episode only as Pam glumly expected once she realized his
   injury was the reason he was being nice. In "[224]Back from Vacation",
   Dwight shows that he does care about Pam as he gives her a handkerchief
   while she is crying and comforts her despite not knowing she is crying
   over Jim's relationship with Karen.^[225][37] The friendship between
   the two is re-kindled during "[226]The Job" when Dwight secretly makes
   Pam Assistant to the Regional Manager and sincerely thanks her for her
   service.^[227][34] In "[228]Money", after Pam and Jim stay at Dwight's
   family farm, which he turned into a [229]Bed and Breakfast, they write
   a good review about their stay to help cheer up Dwight from his break
   up with Angela.^[230][27]

   As a result of the Scranton-Stamford merger, Dwight loses his number
   two position to Jim and engages in an ongoing battle with new salesman
   [231]Andy Bernard to gain Michael's favor as his [232]right-hand man.
   The struggle comes to a head in "[233]Traveling Salesmen".^[234][1] In
   Season 4, Andy and Dwight work well together as a sales team, but
   Andy's successful pursuit of Angela after she broke up with Dwight has
   annoyed him.

[[235]edit] Relationship with Angela

   Towards the middle of Season Two, Dwight develops a secret relationship
   with [236]Angela Martin. The relationship is hinted at in the episode
   "Performance Review". The couple are caught by the documentary camera
   canoodling in the backyard during Jim's party in the episode "E-mail
   Surveillance".^[237][38] The pair discuss the rearing of children
   during the episode "Take Your Daughter to Work Day."^[238][19] Dwight
   also tries to attack Oscar when he pushes Angela out of his way after
   she makes a snide remark about his homosexuality in the episode, "Gay
   Witch Hunt".^[239][24]

   Pam begins to suspect a relationship between Dwight and Angela in the
   episode "E-mail Surveillance" by observing their interactions,
   suspicions which are strengthened in "[240]The Injury" and "Conflict
   Resolution" and confirmed by "Traveling Salesmen", where Angela
   confides in Pam about her relationship, using code names.^[241][1] Ryan
   discovers the relationship between the two when he overhears a coded
   conversation between the two in the kitchen. Jim discovers the
   relationship while coming out of the office bathroom after quitting
   time to find Dwight and Angela kissing,^[242][29] although he
   unwittingly glimpsed Angela lying in Dwight's hotel room dressed in
   lingerie, when they are at a conference. On most occasions, Dwight and
   Angela will only talk at work in the kitchen, and when facing opposite
   directions.

   In the episode "[243]Fun Run", Angela asks Dwight to care for her sick
   cat, Sprinkles.^[244][30] Instead of caring for the cat, Dwight feels
   it should be put down and feeds it antihistamines until it falls asleep
   and then places the sleeping but not dead cat in Angela's
   freezer.^[245][30] He lies to Angela, however, and tells her that he
   put it in there after it died to contain the smell.^[246][30] Angela
   figures out the truth when she discovers claw marks in her bags of
   frozen french fries.^[247][30] In the episode "[248]Dunder Mifflin
   Infinity", Dwight and Angela go out to eat after work to discuss their
   relationship.^[249][20] While there, Angela decides that she can no
   longer be with Dwight because every time she looks in Dwight's eyes she
   sees Sprinkles cold lifeless body and they [250]break up despite Dwight
   telling her to use an old sales trick and look him between the
   eyes.^[251][20] Dwight becomes depressed in a typically eccentric
   manner and moans in the stairwell at work, but a brief conversation
   with Jim helps him work through it and he becomes his own, somewhat
   difficult, self again, to the obvious satisfaction of Jim and Pam. In
   the fourth season finale "[252]Goodbye, Toby", Dwight is obviously hurt
   when Angela's boyfriend, Andy Bernard, proposes to her.^[253][39]
   Before giving Andy her answer, Angela looks at Dwight to see him
   standing in silence, so she accepts which upsets Dwight.^[254][39] He
   later tells the camera it was his own fault, taking the blame for the
   breakdown of their relationship.^[255][39] However, in the final scene
   of the episode (and the season), coworker [256]Phyllis Vance comes back
   into the office following Toby's farewell party and catches Dwight
   having sex with Angela, strongly indicating a reconciliation between
   the two is very much in the cards.^[257][39]

   In the fifth season Premiere, "[258]Weight Loss", Dwight and Angela
   have resumed a covert relationship, using a storage room in the
   warehouse to have intercourse whenever Angela finds Andy too
   unbearable. In "[259]Business Ethics", it is revealed that it takes
   Dwight nineteen minutes and forty-eight seconds to make love to Angela.
   In "[260]Crime Aid", Dwight once again becomes depressed when Andy and
   Angela have set a date for their wedding. Dwight gives Angela an
   ultimatum: call off the engagement or lose out on him. She ultimately
   says no to him.

   After Phyllis told everyone about the affair, Angela was under pressure
   to tell Andy but when she failed to do so, Michael stepped in and told
   him. A 'duel' between Dwight and Andy took place where both realised
   Angela had been lying to both of them. Angela was left with no one by
   the end of the episode.

[[261]edit] Character reception

   The Dwight Schrute character has had a very positive reception, and is
   often cited as one of the most popular characters on the show.
   According to [262]Entertainment Weekly he is one of the "greatest
   sidekicks."^[263][40] In an [264]ABC News interview with Rainn Wilson,
   the interviewer commented that "Words barely describe Dwight Schrute,
   the suck-up salesman and assistant regional manager of the Scranton
   branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company..."^[265][41] and "Dwight,
   as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout
   characters in television comedy. Dwight is a survivalist geek, a
   student of karate who likes to shoot a crossbow and watch "Battlestar
   Galactica" on television. And he takes himself very, very
   seriously..."^[266][41] [267]E! News commented that Rainn Wilson should
   be nominated for an [268]Emmy Award for his performance of Dwight,
   commenting: "...Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now, Dwight Schrute?
   Oh, only the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed
   the living daylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last
   night. My God, have I missed you, man. Mr. Schrute, you are the reason
   I love my job, my friend. It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man
   such as you that make television a nice place to be on a Thursday
   night. You may just be an everyday citizen who does not accept prizes
   for being a citizen, but you'd best be accepting a supporting actor
   Emmy nod this year, because, hot damn if you don't deserve
   it."^[269][42]

   Another positive review of the character was given by PopMatters, an
   online entertainment news site. The review stated: "One of the shows
   ironies is that Michael and Dwight, hapless though they might be within
   the office or in most social settings, are actually top
   salesmen...Undeterred, or unaware of any of this, Dwight carries on
   with his dreams of grandeur, even instituting a reward system called
   Schrute Bucks for employees who please him during a brief but
   tyrannical reign as branch manager...Dwight approaches sales with the
   same militaristic fervor as everything else in his life, and it pays
   off for him (maybe thats one of the reasons why, when Jim gives Dwight
   one of Benito Mussolinis speeches to deliver when he accepts a sales
   award in Season Two, Dwight delivers it so enthusiastically that he
   gets a standing ovation)..."^[270][43]

[[271]edit] Outside of The Office

[[272]edit] Bobblehead doll

   A Dwight Schrute bobblehead doll.

   In the episode [273]Valentine's Day, Dwight is given a [274]bobblehead
   doll as a Valentine's gift from Angela. When the bobblehead doll
   introduced in the episode was made available, it was a very big hit
   with fans.^[275][44] Following the episode, fans of the show petitioned
   to NBC to make the bobblehead doll available for purchase on their
   online store.^[276][45] NBC responded by creating an initial run of
   4,000 bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately.^[277][45]
   The creator of the show, [278]Greg Daniels, joked that the bobbleheads,
   saying "Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business purpose.
   People who want to manage by consensus can buy six and keep them
   nodding all the time to whatever they say."^[279][45] The item has
   since become the best-selling merchandise on the NBC website, and has
   sold over 150,000 units.^[280][45]

   NBC also auctioned off or gave away two autographed bobbleheads
   autographed by Rainn Wilson on the NBC website.^[281][45] The first was
   won in an auction in which the highest bidder's full bid was donated to
   Rainn Wilson's charity of choice, the [282]Mona Foundation. This is a
   charity in which NBC donates money made from auctioned off memorabilia
   and props from shows and donates the proceeds to children's education
   projects in foreign countries.^[283][45] The second was given away in a
   random [284]sweepstakes drawing in which the winner received the
   autographed bobblehead and a copy of [285]the third season of The
   Office on [286]DVD.^[287][45]

   Another bobblehead that can be seen on Dwight's desk is that of
   Scranton's favorite son, the "Pride of Scranton, Pennsylvania",
   [288]Gerry McNamara, a [289]Syracuse Basketball star.^[290][46]

   In the episode "The Duel" Dwight threw away the bobblehead.^[291][47]

[[292]edit] Resume

   In "[293]Halloween", Jim and Pam uploaded Dwight's resume to
   "[294]Monster.com, [295]Craigslist, and [296]Google."^[297][48] A
   producer actually did create a Monster account for Dwight and uploaded
   his rsum a month before the episode aired. It can be found by employers
   with resume database access who search for salesmen in [298]Scranton,
   Pennsylvania.^[299][49] The rsum stated that he was willing to relocate
   to another state,^[300][49] wanted a salary close to $30,000
   ([301]USD),^[302][49] desired the job title of regional
   manager,^[303][49] was currently "Assistant to the regional
   manager",^[304][49] and had a [305]Bachelor's Degree.^[306][49] The
   posted rsum also stated: "My time spent at Dunder Mifflin was very
   enjoying. I had the opportunity to learn from an experienced and
   talented boss. My branch consistently was one of the top sellers of the
   company..."^[307][49]

[[308]edit] Schrute Farms

   In "[309]Money", Jim refers to a [310]TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed
   and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute
   Farms.^[311][50] Jim and Pam discover that Dwight is running the
   Schrute Farm as an "[312]agritourism" [313]Bed and Breakfast. They
   spend the night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet
   wine-making, and distributing [314]manure. That night, however, Jim
   finds Dwight moaning in depression over Angela. The Trip Advisor page
   said:

   "Schrute Farms is the number one beet-related [315]agrotourism
   destination in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We offer the finest
   accommodations for the casual traveler and/or beet enthusiast. Come
   join us and experience majestic Schrute Farms.^[316][50]"

   Jim and Pam ("JandP2") also posted a review, which can be seen on the
   reviews page. It read: "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan
   beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms
   and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your
   room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and
   the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never
   seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of
   parking! The staffs attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was
   limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye,
   Schrute Farms delivers."^[317][50]

   An angry Angela also put a review up, and mentioned the death of her
   cat as a main cause for the review. It said: "I have to warn people
   about the proprietor of Schrute Farms - he may portray himself as a
   gentleman farmer, but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat,
   Sprinkles! Who knows what he might do to you or your loved
   ones..."^[318][50]

[[319]edit] Vice presidential bid joke

                           External videos
   [320]Rainn Wilson on The Tonight Show discussing the "nomination"

   On the May 7, 2008 episode of [321]The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,
   [322]US Senator and [323]Republican Party presidential nominee
   [324]John McCain joked that Dwight Schrute would be his vice
   presidential candidate choice.^[325][51]^[326][52] [327]Rainn Wilson
   appeared on [328]The Tonight Show on May 14, 2008, and read to [329]Jay
   Leno a list of demands from Dwight in exchange for being vice
   president.^[330][53] Included in this list was being able to pilot
   [331]Air Force One at any time, and only to be addressed as
   "[332]Iceman" while piloting.^[333][53] He also demanded that [334]Jack
   Bauer be immediately promoted to [335]United States Secretary of
   Defense, his [336]bunker to include a [337]foosball table and be
   [338]zombie proof, and that the [339]Secret Service members be armed
   with [340]nunchucks, [341]throwing stars, and
   [342]flamethrowers.^[343][53] Finally, he demanded a flamethrower, an
   [344]Iron Man suit, and that fellow character [345]Michael Scott be an
   "ambassador to Hawaii."^[346][53]
