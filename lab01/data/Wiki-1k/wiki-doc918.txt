   Edward (Eddie) Arnet Johnson (born [26]May 1, [27]1959 in [28]Chicago,
   [29]Illinois) is a retired American professional [30]basketball player
   who spent 17 seasons in the [31]NBA. A sharpshooting 6'7"
   forward/guard, Johnson attended the [32]University of Illinois before
   being selected by the [33]Kansas City Kings in the [34]1981 NBA Draft.
   Johnson would play for the Kings, the [35]Phoenix Suns, the [36]Seattle
   SuperSonics, the [37]Charlotte Hornets, the [38]Indiana Pacers, the
   [39]Houston Rockets, and [40]Greek team [41]Olympiacos (1994-1995)
   before retiring from basketball in 1999. Although his 19,202 points was
   the 22nd highest total in NBA history at the time of his retirement,
   Johnson was never selected to play in the All-Star game nor ever chosen
   for an All-NBA team. In fact, the "awards highlight" of his career
   occurred in [42]1989, when he received the [43]NBA Sixth Man of the
   Year Award as a member of the Suns.

   He also played for one year in the [44]Greek League, with
   [45]Olympiacos in the 1994-95 season. He became a cult favorite with
   the fans for his phenomenal shooting from outside the 3-point line. One
   game in particular established his enduring legend for fans of the
   Thrylos (Legend), when he scored four 3-pointers in the final minutes
   of the low-scoring and tense semi-final of the 1995 [46]FIBA Champions'
   Cup European Final Four against arch-rivals [47]Panathinaikos.
   Olympiacos won that match 58-52, but lost the final to [48]Real Madrid.
   Johnson did, however, taste success in the Greek League where he was
   instrumental in Olympiacos' 3-2 series win over Panathinaikos in the
   Greek playoff finals of 1995. The fifth and vital match of that series
   ended in one of the lowest-scoring games ever, as Olympiacos scraped a
   45-44 victory in a match that caused heart attacks for the fans. In 25
   games for Olympiacos, Johnson totaled averages of 21.1 points per game
   and 4.9 rebounds per game in the 1994-95 season.^[[49]citation needed]

   After his season overseas, he then returned to the NBA and started the
   1995-96 season with the Pacers. He was traded to the Nuggets on
   February 20 1997 where he was quickly released. However, he signed with
   the Rockets for the remainder of the season and then returned to the
   Rockets for the next two seasons. Along with his Sixth Man of the Year
   Award, he is also remembered for hitting the game-winning three-pointer
   as time expired in a 95-92 Rockets win over the Utah Jazz in Game 4 of
   the 1997 Western Conference Finals.

   After his playing career was over, Johnson turned to [50]broadcasting,
   serving as a [51]color commentator for the [52]Arizona State University
   men's basketball team, the [53]WNBA's [54]Phoenix Mercury, and
   currently the Phoenix Suns. Johnson is also an accomplished
   [55]motivational speaker, and he has recently released an instructional
   [56]DVD called Eddie Johnson's Jumpshot and Offensive Skills. Johnson
   is also a regular article contributor to the website Hoopshype.com and
   also enjoys debating his ideas, opinions, and thoughts with his
   readers.

   In 2006, Johnson was mistaken in multiple media reports for [57]"Fast
   Eddie" Johnson when the latter was arrested on suspicion of [58]sexual
   assault of a [59]minor and [60]burglary on [61]August 8. Johnson called
   that day the "worst...of his life" and expressed concern that the case
   of mistaken identity might permanently sully his reputation.^[62][1]
   Johnson expressed to [63]Jay Mariotti of [64]The Chicago Sun Times that
   he is considering legal action against the various news outlets that
   used pictures of him gained from the internet or did not [65]fact check
   his identity against that of Edward "Fast Eddie" Johnson.
