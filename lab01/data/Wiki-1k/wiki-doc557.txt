   The Dutch municipal elections of 2006 were held on [65]March 7,
   [66]2006. About 11.8 million people could vote in 419
   [67]municipalities. Due to local redistricting, 15 municipalities have
   already held elections in January 2006 and 24 municipalities will hold
   elections in November 2006. In some cities, such as Amsterdam, there
   were two elections, for the municipality and for the
   '[68]stadsdeelraden' (borough councils).

[[74]edit] Results

   Official results were announced on [75]March 9, [76]2006 ([77]official
   site). [78]PvdA (Labour Party) obtained the most votes and seats, more
   than making good the losses of the 2002 elections. The
   [79]Socialistische Partij almost doubled in size, partly due to its
   participation in more municipalities than in 2002. [80]CDA, [81]VVD and
   [82]D66 all had noticeable losses, which may in part be caused by
   dissatisfaction with the current national government, of which they are
   the coalition partners. Overall, local parties of the [83]Leefbaar type
   lost out as well after some success during the previous elections.

   The following results are as yet incomplete because 24 of the 443
   municipalities will have the elections in November (due to
   redistricting). In the 419 municipalities of the March elections the
   8861 seats were filled as follows

   It should be noted that, although the above shows the total results for
   the whole of the Netherlands, this has no official effect on national
   politics. It is often seen as an indication for it, but the issues and
   the parties that participate at the two levels don't always coincide.
   For example, SP got almost twice as many seats because they
   participated in almost twice as many municipalities as it did in 2002,
   which will in part explain their success, but even so, they still
   didn't participate in all municipalities, so not everyone could vote
   for them. However, since this comparison is often made, a larger scale
   poll was held, showing that the government parties would have lost 17
   seats in parliament if national elections would have been held on that
   day (with CDA losing 13 seats) and the left wing parties would have
   each won seats; PvdA +7, SP +8 and GreenLeft +2. This is fairly similar
   to the election results and a confirmation of polls showing a possible
   majority (and thus coalition) for the three left-wing parties, which
   would be a first in the Netherlands and may be a reaction to what they
   call the present 'right-wing winter'.

   The 'forgotten winner' (who received little media attention) was
   [97]ChristenUnie (CU), who were allied with [98]SGP in many
   municipalities, but represented the winning part with 420 seats (SGP
   has always had a very steady following). Leader [99]Andr Rouvoet now
   says that this alliance might no longer be a good idea because
   precisely there where SGP refused an alliance because CU had a woman in
   their list was where CU grew. SGP's attitude towards women brushes off
   badly on CU. In keeping with their left-wing Christian nature,
   ChristenUnie was most successful in a band across the Netherlands that
   starts in the south west and largely coincides with the so-called
   [100]bible belt, but ends in the heavily socialist north east.

   D66 has been losing for 12 years now. It seems like they half in size
   every time they participate in a coalition. A national coalition, that
   is, and D66 had done their best to focus the attention on local issues
   to avoid this. In 2005, D66 minister [101]Alexander Pechtold had
   proposed to spread municipal elections to avoid the debates by national
   politicians, which are in part cause of this, but that was stopped by
   coalition partner CDA.

   Media attention before election day was manifested around
   [102]Rotterdam, where the late [103]Pim Fortuyn's [104]Leefbaar
   Rotterdam was a surprise winner in 2002, knocking [105]PvdA out of the
   coalition for the first time since WWII. But now, PvdA even gained more
   seats than they had before 2002, and became the largest party once
   again. [106]Leefbaar Rotterdam came second and has already made clear
   it is not willing to enter a coalition with the Labour party, making
   the formation of a coalition difficult because all other parties are
   small (less than 10% of the votes).

   In these 419 municipalities, percentages of over 30% were reached
   almost only by PvdA (in 64 municipalities, mostly in the northern
   provinces, especially [107]Groningen and [108]Friesland) and CDA (59
   times, mostly in southern provinces). Percentages over 40% were reached
   in 29 municipalities, again almost exclusively by PvdA (12) and CDA
   (10). Absolute majorities (over 50%), which would not require a
   coalition, are a rarity in a parliamentary democracy with
   [109]proportional representation and occurred only twice. PvdA won an
   absolute majority in [110]Winschoten, [111]Groningen province with
   49.7% of the votes and 9 out of 17 seats in the council, and CDA in
   [112]Tubbergen, [113]Overijssel province with 58.3% of the vote and 12
   out of 19 seats in the council.

   Half the people have voted for the person at the top of the list. One
   third have voted for someone they met personally. The enormous rise of
   SP in some municipalities presented several candidates with a problem
   because they have to take a seat in the council but can't combine it
   with their 'normal' jobs.

[[114]edit] Campaign

   Polls showed a major shift in the issues. In 2006, people mentioned
   employment, poverty, traffic, housing and education, largely the issues
   that left wing parties focused on. The issues of immigrant integration
   and safety, which were so important in 2002 and led to the success of
   the [115]Leefbaar parties, played a minor role this time. In Nijmegen,
   with its all-left coalition, people's sense of safety has risen from
   21% to 52% since that coalition came to power, illustrating that this
   is not just a right wing issue. The biggest shift among lower incomes
   was from the [116]Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) to the
   [117]Socialist Party (SP), probably caused by the first two issues.

   A major issue in the campaign of the right wing [118]VVD was to advise
   people not to vote for the [119]social-democratic [120]PvdA. This was
   done in such a manner that PvdA leader [121]Wouter Bos declared the VVD
   had been the best campaigner for the PvdA. He said about the VVD leader
   that "every time [122]van Aartsen opens his mouth, we gain another
   seat".

[[123]edit] Voter turnout

   Voter turnout across the Netherlands was around 58%, slightly more than
   in the 2002 municipal elections. [124]Delfzijl was said to have the
   lowest turnout of the whole country, with 47.3% but this was due to 22%
   of the cast Delfzijl votes being blank, as a form of protest against
   the political mismanagement that entangled the city last year. The
   Delfzijl turnout with the blank votes included was 61.1%. The real
   lowest turnouts were in the major cities [125]Eindhoven and [126]The
   Hague, each with 47.5%. The highest turnouts are traditionally in
   smaller communities and especially at the [127]Wadden islands in the
   North. The highest turnout this year was at [128]Ameland with 87.3%.

   People of foreign origin (known in the Netherlands as [129]allochtonen)
   constitute about 2.2 million of the constituency of 11.2 million. Most
   are of [130]German origin (320.000) and about half of non-western
   origin, most notably from [131]Surinam (225.000) and [132]Turkey
   (220.000). Voter turnout among allochtones was higher than previously
   and many have voted PvdA.

[[133]edit] Aftermath

   [134]VVD [135]fractievoorzitter [136]Jozias van Aartsen announced that
   since his party lost votes, while he had had high hopes to gain some
   (overall outcome for the VVD was less than 14% this time), he will
   retire from the leadership. He will remain in the [137]Tweede Kamer.
   Former party leader [138]Hans Wiegel, who had hinted at returning to
   lead the party in the [139]next general election announced he would not
   seek a return to politics. A likely candidate to succeed van Aartsen as
   political leader is [140]Mark Rutte, the current [141]staatssecretaris
   for higher education and science. He is seen as a representative for
   the more left-wing ('social liberal') side of VDD (although he himself
   denies this), illustrated by the fact that he does not wear a necktie,
   which, he says, illustrates that the VVD is for all people, not just an
   elite group.

   For [142]CDA an important part of the campaign was that regional and
   national politics are two separate things. For this reason, premier
   Balkenende did not participate (much) in the campaign and declared
   after the elections that the CDA would not change its national policy.

   [143]D66 fractievoorzitter [144]Lousewies van der Laan remarked that
   this was the tenth election in a row (over 12 years) that D66 lost
   seats and that this time they would not seek the cause in external
   factors but within the party itself. People no longer know what D66
   stands for. An example was the wavering stance of D66 on the
   [145]Afghanistan mission debates in December and January, first
   opposing it and then going along with it.

[[146]edit] Coalitions

   There used to be a time limit to the duration of coalition talks, but
   that has been dropped, so the formations may take a long time.

   The combination of the three left wing parties PvdA, GroenLinks and SP
   that already formed a coalition in [147]Nijmegen (which was
   consequently nicknamed [148]Havana on the [149]Waal) has gained a
   majority in at least 39 municipalities, mostly in the Northeast and the
   [150]Randstad, including 7 of the 12 largest municipalities and 20 of
   the 60 municipalities with an electorate over 50.000, including
   [151]Maastricht and [152]Heerlen, the two biggest cities in CDA
   stronghold province [153]Limburg. However, although this combination is
   close to 50% of the seats in many municipalities where all three
   participated, a majority is in most cases only just not possible or too
   narrow to be comfortable. The biggest majority was in the small
   Groningen municipality of [154]Pekela (11 out of 15 seats), but also in
   major cities like [155]Amsterdam (33 out of 45), Nijmegen (24 out of
   39), [156]Utrecht (27 out of 45), [157]Groningen (24 out of 39),
   [158]Haarlem (22 out of 39) and [159]Arnhem (23 out of 39) there are
   large majorities for PvdA, SP and GroenLinks. In [160]Reiderland a
   non-left-wing council is not even possible. It is noteworthy that in
   Arnhem, that was often juxtaposed to nearby Nijmegen, such a coalition
   has now also become possible, although the existing very broad
   coalition hasn't lost its majority.
   Another factor here is that the local branches confer with the national
   party because decisions at the two levels have to be harmonised.
   Nationally, PvdA is doing well, but in some municipalities too left
   wing a coalition may not go down well with some people, which may have
   negative effects on PvdA during the 2007 national elections. Also,
   local branches of a party may have a rather different signature from
   the local party, such as in [161]Zaanstad, where the CDA is rather left
   wing. "They're called CDA,but that's where the similarity ends",
   according to a PvdA spokesman. And SP also differs strongly from place
   to place. In some places they are considered decent politicians, in
   others too troublesome (SP used to lean towards [162]Marxism and that
   may not have disappeared everywhere). The subjects of housing and city
   renovation are often points of difference between PvdA and SP.
   In Amsterdam, where this coalition would be biggest, SP have already
   left the talks, but PvdA and GroenLinks still have a majority of 27 out
   of 45 seats. In Arnhem the three parties are talking but there are
   differences between PvdA and SP over how money should be spent (housing
   or redistribution).

   [163]ChristenUnie turned out to be very popular as a coalition partner,
   partly because their stance on social issues often coincides with that
   of the big winner PvdA, who lead the coalitiontalks in most
   municipalities. Where socialist PvdA and Christian CDA form a
   coalition, they often take ChristenUnie on board even when there is no
   need for a majority because, being both left-wing and Christian, they
   form a bridge between those two parties.
   On 4 April CU had already entered a coalition in 21 new municipalities,
   whilst keeping its position in municipalities where they already were
   part of a coalition. They had won 12% more seats but their
   coalition-participation had risen by 69%.

   In [164]Goes, the Christian parties CDA and SGP/CU formed a coalition
   with VVD on the day after the elections ("at record breaking speed"),
   without consulting the PvdA. This led to quite an uproar because it is
   customary that coalition talks are started by the biggest party, which
   was the PvdA. But what was really salient was that this was done on a
   Christian day of prayer for which the elections were shifted forward
   one day (elections are usually on Wednesdays) at the request of SGP,
   one of those new coalition partners. During inauguration hundreds
   gathered in front of the city hall, throwing eggs. The new opposition
   demonstratively left the city hall after the inauguration and a VVD
   member almost attacked a protester.
