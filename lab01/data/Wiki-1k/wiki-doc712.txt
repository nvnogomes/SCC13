Kingdom of Alba

   The Kingdom of Alba ([9]Gaelic: Roghachd na h-Alba) pertains to the
   [10]Kingdom of Scotland between the deaths of [11]Donald II (Domnall
   mac Causantin) in 900, and of [12]Alexander III in 1286 which then led
   indirectly to the [13]Scottish Wars of Independence. The name is one of
   convenience, as throughout this period the elite and populace of the
   Kingdom were predominantly [14]Gaelic, or later Gaelic and
   [15]Scoto-Norman, and differs markedly from the period of the
   [16]Stewarts, in which the elite of the kingdom were for the most part
   speakers of [17]English or [18]Lowland Scots. The article concerns only
   the political history of the Kingdom of Scotland in the [19]High Middle
   Ages, rather than the culture or society of the country.

[[34]edit] Royal court

   Little is known about the structure of the Scottish [35]royal court in
   the period before the coming of the Normans to Scotland, before the
   reign of David I. A little more is known about the court of the later
   twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In the words of Geoffrey Barrow, this
   court "was emphatically feudal, Frankish, non-Celtic in
   character".^[36][1] Some of the offices were Gaelic in origin, such as
   the [37]Hostarius (later Usher or "Doorward"), the man in charge of the
   royal bodyguard, and the rannaire, the Gaelic-speaking member of the
   court whose job was to divide the food.^[38][2]
     * [39]Seneschal or dapifer (i.e. the [40]Steward), had been
       hereditary since the reign of David I. The Steward had
       responsibility for the royal household and its management.
     * The [41]Chancellor was in charge of the royal chapel. The latter
       was the king's place of worship, but as it happened, was associated
       with the royal [42]scribes, responsible for keeping records.
       Usually, the chancellor was a clergyman, and usually he held this
       office before being promoted to a [43]bishopric.
     * The [44]Chamberlain had control and responsibility over royal
       finances
     * The [45]Constable, likewise, hereditary since the reign of David I.
       The constable was in charge of the crown's military resources.
     * The [46]Butler
     * The [47]Marshal or marischal. The marischal differed from the
       constable in that he was more specialized, responsible for and in
       charge of the royal cavalry forces.

   In the thirteenth century, all the other offices tended to be
   hereditary, with the exception of the Chancellor. The royal household
   of course came with numerous other offices. The most important was
   probably the aforementioned hostarius, but there were others such as
   the royal hunters, the royal foresters and the cooks (dispensa or
   spence).

[[48]edit] Kings of Alba

   Further information: [49]Origins of the Kingdom of Alba

[[50]edit] Donald II and Constantine II

   King [51]Donald II was the first man to have been called r Alban (i.e.
   King of Alba), when he died at [52]Dunnottar in 900.^[53][3] This meant
   king of Britain or Scotland. All his predecessors bore the style of
   either King of the [54]Picts or King of [55]Fortriu. Such an apparent
   innovation in the Gaelic chronicles is occasionally taken to spell the
   birth of Scotland, but there is nothing special about his reign that
   might confirm this. Donald had the nickname dsachtach. This simply
   meant a madman, or in early Irish law, a man not in control of his
   functions and hence without legal culpability.^[56][4] The reason was
   possibly the restlessness of his reign, continually spent fighting
   battles against Vikings. Perhaps he gained his unpopularity by
   violating the rights of the church, or through high taxes. We do not
   know. However, his extremely negative nickname makes him an unlikely
   founder of Scotland.

   Donald's successor [57]Constantine II (Causantn mac Aeda) is more often
   regarded as a key figure in the formation of Alba.^[58][5] Constantine
   reigned for nearly half a century, fighting many battles. When he lost
   at [59]Brunanburh, he was clearly discredited and retired as a
   [60]Culdee monk at St. Andrews. Despite this, the [61]Prophecy of
   Berchn is full of praise for the king, and in this respect is in line
   with the views of other sources. Constantine is credited in later
   tradition as the man who, with bishop Cellach of St Andrews, brought
   the northern British church into conformity with that of the larger
   Gaelic world. No one knows exactly what this means. There had been
   Gaelic bishops in St Andrews for two centuries, and Gaelic churchmen
   were amongst the oldest features of northern British Christianity. The
   reform may have been organizational, or some sort of purge of certain
   unknown and perhaps disliked legacies of Pictish ecclesiastical
   tradition. However, other than these factors, it is difficult to
   appreciate fully the importance of Constantine's reign.

[[62]edit] Malcolm I to Malcolm II

   The period between the accession of [63]Malcolm I (Mel Coluim mac
   Domnaill) and [64]Malcolm II (Mel Coluim mac Cinaeda) are marked by
   good relations with the [65]Wessex [66]rulers of England, intense
   internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful
   expansionary policies. Sometime after an English invasion of cumbra
   land ([67]Old English for either [68]Strathclyde or [69]Cumbria or
   both) by King Edmund of England in 945, the English king handed the
   province over to king Malcolm I on condition of a permanent alliance.
   Sometime in the reign of king [70]Indulf (Idulb mac Causantn) (95462),
   the Scots captured the fortress called oppidum Eden, i.e. almost
   certainly [71]Edinburgh.^[72][6] It was the first Scottish foothold in
   [73]Lothian. The Scots had probably had some authority in Strathclyde
   since the later part of the ninth century, but the kingdom kept its own
   rulers, and it is not clear that the Scots were always strong enough to
   enforce their authority. In fact, one of Indulf's successors, [74]Cuiln
   (Cuiln mac Ilduilb), died at the hands of the men of Strathclyde,
   perhaps while trying to enforce his authority. King [75]Kenneth II
   (Cined mac Mal Choluim) (97195) began his reign by invading Britannia
   (possibly Strathclyde), perhaps as an early assertion of his authority,
   and perhaps also as a traditional Gaelic crechrge (lit. "royal prey"),
   the rite by which a king secured the success of his reign with an
   inauguration raid in the territory of a historical enemy.^[76][7]

   The reign of Malcolm I (942/3954) also marks the first known tensions
   between the Scottish kingdom and [77]Moray, the old heartland of the
   Scoto-Pictish kingdom of [78]Fortriu. The Chronicle of the Kings of
   Alba reported that King Malcolm "went into Moray and slew Cellach." The
   same source tells us that king Malcolm was killed by the
   Moravians.^[79][8] This is the first definite sign of tension between
   the [80]Cenl nGabrin and [81]Cenl Loairn, two kin-groups claiming
   descent from different ancestors of [82]Erc. During the reign of
   [83]Macbeth (Mac Bethad mac Findlich), and his successor [84]Lulach
   (Lulach mac Gillai Coemgin), the Moray based Cenl Loairn ruled all
   Scotland.

   The reign of Malcolm II saw the final incorporation of these
   territories. The critical year perhaps was 1018, when king Malcolm II
   defeated the Northumbrians at the [85]Battle of Carham. In the same
   year, King [86]Owain Calvus (the Bald) died, leaving his kingdom to his
   overlord Malcolm. A meeting with King [87]Canute of Denmark and
   England, probably about 1031, seems to have further secured these
   conquests, although the exact nature of Scottish rule over the Lothian
   and [88]Scottish Borders area was not fully realized until the
   reconquest of that province during the [89]Wars of Independence.

[[90]edit] Duncan I to Alexander I

   The [91]Stone of Scone in the Coronation Chair at [92]Westminster
   Abbey, [93]1855. It was the ceremonial coronation stone of Scotland's
   Gaelic kings, similar to the Irish [94]Lia Fil.

   The period between the accession of King [95]Duncan I (Donnchad mac
   Crnn) (1034) and the death of [96]Alexander I (1124) was the last
   before the coming of the [97]Normans to Scotland. In some respects, the
   reign of King [98]Malcolm III (Mel Coluim mac Donnchada) prefigured the
   changes which took place in the reigns of the French-speaking kings
   [99]David I and [100]William I, although native reaction to the manner
   of [101]Duncan II's (Donnchad mac Mel Coluim) accession perhaps put
   these changes back somewhat.

   King Duncan I's reign was a military failure. He was defeated by the
   native English at [102]Durham in 1040, and was subsequently toppled.
   Duncan had only been related to previous rulers through his mother
   [103]Bethoc, daughter of Malcolm II, who had married [104]Crnn, the lay
   abbot of [105]Dunkeld (and probably [106]Mormaer of Atholl too). At a
   location called Bothganowan (or Bothgowan, Bothgofnane, Bothgofuane,
   meaning "Blacksmith's Hut" in old Gaelic,^[107][9] today Pitgaveny near
   [108]Elgin), the [109]Mormaer of Moray, [110]Macbeth defeated and
   killed Duncan, and took the kingship for himself.^[111][10] After
   Macbeth's successor Lulach, another Moravian, all kings of Scotland
   were Duncan's descendants. For this reason, Duncan's reign is often
   remembered positively, while Macbeth is villanised. Eventually,
   [112]William Shakespeare gave fame to this medieval equivalent of
   [113]propaganda by further immortalising both men in his play
   [114]Macbeth. Macbeth's reign however was successful enough that he had
   the security to go on [115]pilgrimage to [116]Rome.

   It was Malcolm III, who acquired the nickname (as did his successors)
   "Canmore" (Cenn Mr, "Great Chief"), and not his father Duncan, who did
   more to create the successful dynasty which ruled Scotland for the
   following two centuries. Part of the success was the huge number of
   children he had. Through two marriages, firstly to the Norwegian
   [117]Ingebjrg Finnsdottir, and secondly to the English princess
   [118]Margaret of Wessex, Malcolm had perhaps a [119]dozen children.
   Malcolm and, if we believe later hagiography, his wife, introduced the
   first [120]Benedictine monks to Scotland. However, despite having a
   royal [121]Anglo-Saxon wife, Malcolm spent more of his reign conducting
   slave raids against the English, adding to the woes of that people in
   the aftermath of the [122]Norman Conquest of England and the
   [123]Harrying of the North, as [124]Marianus Scotus tells us:

   the Gaels and French devastated the English; and [the English] were
   dispersed and died of hunger; and were compelled to eat human flesh:
   and to this end, to kill men, and to salt and dry them.^[125][11]

   Malcolm died in one of these raids, in 1093. In the aftermath of his
   death, the Norman rulers of England began their interference in the
   Scottish kingdom. This interference was prompted by Malcolm's raids and
   attempts to forge claims for his successors to the English kingship. He
   had married the sister of the native English claimant to the English
   throne, [126]Edgar theling, and had given most of his children by this
   marriage Anglo-Saxon royal names. Moreover, he had given support to
   many native English nobles, including Edgar himself, and had been
   supporting native English insurrections against their French rulers. In
   1080, King [127]William the Conqueror sent his son on an invasion of
   Scotland. The invasion got as far as [128]Falkirk, on the boundary
   between Scotland-proper and Lothian, and Malcolm submitted to the
   authority of the king, giving his oldest son Duncan as a hostage. This
   submission perhaps gives the reason why Malcolm did not give his last
   two sons, Alexander and David, Anglo-Saxon royal names.

   Malcolm's natural successor was his brother, [129]Donalbane (Domnall Bn
   mac Donnchada), as Malcolm's sons were young. However, the Norman state
   to the south sent Malcolm's son Duncan to take the kingship. In the
   ensuing conflict, the [130]Anglo-Saxon Chronicle tells us that:

   Donnchad went to Scotland with what aid he could get of the English and
   French, and deprived his kinsman Domnall of the Kingdom, and was
   received as King. But afterwards some of the Scots gathered themselves
   together, and slew almost all of his followers; and he himself escaped
   with few. Thereafter they were reconciled on the condition that he
   should never again introduce English or French into the land ^[131][12]

   Duncan was killed the same year, 1094, and Donalbane resumed sole
   kingship. However, the Norman state sent another of Malcolm's sons,
   [132]Edgar to take the kingship. Anglo-Norman policy worked, because
   thereafter all kings of Scotland succeeded, not without opposition of
   course, under a system very closely corresponding with the
   [133]primogeniture that operated in the French-speaking world. The
   reigns of both Edgar and his brother and successor Alexander are
   comparatively obscure. The former's most notable act was to send a
   [134]camel (or perhaps an [135]elephant) to his fellow Gael
   [136]Muirchertach Ua Briain, [137]High King of Ireland.^[138][13] When
   Edgar died, Alexander took the kingship, while his youngest brother
   David became Prince of "Cumbria" and ruler of Lothian.

[[139]edit] Norman Kings: David I to Alexander III

   [140]Book of Deer, Folio 29v contains a portrait of the Evangelist
   Luke; a list of privileges and legends were written legends in Gaelic
   and Latin in the margins, in lowland [141]Buchan in the reign of David
   I.

   The period between the accession of David I and the death of
   [142]Alexander III was marked by dependency upon and relatively good
   relations with, the Kings of the English. It was also a period of
   historical expansion for the Scottish kingdom, and witnessed the
   successful imposition of royal authority across most of the modern
   country. The period was one of a great deal of historical change, and
   much of the modern historiographical literature is devoted to this
   change (especially G.W.S. Barrow), part of a more general phenomenon
   which has been called the "Europeanisation of Europe".^[143][14] More
   recent works though, while acknowledging that a great deal of change
   did take place, emphasise that this period was in fact also one of
   great continuity (e.g. Cynthia Neville, Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun, and
   others). Indeed, the period is subject to many misconceptions. For
   instance, English did not spread all over the Lowlands (see language
   section), and neither did English names; and, moreover even by 1300,
   most native lordships remained in native Gaelic hands, with only a
   minority passing to men of French or Anglo-French origin; furthermore,
   the Normanisation and imposition of royal authority in Scotland was not
   a peaceful process, but in fact cumulatively more violent than the
   Norman Conquest of England; additionally, the Scottish kings were not
   independent monarchs, but vassals to the King of the English, although
   not "legally" for Scotland north of the Forth.

   The important changes which did occur include the extensive
   establishment of [144]burghs (see section), in many respects Scotland's
   first urban institutions; the [145]feudalisation, or more accurately,
   the [146]Francization of aristocratic martial, social and inheritance
   customs; the de-Scotticisation of ecclesiastical institutions; the
   imposition of royal authority over most of modern Scotland; and the
   drastic drift at the top level from traditional Gaelic culture, so that
   after David I, the Kingship of the Scots resembled more closely the
   kingship of the French and English, than it did the lordship of any
   large-scale Gaelic kingdom in [147]Ireland.

   After David I, and especially in the reign of William I, Scotland's
   King's became ambivalent about, if not hostile towards, the culture of
   most of their subjects. As [148]Walter of Coventry tells us:

   "The modern kings of Scotia count themselves as Frenchmen, in race,
   manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their
   household and following, and have reduced the Scots
   [=Gaels^[[149]citation needed]] to utter servitude"^[150][15]

   The ambivalence of the kings was matched to a certain extent by their
   subjects. In the aftermath of William's was capture at [151]Alnwick in
   1174, the Scots turned on their king's English-speaking and
   French-speaking subjects. [152]William of Newburgh related the events:

   "When the King [William] was given over into the hands of the enemy,
   God's vengeance permitted not also that his most evil army should go
   away unhurt. For when they learned of the King's capture the barbarians
   at first were stunned, and desisted from spoil; and presently, as if
   driven by furies, the sword which they had taken up against their enemy
   and which was now drunken with innocent blood they turned against their
   own army.

   "Now there was in the same army a great number of English; for the
   towns and burghs of the Scottish realm are known to be inhabited by
   English. On the occasion therefore of this opportunity the Scots
   declared their hatred against them, innate, though masked through fear
   of the king; and as many as they fell upon they slew, the rest who
   could escape fleeing back to the royal castles"^[153][16]

   [154]Walter Bower, writing a few centuries later albeit, wrote about
   the same event:

   "At that time after the capture of their king, the Scots together with
   the Galwegians , in the mutual slaughter that took place, killed their
   English and French compatriots without mercy or pity, making frequent
   attacks on them. At that time also there took place a most wretched and
   widespread persecution of the English both in Scotland and Galloway. So
   intense was it that no consideration was shown to the sex of any, but
   all were cruelly killed ..."^[155][17]

   Opposition to the Scottish kings in this period was indeed hard. The
   first instance is perhaps the revolt of [156]engus of Moray, the
   [157]Mormaer of Moray, the crushing of which led to the colonisation of
   Moray by foreign burgesses, and Franco-Flemish and Anglo-French
   aristocrats. Rebellions continued throughout the twelfth century and
   into the [158]thirteenth. Important resistors to the expansionary
   Scottish kings were [159]Somairle mac Gillai Brigte, [160]Fergus of
   Galloway, [161]Gille Brigte, Lord of Galloway and [162]Harald
   Maddadsson, along with two kin-groups known today as the [163]MacHeths
   and the [164]Meic Uilleim.^[[165]citation needed] The latter claimed
   descent from king [166]Donnchad II, through his son William, and
   rebelled for no less a reason than the Scottish throne itself. The
   threat was so grave that, after the defeat of the MacWilliams in 1230,
   the Scottish crown ordered the public execution of the baby girl who
   happened to be the last MacWilliam. This was how the [167]Lanercost
   Chronicle relates the fate of this last MacWilliam:

   "the same Mac-William's daughter, who had not long left her mother's
   womb, innocent as she was, was put to death, in the burgh of Forfar, in
   view of the market place, after a proclamation by the public crier. Her
   head was struck against the column of the market cross, and her brains
   dashed out" ^[168][18]

   Many of these resistors collaborated, and drew support not just in the
   peripheral Gaelic regions of Galloway, Moray, Ross and Argyll, but also
   from eastern "Scotland-proper", Ireland and [169]Mann. By the end of
   the twelfth century, the Scottish kings had acquired the authority and
   ability to draw in native Gaelic lords outside their previous zone of
   control in order to do their work, the most famous examples being
   [170]Lochlann, Lord of Galloway and [171]Ferchar mac in tSagairt.

   Such accommodation assisted expansion to the Scandinavian-ruled lands
   of the west. [172]Uilleam, the native [173]Mormaer of Ross, was a
   pivotal figure in the expansion of the Scottish kingdom into the
   [174]Hebrides, as was [175]Alan MacRuadridh, the key pro-Scottish
   Hebridean chief, who married his daughter to [176]Uilleam, the
   [177]Mormaer of Mar. The Scottish king was able to draw on the support
   of [178]Alan, Lord of Galloway, the master of the [179]Irish Sea
   region, and was able to make use of the Galwegian ruler's enormous
   fleet of ships. The [180]Mormaers of Lennox forged links with the
   Argyll chieftains, bringing a kin-group such as the [181]Campbells into
   the Scottish fold. Cumulatively, by the reign of Alexander III, the
   Scots were in a strong position to annex the remainder of the western
   seaboard, which they did in 1265, with the [182]Treaty of Perth.
   [183]Orkney too was coming into the Scottish fold. In the twelfth
   century, Mormaer [184]Matad's son [185]Harald was established on the
   [186]Orkney Earldom. Thereafter, the Orkney earl (also Mormaer of
   Caithness) was just as much a Scottish vassal as a Norwegian one.
   Descendants of the Gaelic [187]Mormaers of Angus ruled Orkney for much
   of the thirteenth century. In the early fourteenth century, another
   Scottish Gaelic noble, [188]Maol osa V of Strathearn became Earl of
   Orkney, although formal Scottish sovereignty over the [189]Northern
   Isles did not come for more than another century.

   The conquest of the west, the creation of the Mormaerdom of Carrick in
   1186 and the absorption of the [190]Lordship of Galloway after the
   [191]Galwegian revolt of 1135 meant that the number and proportion of
   Gaelic speakers under the rule of the Scottish king actually increased,
   and perhaps even doubled, in the so-called Norman period. It was the
   Gaels and Gaelicised warriors of the new west, and the power they
   offered, that enabled King [192]Robert I (himself a Gaelicised
   [193]Scoto-Norman of [194]Carrick) to emerge victorious during the
   [195]Wars of Independence, which followed soon after the death of
   Alexander III.
