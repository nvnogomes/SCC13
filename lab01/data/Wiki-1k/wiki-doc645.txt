   Edward Joseph Williams was a politician in [9]Manitoba, [10]Canada.
   Born in Brandon in 1918 he was raised in Fort William, Ontario. He
   served in various units of the Canadian army between 1939-1945 and
   obtained his commission at Sandhurst. He served in the [11]Legislative
   Assembly of Manitoba as a [12]Progressive Conservative from 1958 to
   1959.

   Williams was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the [13]1958
   provincial election, in the sprawling northern constituency of
   [14]Churchill. He defeated [15]Liberal-Progressive candidate [16]K.D.
   Wray by 297 votes, in a poll that was deferred until after the rest of
   the province had voted. The Progressive Conservatives won a
   [17]minority government in this election, and Williams became a
   backbench supporter of [18]Dufferin Roblin's government.

   He did not seek re-election in 1959. He later went on to become
   President of the Churchill Chamber of Commerce and obtained brief fame
   by appearing on the CBC National News suggesting that Churchill would
   be much better off as part of the federally governed Northwest
   Territories. He subsequently became Director of Industrial Development
   for the Mackenzie District of the NWT and then worked with the
   Department of Indian and Northern Affairs until his retirement in 1983.
   He now lives in Nanaimo, BC.
