   Dreamwatch was a [17]British [18]magazine covering [19]science fiction
   and [20]fantasy [21]films, [22]books and [23]television programmes.

   Published monthly by Gary Leigh (July 1983 to January 2001) and then
   [24]Titan Magazines (2001 to 2007), it was a leading genre
   entertainment magazine, competing with [25]SFX and Cinescape in the
   genre magazine market.

[[26]edit] Overview

   The publication began life in the early 1980s as an amateur [27]fanzine
   dedicated to the popular [28]science-fiction television series
   [29]Doctor Who, and was published under the title Doctor Who Bulletin.
   In this form, it became well-known for taking a generally critical tone
   towards the later seasons of the programme, particularly the work of
   producer [30]John Nathan-Turner, who was subjected to several personal
   attacks in its pages. However, it became popular with some fans due to
   its frequent reporting of news concerning the show before it was
   released through official sources, and as an alternative viewpoint to
   the officially-sanctioned [31]Doctor Who Magazine. There were, however,
   occasional embarrassing errors, such as the printing of an obituary for
   actor [32]Kevin Stoney in 1986, who was still alive and after the
   article's appearance would happily sign copies for fans at conventions.
   The fanzine also gained a reputation for being sometimes too willing to
   report rumour as fact.

   In 1989, the fanzine expanded to cover other genre films and television
   series as well as Doctor Who, and the title was changed to DreamWatch
   Bulletin so that the popular abbreviation DWB would remain intact. In
   1994, it was turned into a fully-professional newsstand magazine: the
   title was shortened to simply Dreamwatch and the numbering of the
   magazine was restarted from issue 1.

   The original fanzine was founded and edited by Gary Levy, who later
   changed his name to Gary Leigh. He edited the first hundred issues,
   before handing over editorial reins first to David Gibbs (issues
   101-110) and then to Anthony Brown (111-130), after which the
   professional version was launched (with numbering beginning again at
   issue 1, and with Paul Simpson as Editor until issue 71). Leigh
   returned as editor with issue 72, aided by co-editor Simon J. Gerard
   who worked on the title on a day-to-day basis. Leigh retained ownership
   of the title until 2001, when he sold the magazine to [33]Titan
   Magazines, part of the Titan Entertainment Group owned by [34]Nick
   Landau. Gerard moved across to Titan with Dreamwatch and took the role
   of Contributing Editor.

   Brian J. Robb became [35]Editor/Managing Editor in June 2001 (issue 81)
   and continued through to September 2003 (issue 108) which marked DWB's
   20th continuous year of publication. Former Deputy Editor David Bassom
   served as Editor from issue 109 to 123, and launched the stand-alone US
   edition. Robb became Editor/Managing Editor of Dreamwatch once more
   from January 2005 (issue 124) until October 2006 (issue 145). Former
   deputy editor Richard Matthews then became editor for a few issues
   (until issue 148) before the editorship returned to Robb until issue
   150, which was the last print edition, published on 25 January 2007
   (issue 280 if counted from the debut issue in July 1983).

   At the end of January 2007, the magazine became a web-only publication
   entitled Total Sci-Fi, offering SF news and features and Dreamwatch/DWB
   archive at [36]www.dwscifi.com. The website is now edited by Simon
   Hugo, Jonathan Wilkins and Matt McAllister.
