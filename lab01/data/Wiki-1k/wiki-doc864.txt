[[39]edit] Early years

   Kain was born in [40]Hastings, [41]New Zealand, and attended
   [42]Croyden School, [43]Wellington and [44]Christ's College, Canterbury
   studying under Professor Von Zedlitz. While at school he played rugby,
   cricket and excelled at athletics. Kain then worked as a clerk in his
   father's warehousing business. An interest in flying came early, Kain
   joining the Wellington Aero Club and securing his A pilot's licence at
   Wigram in 1936. After earning a private pilot's licence he applied for
   a short-term commission in the Royal Air Force.^[45][2]

   Upon acceptance by the RAF, Kain arrived in the United Kingdom in
   November 1936 and, receiving his short-term commission in December, he
   was enrolled as a pupil pilot at Blackburn, Lincolnshire. After further
   training at Sealand and Tern Hill, he was posted in November 1937 to
   [46]No. 73 Fighter Squadron, then equipped with the [47]Gloster
   Gladiator [48]biplane fighter. In 1938, the squadron converted to the
   new [49]monoplane [50]Hawker Hurricane. Kain was made Flying Officer in
   1939.

[[51]edit] Second World War

   Before the start of hostilities, No. 73 Squadron RAF on 24 August 1939
   was mobilised as part of the [52]Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF).
   Appointed a section commander Kain flew on 80 fighter and escort
   operations over Le Havre, Louvres, Rheims, Verdun and other parts of
   enemy-occupied territory as No. 73 was one of the first units to engage
   the [53]Luftwaffe. Four days after war was declared 73s 16 Hurricane
   fighters flew across the Channel to France.

   On 10 September 1939 Kain flew his first operational patrols without
   making contact with the enemy. His first victory occurred during a
   defensive patrol on 8 November. Kain had spotted a [54]Dornier Do 17 of
   reconnaissance unit 1.(F)/123 above and ahead of him. As the Do 17
   began to climb to 27,000 ft with Kain in pursuit, he made two attacks
   but saw no result. With his Hurricane showing signs of strain, he
   attacked again and the Dornier dived steeply. Kain followed but pulled
   out when he saw fabric peeling off his wings. The Dornier crashed into
   a village North West of [55]Metz, exploding on impact and killing the
   crew.

   On 23 November he shot down another Do 17, of 3.(F)/22 near
   [56]Conflans. Due to bad weather there was little flying in December,
   January and February. On 1 March 1940 Kain fought an action with two
   [57]Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters but his Hurricane was already damaged
   when he shot the first Bf 109 down in flames. The second fighter,
   possibly flown by Oblt [58]Werner Molders of III./JG 53,^[59][3]
   attacked him, hitting the Hurricanes engine with a cannon shell and
   then flew off, leaving Kain to glide in his crippled aircraft 30 miles
   from 20,000 ft to reach French territory. When his engine caught fire,
   Kain prepared to bale out but had to re-enter the cockpit when he
   realized his parachute strap was not in position. Fortunately the
   flames went out and Kain glided on to a forced-landing on Metz
   aerodrome.

[[60]edit] DFC action

   In March 1940, Kain was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for a
   particularly daring action. While flying on operations, he sighted
   seven enemy [61]Bf 109 fighters above him at 5,000 ft. Immediately
   giving chase and while pursuing them back towards the German lines,
   Kain discovered another enemy fighter on his tail. Attacked from
   behind, and with his own Hurricane fighter badly damaged, he engaged
   the enemy and shot it down. With his cockpit full of smoke and oil, he
   managed to bring his Hurricane down behind the Allied lines. The
   citation for the award referred to "the magnificent fighting spirit
   Kain displayed in outmanoeuvring his enemy and destroying him."^[62][4]

[[63]edit] "Phoney War"

   On 26 March Kain destroyed a Bf 109 and probably a second of [64]JG 53
   but then with his own engine on fire he bailed out, with shell
   splinters to his left leg, a bullet-grazed left hand and burns to the
   face.

   Kain went on leave to England on 2 April and before he returned, his
   engagement was announced. Back with the squadron he damaged a
   [65]Messerschmitt Bf 110 on 23 April. During the [66]Phoney war from
   September 1939 to March 1940, Kain shot down five aircraft.

[[67]edit] Blitzkrieg

   On 10 May 1940, the German forces launched the blitzkrieg through the
   Low countries and France; in the next ten days Kain destroyed five more
   enemy aircraft including an unusual Do 17 victory on 15 May where the
   enemy crew (of [68]KG 3)was seen to bale out when Kain had attacked in
   a head-on pass. ^[69][5] and probably destroyed or damaged another
   five.

   On 22 May he was again posted back to England with other pilots but on
   arrival Kain and another pilot were ordered to immediately report back
   to 73 Squadron. They were put on administrative duties and Kain did not
   fly again until 25 May when he destroyed a Do 17 but had to make an
   emergency landing in his damaged Hurricane. He subsequently destroyed
   an [70]Henschel Hs 126 on 26 May and another Do 17 on 27 May. Kain
   continued to fly as his unit retreated from one airfield to the next
   during the Allied retreat to [71]Dunkirk and on 5 June, he shot down a
   Bf 109.

   Officially credited with the destruction of 16 enemy aircraft and 1
   damaged in fighter engagements, Kain was mentioned in dispatches on 27
   February 1940.

[[72]edit] Final sortie

   By 6 June 1940 Kain was the RAF's top ace, and he was informed he would
   be returning to England the next day. The following morning, a group of
   his squadron mates gathered at [73]Bois airfield to bid him farewell as
   he took off in his Hurricane to fly to Le Mans to collect his kit.
   Unexpectedly, Kain began a "beat-up" of the airfield, performing a
   series of low level aerobatics in Hurricane I L1826. Commencing a
   series of "flick" rolls, on his third roll, the ace misjudged his
   altitude and hit the ground heavily in a level attitude. Kain died when
   he was pitched out of the cockpit, striking the ground 27 m in front of
   the exploding Hurricane. Kain is buried in Choloy Military Cemetery.

[[74]edit] Media "star"

   Based on his exploits in the air as well as an engaging, friendly
   manner, "Cobber" (New Zealand slang for "pal") Kain was treated as a
   popular hero by the RAF as well as the media.^[75][1]

   Kain is sometimes incorrectly credited as the first [76]Allied ace,
   (not just RAF), of the Second World War. However, this distinction
   actually went to [77]Stanisaw Skalski of the [78]Polish Air Force.
