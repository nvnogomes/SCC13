[[21]edit] Purpose

   Many electrical installations have a relatively high [22]earth
   impedance. This may be due to the use of a local earth rod ([23]TT
   systems), or to dry local ground conditions.

   These installations are [24]dangerous and a safety [25]risk if a live
   to earth fault [26]current flows. Because earth impedance is high,
    1. not enough current exists to trip a [27]fuse or [28]circuit
       breaker, so the condition persists uncleared indefinitely
    2. the high impedance earth cannot keep the voltage of all exposed
       metal to a safe voltage, all such metalwork may rise to close to
       live conductor voltage.

   These dangers can be drastically reduced by the use of an ELCB or
   [29]Residual-current device (RCD).

   The ELCB makes such installations much safer by cutting the power if
   these dangerous conditions occur. This approach to electrical safety is
   called [30]EEBAD. In Britain EEBAD domestic installations became
   standard in the 1950s.

   In non-technical terms if a person touches something, typically a metal
   part on faulty electrical equipment, which is at a significant voltage
   relative to the earth, electrical current will flow through him/her to
   the earth. The current that flows is too small to trip an electrical
   fuse which could disconnect the electricity supply, but can be enough
   to kill. An ELCB detects even a small current to earth (Earth Leakage)
   and disconnects the equipment (Circuit Breaker).

[[31]edit] History

   ELCBs were mainly used on [32]TT earthing systems. Nowadays, ELCBs have
   been mostly replaced by [33]Residual-current devices (RCDs). However
   many ELCBs are still in use.

   Early ELCBs responded to [34]sinewave fault currents, but not to
   [35]rectified fault current. Over time, filtering against nuisance
   trips has also improved. Early ELCBs thus offer a little less safety
   and higher risk of nuisance trip. The ability to distinguish between a
   fault condition and non-risk conditions is called discrimination.

   ELCB manufacturers include: Legrand, [36]ABB, [37]Siemens AG, [38]Areva
   T&D, TELEMECANIQUE, Orion Italia, Crabtree, MEM.

[[39]edit] Types

   There are two types of ELCB:
     * [40]voltage operated and,
     * [41]current operated.

   Voltage-operated ELCBs were introduced in the early 20th century, and
   provided a major advance in safety for mains electrical supplies with
   inadequate [42]earth impedance. v-ELCBs have been in widespread use
   since then, and many are still in operation.

   Current-operated ELCBs are generally known today as [43]RCDs (residual
   current device). These also protect against [44]earth leakage, though
   the details and method of operation are different.

   When the term ELCB is used it usually means a voltage-operated device.
   Similar devices that are current operated are called
   [45]Residual-current devices.

[[46]edit] Connection

   The [47]earth circuit is modified when an ELCB is used; the connection
   to the [48]earth rod is passed through the ELCB by connecting to its
   two earth terminals. One terminal goes to the installation earth CPC
   (circuit protective conductor, aka earth wire), and the other to the
   [49]earth rod (or sometimes other type of earth connection). Thus the
   earth circuit passes through the ELCB's sense coil.

[[50]edit] Operation

   An ELCB is a specialised type of latching [51]relay that has a
   building's incoming mains power connected through its [52]switching
   contacts so that the ELCB disconnects the power in an earth leakage
   (unsafe) condition.

   The ELCB detects [53]fault currents from live (hot) to the earth
   (ground) [54]wire within the installation it protects. If sufficient
   [55]voltage appears across the ELCB's sense coil, it will switch off
   the [56]power, and remain off until manually reset. An ELCB however,
   does not sense [57]fault currents from live to any other earthed
   [58]body.

[[59]edit] Advantages

   ELCBs have one advantage over RCDs: they are less sensitive to fault
   conditions, therefore they have less nuisance trips. (This does not
   mean they always do, as practical performance depends on installation
   details and the discrimination enhancing filtering in the ELCB.)
   Therefore by electrically separating cable armour from cable CPC, an
   ELCB can be arranged to protect against cable damage only, and not trip
   on faults in downline installations.

[[60]edit] Disadvantages

   ELCBs have some disadvantages:
     * They do not detect faults that don't pass [61]current through the
       CPC to the [62]earth rod.
     * They do not allow a single [63]building system to be easily split
       into multiple sections with independent fault protection, because
       [64]earthing systems are usually bonded to [65]pipework.
     * They may be tripped by external voltages from something connected
       to the earthing system such as metal [66]pipes, a [67]TN-S earth or
       a TN-C-S combined neutral and earth.
     * As with RCDs, electrically leaky appliances such as some [68]water
       heaters, [69]washing machines and [70]cookers may cause the ELCB to
       trip.
     * ELCBs introduce additional [71]resistance and an additional point
       of [72]failure into the [73]earthing system.

[[74]edit] Earth bypassing

   It is not unusual for ELCB protected installation to have a second
   unintentional connection to earth somewhere, one that does not pass
   through the ELCB sense coil. This can occur via metal [75]pipework in
   contact with the ground, [76]metal structural framework, outdoor
   [77]appliances in contact with [78]soil, and so on.

   When this occurs, fault current may pass to [79]earth without being
   sensed by the ELCB. Despite this, perhaps counterintuitively, the
   operation of the ELCB is not compromised. The purpose of the ELCB is to
   prevent earthed [80]metalwork rising to a dangerous [81]voltage during
   [82]fault conditions, and the ELCB continues to do this just the same,
   the ELCB will still cut the power at the same CPC voltage level. (The
   difference is that higher fault current is then needed to reach this
   voltage.)

[[83]edit] Nuisance trips

   While voltage and current on the earth line is usually fault current
   from a live wire, this is not always the case, thus there are
   situations in which an ELCB can nuisance trip.

   When an installation has two connections to earth, a nearby high
   current [84]lightning strike will cause a voltage gradient in the soil,
   presenting the ELCB sense coil with enough voltage to cause it to trip.

   If the installation's [85]earth rod is placed close to the earth rod of
   a neighbouring building, a high earth leakage current in the other
   building can raise the local ground potential and cause a voltage
   difference across the two earths, again tripping the ELCB. Close
   [86]earth rods are unsuitable for ELCB use for this reason, but in real
   life such installations are sometimes encountered.

   Both RCDs and ELCBs are prone to [87]nuisance trips from normal
   harmless [88]earth leakage to some degree. On one hand ELCBs are on
   average older, and hence tend to have less well developed filtering
   against nuisance trips, and on the other hand ELCBs are inherently
   immune to some of the causes of false trips RCDs suffer, and are
   generally less sensitive than RCDs. In practice RCD nuisance trips are
   much more common.

   Another cause of nuisance tripping is due to accumulated or burden
   currents caused by items with lowered insulation resistance. This may
   occur due to older equipment, or equipment with heating elements, or
   even wiring in buildings in the tropics where prolonged damp and rain
   conditions can cause the insulation resistance to lower due to moisture
   tracking. If there is a 30 mA protective device in use and there is a
   10mA burden from various sources then the unit will trip at 20 mA. The
   individual items may each be electrically safe but a large number of
   small burden currents accumulates and reduces the tripping level. This
   was more a problem in past installations where multiple circuits were
   protected by a single ELCB.

   Heating elements of the tubular form are filled with a very fine powder
   that can absorb moisture if the element has not be used for some time.
   In the tropics, this may occur, for example if a clothes drier has not
   been used for a year or a large water boiler used for coffee etc has
   been in storage. In such cases, if the unit is allowed to power up
   without RCD protection then it will normally dry out and successfully
   pass inspection. This type of problem can be seen even with brand new
   equipment.

[[89]edit] Failure to respond

   Some ELCBs do not respond to rectified fault current. This issue is the
   same in principle with ELCBs and RCDs, but ELCBs are on average much
   older and specs have improved considerably over the years, so an old
   ELCB is more likely to have some uncommon fault current waveform that
   it will not respond to.

   With any mechanical device, failures occur, and ELCBs should ideally be
   tested periodically to ensure they still work.

   If either of the earth wires become disconnected from the ELCB, it will
   no longer trip and the installation will often no longer be properly
   earthed.
