   MC and BC series supercapacitors (up to 3000 [9]farad capacitance)
   produced by [10]Maxwell Technologies

   Electric double-layer capacitors, also known as supercapacitors,
   [11]electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) or ultracapacitors
   are electrochemical [12]capacitors that have an unusually high
   [13]energy density when compared to common capacitors, typically on the
   order of thousands of times greater than a high-capacity
   [14]electrolytic capacitor. For instance, a typical [15]D-cell sized
   electrolytic capacitor will have a capacitance in the range of tens of
   millifarads. The same size electric double-layer capacitor would have a
   capacitance of several [16]farads, an improvement of about two or three
   [17]orders of magnitude in capacitance, but usually at a lower working
   voltage. Larger, commercial electric double-layer capacitors have
   capacities as high as 5,000 farads.^[18][1] The highest energy density
   in production is 30 Wh/kg.^[19][2]

   Supercapacitors aim to fill the gap between capacitors and batteries
   ^[20][3].

   Electric double-layer capacitors have a variety of commercial
   applications, notably in "energy smoothing" and momentary-load devices.
   Some of the earliest uses were motor startup capacitors for large
   engines in [21]tanks and [22]submarines, and as the cost has fallen
   they have started to appear on diesel trucks and railroad
   locomotives.^[23][4] More recently they have become a topic of some
   interest in the [24]green energy world, where their ability to soak up
   energy quickly makes them particularly suitable for [25]regenerative
   braking applications, whereas batteries have difficulty in this
   application due to slow charging rates. New technology in development
   at [26]LEES could potentially make EDLCs with high enough energy
   density to be an attractive replacement for batteries in
   [27]all-electric cars and [28]plug-in hybrids, as EDLCs are quick
   charging and exhibit temperature stability^[[29]citation needed]. They
   can also be used in [30]PCMCIA+ cards, [31]flash light devices in
   digital cameras, [32]portable media players and automated meter reading
   ^[33][5].

   Another type of high-energy-density capacitor, not an EDLC, has been
   proposed by the company [34]EEStor.

[[43]edit] Concept

   Comparison of construction diagrams of three capacitors. Left: "normal"
   [44]capacitor, middle: [45]electrolytic, right: electric double-layer
   capacitor

   In a conventional capacitor, energy is stored by the removal of charge
   carriers, typically [46]electrons, from one metal plate and depositing
   them on another. This charge separation creates a potential between the
   two plates, which can be harnessed in an external circuit. The total
   energy stored in this fashion is proportional to both the number of
   charges stored and the potential between the plates. The former is
   essentially a function of size and the material properties of the
   plates, while the latter is limited by the [47]dielectric breakdown
   between the plates. Different materials sandwiched between the plates
   to separate them result in different voltages to be stored. Optimizing
   the material leads to higher energy densities for any given size of
   capacitor.

   In contrast with traditional capacitors, electric double-layer
   capacitors do not have a conventional dielectric. Rather than two
   separate plates separated by an intervening substance, these capacitors
   use "plates" that are in fact two layers of the same substrate, and
   their electrical properties, the so-called "electrical double layer",
   result in the effective separation of charge despite the vanishingly
   thin (on the order of nanometers) physical separation of the layers.
   The lack of need for a bulky layer of dielectric permits the packing of
   "plates" with much larger surface area into a given size, resulting in
   their extraordinarily high capacitances in practical sized packages.

   In an electrical double layer, each layer by itself is quite
   conductive, but the physics at the interface where the layers are
   effectively in contact means that no significant current can flow
   between the layers. However, the double layer can withstand only a low
   voltage, which means that electric double-layer capacitors rated for
   higher voltages must be made of matched series-connected individual
   electric double-layer capacitors, much like series-connected cells in
   higher-voltage batteries.

   In general, electric double-layer capacitors improve storage density
   through the use of a nanoporous material, typically [48]activated
   charcoal, in place of the conventional insulating barrier. Activated
   charcoal is a powder made up of extremely small and very "rough"
   particles, which in bulk form a low-density volume of particles with
   holes between them that resembles a [49]sponge. The overall surface
   area of even a thin layer of such a material is many times greater than
   a traditional material like aluminum, allowing many more charge
   carriers (ions or radicals from the electrolyte) to be stored in any
   given volume. The downside is that the charcoal is taking the place of
   the improved insulators used in conventional devices, so in general
   electric double-layer capacitors use low potentials on the order of 2
   to 3 V.

   Activated charcoal is not the "perfect" material for this application.
   The charge carriers are actually (in effect) quite large - especially
   when surrounded by solvent molecules - and are often larger than the
   holes left in the charcoal, which are too small to accept them,
   limiting the storage. Recent research in electric double-layer
   capacitors has generally focused on improved materials that offer even
   higher usable surface areas. Experimental devices developed at MIT
   replace the charcoal with [50]carbon nanotubes, which have similar
   charge storage capability as charcoal (which is almost pure carbon) but
   are mechanically arranged in a much more regular pattern that exposes a
   much greater suitable surface area.^[51][6] Other teams are
   experimenting with custom materials made of activated [52]polypyrrole,
   and even nanotube-impregnated papers.

   various energy-storage devices

   In terms of energy density, existing commercial electric double-layer
   capacitors range around 0.5 to 30 Wh/kg, with the standardized cells
   available from [56]Maxwell Technologies rated at 6 Wh/kg and ACT in
   production of 30 Wh/kg. ^[57][7]^[58][8] Experimental electric
   double-layer capacitors from the MIT LEES project have demonstrated
   densities of 30 Wh/kg and appear to be scalable to 60 Wh/kg in the
   short term,^[59][9] while [60]EEStor claims their examples will offer
   capacities about 400 Wh/kg. For comparison, a conventional
   [61]lead-acid battery is typically 30 to 40 Wh/kg and modern
   [62]lithium-ion batteries are about 160 Wh/kg. In automobile
   applications gasoline has a [63]net calorific value (NCV) of around
   12,000 Wh/kg, which operates at 20% tank-to-wheel efficiency giving an
   effective energy density of 2,400 Wh/kg.

   Additionally, electric double-layer capacitors offer much higher
   [64]power density than batteries. Power density combines the energy
   density with the speed that the energy can be drawn out of the device.
   Batteries, which are based on the movement of charge carriers in a
   liquid electrolyte, have relatively slow charge and discharge times.
   Capacitors, on the other hand, can be charged or discharged at a rate
   that is typically limited by current heating of the electrodes. So
   while existing electric double-layer capacitors have energy densities
   that are perhaps 1/10th that of a conventional battery, their power
   density is generally ten to one-hundred times as great (see diagram,
   right).

[[65]edit] History

   The electric double-layer capacitor effect was first noticed in 1957 by
   [66]General Electric engineers experimenting with devices using porous
   carbon electrode.^[67][10] It was believed that the energy was stored
   in the carbon pores and it exhibited "exceptionally high
   [68]capacitance", although the mechanism was unknown at that time.

   General Electric did not immediately follow up on this work, and the
   modern version of the devices were eventually developed by researchers
   at [69]Standard Oil of Ohio in 1966, after they accidentally
   re-discovered the effect while working on experimental [70]fuel cell
   designs.^[71][11] Their cell design used two layers of [72]activated
   charcoal separated by a thin porous insulator, and this basic
   mechanical design remains the basis of most electric double-layer
   capacitors to this day.

   Standard Oil also failed to commercialize their invention, licensing
   the technology to [73]NEC, who finally marketed the results as
   supercapacitors in 1978, to provide backup power for maintaining
   computer memory.^[74][11] The market expanded slowly for a time, but
   starting around the mid-1990s various advances in [75]materials science
   and simple development of the existing systems led to rapidly improving
   performance and an equally rapid reduction in cost.

   In 2005, the ultracapacitor market was between US $272 million and $400
   million, depending on the source. It is rapidly growing, especially in
   the [76]automotive sector.^[77][11]

   Recently ^[78][12], all solid state micrometer-scale electric
   double-layer capacitors based on [79]advanced superionic conductors had
   been recognized as critical electron component of future sub-voltage
   and [80]deep-sub-voltage nanoelectronics and related technologies (22
   nm technological node of CMOS and beyond).

[[81]edit] Technology advantages

   Due to the capacitor's high number of charge-discharge cycles (millions
   or more compared to 2001000 for most commercially available
   rechargeable batteries) there are no disposable parts during the whole
   operating life of the device, which makes the device environmentally
   friendly. Batteries wear out on the order of a few years, and their
   highly reactive chemical electrolytes present a serious disposal and
   safety hazard. This can be improved by only charging under favorable
   conditions, at an ideal rate, and, for some chemistries, as
   infrequently as possible. Electric double-layer capacitors can help in
   this regard, acting as a charge conditioner, storing energy from other
   sources for load balancing purposes and then using any excess energy to
   charge the batteries only at opportune times.

   Other advantages of electric double-layer capacitors compared with
   rechargeable batteries are extremely low internal resistance or
   [82]ESR, high efficiency (up to 97-98%), high output power, extremely
   low heating levels, and improved safety. According to ITS (Institute of
   Transportation Studies, Davis, CA) test results, the [83]specific power
   of electric double-layer capacitors can exceed 6 [84]kW/[85]kg at 95%
   efficiency ^[86][13]

   The idea of replacing batteries with capacitors in conjunction with
   novel alternative energy sources became a conceptual umbrella of the
   Green Electricity (GEL) Initiative [87][2], [88][3], introduced by Dr.
   Alexander Bell. One particular successful implementation of the GEL
   Initiative concept was a muscle-driven autonomous solution which
   employs a multi-farad electric double-layer capacitor (hecto- and
   kilofarad range capacitors are now available) as an intermediate energy
   storage to power a variety of portable electrical and electronic
   devices such as MP3 players, AM/FM radios, flashlights, cell phones,
   and emergency kits.^[89][14] As the energy density of electric
   double-layer capacitors is bridging the gap with batteries, it is hoped
   that in the near future the automotive industry will start to deploy
   ultracapacitors as a replacement for chemical batteries.

[[90]edit] Transportation applications

   China is experimenting with a new form of [91]electric bus (capabus)
   that runs without powerlines using power stored in large onboard
   electric double-layer capacitors, which are quickly recharged whenever
   the electric bus stops at any bus stop (under so-called electric
   umbrellas), and fully charged in the [92]terminus. A few prototypes
   were being tested in Shanghai in early 2005. In 2006, two commercial
   bus routes began to use electric double-layer capacitor buses; one of
   them is route 11 in [93]Shanghai. ^[94][15]

   In 2001 and 2002, VAG, the public transport operator in [95]Nuremberg,
   Germany tested a hybrid bus which uses a [96]diesel-electric drive
   system with electric double-layer capacitors.^[97][16]

   Since 2003 Mannheim Stadtbahn in Mannheim, Germany has operated an LRV
   (light-rail vehicle) which uses electric double-layer capacitors to
   store braking energy.^[98][17]^[99][18]

   Other companies from the public transport manufacturing sector are
   developing electric double-layer capacitor technology: The
   Transportation Systems division of [100]Siemens AG is developing a
   mobile energy storage based on double-layer capacitors called Sibac
   Energy Storage ^[101][19] and also Sitras SES, a stationary version
   integrated into the trackside power supply ^[102][20]. The company
   Cegelec is also developing a electric double-layer capacitor-based
   energy storage system^[[103]citation needed].

   Proton Power Systems has created the world's first triple hybrid
   Forklift Truck, which uses [104]fuel cells and [105]battery as primary
   energy storage and electric double-layer capacitors to supplement this
   energy storage solution.^[106][21]

[[107]edit] Technology

   [108]Carbon nanotubes and certain [109]conductive polymers, or carbon
   [110]aerogels, are practical for supercapacitors:
     * Carbon nanotubes have excellent nanoporosity properties, allowing
       tiny spaces for the polymer to sit in the tube and act as a
       dielectric. MIT's Laboratory of Electromagnetic and Electronic
       Systems (LEES) is researching using carbon
       [111]nanotubes^[112][22].

     * Some polymers (eg. [113]polyacenes) have a [114]redox
       (reduction-oxidation) storage mechanism along with a high surface
       area.

     * Supercapacitors are also being made of carbon [115]aerogel. This is
       a unique material providing extremely high surface area of about
       400-1000 m/g. The electrodes of aerogel supercapacitors are usually
       made of non-[116]woven paper made from [117]carbon fibers and
       [118]coated with organic aerogel, which then undergoes
       [119]pyrolysis. The paper is a [120]composite material where the
       carbon fibers provide structural integrity and the aerogel provides
       the required large surface. Small aerogel supercapacitors are being
       used as backup electricity storage in microelectronics, but
       applications for [121]electric vehicles are expected. The voltage
       of an aerogel capacitor is limited to a few volts. Higher voltages
       will lead to ionization of the carbon, which will damage the
       capacitor. Carbon aerogel capacitors have achieved 325 J/g (90
       Wh/Kg) energy density and 20 W/g power density.^[122][23]

     * The company [123]Reticle claims to be able to make supercapacitors
       from [124]activated carbon in solid form. This substance they call
       consolidated amorphous carbon (CAC). It can have a surface area
       exceeding 2800 m^2/g and according to [125]US patent 6787235 may be
       cheaper to produce than aerogel carbon.

     * Systematic pore size control showed by Y-Carbon^[126][24] can be
       used to increase the energy density by more than 100% than what is
       commercially available^[[127]citation needed].

     * The company [128]Tartu Technologies developed supercapacitors from
       mineral based carbon. These nonactivated carbon are synthesised
       from the metal- or metalloid carbides, e.g. SiC, TiC, Al4C3, etc.
       as claimed in [129]US patent 6602742 and [130]WO patent 2005118471
       . The synthesised nanostructured porous carbon, often called
       Carbide Derived Carbon (CDC), have surface area about 400 m/g to
       2000 m/g with specific capacitance up to 100 F/mL (in organic
       electrolyte). They claim a supercapacitor with a volume of 135 mL
       and 200 g weight having 1.6 kF capacitance. The energy density is
       more than 47 kJ/L at 2.85 V and power density of over 20
       W/g.^[131][25]

   In August 2007, a research team at [132]RPI developed a paper
   [133]battery with aligned carbon nanotubes, designed to function as
   both a lithium-ion battery and a supercapacitor (called bacitor), using
   an [134]ionic liquid, essentially a liquid [135]salt, as the
   [136]electrolyte. The sheets can be rolled, twisted, folded, or cut
   into numerous shapes with no loss of integrity or efficiency, or
   stacked, like printer paper (or a [137]Voltaic pile), to boost total
   output. Further, they can be made in a variety of sizes, from
   [138]postage stamp to [139]broadsheet. Their light weight and low cost
   make them attractive for portable electronics, [140]aircraft,
   [141]automobiles, and toys (such as [142]model aircraft), while their
   ability to use electrolytes in blood make them potentially useful for
   medical devices such as [143]pacemakers. In addition, they are
   [144]biodegradable.^[145][26]
