   Dragon Quest ( ,Doragon Kuesuto^[27]?), published as Dragon Warrior in
   North America until the 2005 release of [28]Dragon Quest VIII: Journey
   of the Cursed King, is a series of [29]role-playing games created by
   [30]Yji Horii and published by [31]Square Enix (formerly [32]Enix).
   Installments of the series have appeared on [33]MSX computers,
   [34]Famicom/NES, [35]Super Famicom/Super NES, [36]Game Boy Color,
   [37]Game Boy Advance, [38]Nintendo DS, [39]PlayStation, [40]PlayStation
   2 and [41]Wii [42]video game consoles, as well as on several models of
   [43]mobile phone. As of February 2009, the Dragon Quest series has sold
   nearly 45 million units worldwide.^[44][1]^[45][2] It is Square Enix's
   second most successful franchise and is one of the most popular video
   game franchises in Japan.^[46][3]^[47][4]

   Dragon Quest's North American name was changed due to a trademark
   conflict with the [48]role-playing game [49]DragonQuest, which was
   published by veteran wargame publisher [50]SPI in the 1980s until the
   company's [51]bankruptcy in 1982 and purchase by [52]TSR, which then
   published it as an alternate line to [53]Dungeons & Dragons until
   1987.^[54][5] In 2003, Square Enix registered the Dragon Quest
   [55]trademark in the US, making the Dragon Warrior name obsolete.

[[72]edit] Development

[[73]edit] History

   In 1982, Enix sponsored a national video game programming contest,
   which brought much of the Dragon Quest team together, including Yji
   Horii.^[74][6] The prize of the competition was a trip to the United
   States, and a visit to AppleFest '83 in San Francisco, where Horii
   discovered Wizardry.^[75][7] Koichi Nakamura and Yukinobu Chida, two
   other winners of the contest, along with Horii, released [76]The
   Portopia Serial Murder Case for the Famicom for Enix. Sugiyama, already
   famous for jingles and pop songs, impressed with the group's work, sent
   a postcard to Enix, commenting on the software.^[77][8] In response,
   Enix asked him to write music for some of its games. The group then
   decided to make a [78]console role-playing game, using a combination of
   Wizardry and Ultima. [79]Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, who knew
   Horii through the manga magazine [80]Shonen Jump, was commissioned to
   illustrate the characters and monsters to separate the game from other
   RPGs of the time and the Dragon Quest "team" was born.^[81][9]^[82][10]

   Dragon Quest was created by [83]Yji Horii, who has been the scenario
   director since. The series monster and character designs, as well as
   box art, are done by famed [84]Dragon Ball [85]manga artist, [86]Akira
   Toriyama.^[87][11] All of the [88]music for the Dragon Quest series has
   been composed by [89]Koichi Sugiyama.^[90][6] Dragon Quest games have
   been developed by [91]Chunsoft, [92]Heartbeat, [93]Artepiazza, and
   starting with Dragon Quest VIII, [94]Level-5.^[95][12] Horii's own
   company, [96]Armor Project, is in charge of the Dragon Quest games,
   which were published by Enix and now Square Enix. While Toriyama is the
   series' character designer, the primary designs are first conceived by
   Horii, before being handed to Toriyama to re-draw under Horii's
   supervision.^[97][13] When Horii first created Dragon Quest, most
   people doubted that a fantasy series with swords and dungeons instead
   of science fiction would become popular in Japan; but the series has
   become a phenomenon there.^[98][14]

   Dragon Quest is not nearly as successful outside Japan, having been
   eclipsed by [99]Final Fantasy and other RPG series. Because of
   [100]Enix America Corporation's closure in the mid 1990's, [101]Dragon
   Quest V and [102]Dragon Quest VI were never officially released in
   North America. In Europe, none of the games have seen release prior to
   the spin-off [103]Dragon Warrior Monsters then [104]Dragon Quest VIII:
   Journey of the Cursed King. With the merger of Square with Enix in
   2003, the number of places that Dragon Quest games are released has
   greatly increased.^[105][14] In May 2008, Square Enix announced
   localizations of the Nintendo DS remakes of Dragon Quest IV, V, and VI,
   known collectively as the Zenithia trilogy, for North America and the
   PAL region.^[106][15]^[107][16] With this announcement, all the main
   games in the Dragon Quest series will now have seen release outside
   Japan at least once.

   The ninth installment is due to be released in Japan for Nintendo DS in
   July 2009. North American and European and other PAL region releases
   are suspected to follow. The tenth installment of the main series is
   currently in development for the Wii.

[[108]edit] Creation and design

     At the time I first made Dragon Quest, role-playing games on the
     computer were still very much in the realm of hardcore fans and not
     very accessible to other players. So I decided to create a system
     that was easy to understand and emotionally involving, and then
     placed my story within that framework.

     [109]Yji Horii^[110][9]

   [111]Yji Horii originally used the full-screen map of Ultima and the
   battle and stats oriented Wizardry screen to create the gameplay of
   Dragon Quest.^[112][7] The first six Dragon Quest games' stories are
   divided into two [113]trilogies. The first three games of the series
   tell the story of the legendary hero known as [114]Roto (also known as
   Erdrick or Loto in the American NES and GBC versions, respectively).
   Dragon Quest IV-VI are based around a castle in the sky called
   [115]Zenithia, and are referred to as the Tenku in Japan, meaning
   [116]Heaven. The main series from [117]Dragon Quest VII on are
   independent of each other and stand alone.^[118][17]

   The typical Dragon Quest plot involves a certain villain to be defeated
   at the end of the game, usually one who threatens the world in some
   way. However, the plotline often consists of smaller stories involving
   different NPC's the player meets as the adventure goes on.^[119][18]
   The games themselves feature a number of religious overtones--saving
   the game (in later games) and reviving characters who have died is
   performed by clergy in churches. [120]Bishops are often seen wandering
   around the overworld of [121]Dragon Warrior Monsters and have the
   ability to heal. The final enemy in some of the Dragon Quest games is
   known as the Demon Lord. For instance, in [122]Dragon Warrior VII, the
   Demon Lord, known as Orgodemir in that particular game, is the final
   [123]boss, and there is also a [124]sidequest to battle God
   himself.^[125][10] The first four Dragon Warrior titles suffered from
   substantial [126]censorship in their North American localizations,
   largely in keeping with [127]Nintendo of America's content guidelines
   at the time, which placed severe restrictions on religious iconography
   and mature content. When these games were remade for the [128]Game Boy
   Color, many of these censorships were taken out.^[129][19] Since Dragon
   Warrior VII, the games have been kept similar to their original
   versions when going through localization.^[130][20]

[[154]edit] Spin-offs

   The franchise also includes several spin-off series, including
   [155]Dragon Quest Monsters and [156]Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest, as
   well as arcade games like the Japanese game [157]Dragon Quest: Monster
   Battle Road.^[158][22] Several games in both the [159]Mystery Dungeon
   and [160]Itadaki Street series have characters from the Dragon Quest
   games.
   The Torneko games use a roguelike battle system.

   In 1993, [161]Chunsoft created a [162]Super Famicom game for Torneko,
   romanized Torneco ( ^[163]?)^[164][23] in Japan and originally known as
   simply Taloon to American gamers, a [165]fictional character first
   appearing in [166]Dragon Warrior IV.^[167][24] The game, titled
   [168]Torneco no Daibken: Fushigi no Dungeon which loosely translates to
   Torneco's Great Adventure: Mysterious Dungeon, was a [169]roguelike
   which continued Torneko's story from [170]Dragon Quest IV, where he
   wished to make his store grow even further by venturing into mysterious
   dungeons and getting more items for stock. It was very successful, both
   on namesake and quality. A direct sequel to Torneco no Daibouken came
   out in Japan and the United States in 2000 called [171]Torneko: The
   Last Hope (Torneco no Daibouken 2 in Japan). This game was very similar
   to the first, but it is considered much easier by comparison.^[172][25]
   It was received well enough in Japan to warrant a third direct sequel,
   on the [173]PlayStation 2, titled Torneco no Daibouken: Fushigi no
   Dungeon 3. Both the second and third Torneko games have been ported to
   the [174]Game Boy Advance. Following the success of Torneko, many other
   [175]Fushigi no Dungeon games were published by various companies (most
   of which developed by Chunsoft), among the best known are [176]Chocobo
   no Fushigina Dungeon and Nightmare of Druaga: Mysterious Dungeon.

   Two spin-offs are played by physically swinging a controller using it
   as a sword to slash enemies among other things. [177]Kenshin Dragon
   Quest is a stand alone game which comes with the a toy sword as the
   controller, and a toy shield containing the game's hardware.^[178][26]
   [179]Dragon Quest Swords is an exclusive [180]Wii title which uses the
   motion sensing abilities of the [181]Wii Remote similarly. Finally, a
   card-based [182]arcade game, known as [183]Dragon Quest: Monster Battle
   Road and developed by [184]Level-5, was released exclusively in
   Japan.^[185][27]

[[215]edit] Common elements

[[216]edit] Gameplay

   Typical battle from [217]Dragon Warrior III

   The game player's party walks into a town and buys weapons, armor, and
   items in order to defeat monsters easily. When the player's party is
   out of the town, the party is vulnerable to random monster attacks.
   When players encounter monsters, they have several options from which
   to choose through menus. The player can attack and defeat the enemy
   with weapons, magic, or items. The player can also attempt to run away
   from the fight. However, this option is not available during a
   [218]boss battle. After a player wins a battle by defeating all the
   monsters, the player's party members gain [219]experience points (EXP)
   in order to gain new levels. When a certain character gains a new
   level, the stats of the character are upgraded.^[220][28]

   To save one's progress, the player must visit a Church (also known as a
   House of Healing in early North American versions) and talk to a priest
   or nun. In early versions of Dragon Quest, the player must visit a king
   in order to save his or her progress^[221][28] (this does not include
   the first two Dragon Quest titles for the Famicom, which use a password
   system).^[222][29] If the player's party dies in battle, the group will
   lose half of their gold and the leader of the party warps back to the
   nearest church. The leader then needs to pay a priest to revive his/her
   party members. More recent games in the series have banks in many towns
   that allow the player to store gold, which prevents it from being lost
   when the party dies.

   [223]Dragon Warrior III, [224]Dragon Quest VI, and [225]Dragon Warrior
   VII feature several classes to choose for the party members.^[226][10]
   Each of these installments possesses its own particular set of classes,
   typical classes include the [227]Cleric / Priest / Pilgrim,
   [228]Fighter, Hero, Jester / Goof-Off, Thief, [229]Warrior / Soldier
   and [230]Wizard / Mage^[231][30]^[232][31]. Dragon Quest VI includes
   two monster classes^[233][32], and Dragon Warrior VII includes
   dozens^[234][33].

[[235]edit] Monsters

   Rocket, a common [236]slime monster starring in [237]Dragon Quest
   Heroes.

   The series features several recurring monsters, such as Slimes,
   Drackies, Shadows, Mummies, Trick Bags, and
   Dragons.^[238][34]^[239][35]^[240][36] Many of the monsters have been
   designed by Akira Toriyama. Many of the Dragon Quest monsters have been
   featured in the [241]Dragon Quest Monsters series of games, which
   allows the player to catch monsters and use them in battle. This idea
   is also used in Dragon Quest V, although humans fight in battle as
   well.

   The official [242]mascot of the Dragon Quest series is the [243]Slime.
   A Slime is a small blob with a face, shaped like water droplet. It has
   appeared in every Dragon Quest game and it is usually one of the first
   monsters the player encounters.^[244][37] The Slime's popularity has
   netted it two [245]spin-offs: [246]Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest and
   [247]Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime. They also make a significant
   showing in the Japanese manga and two-episode anime [248]Dragon Half.

[[249]edit] Loto/Erdrick

   Erdrick, also known as Roto in Japan or Loto in the North American
   localization of the Game Boy Color remakes of the first three games, is
   a legendary hero from the Dragon Quest series. The first three Dragon
   Quest games make up the "Erdrick [250]trilogy," which are all connected
   to the legend of Erdrick. He is known in the game as the hero who freed
   Alefgard from darkness.^[251][38] The name Erdrick was first mentioned
   in the English [252]localization, [253]Dragon Warrior in which the
   player is referred to as Erdrick's descendent.^[254][39] Erdricks
   [255]legend was completed with the 1991 release of [256]Dragon Warrior
   III.

   In [257]Dragon Warrior, Erdrick was the ancestor of the Hero. The Hero
   follows in the footsteps of Erdrick to ultimately reach the
   Dragonlord's Castle and confront the [258]Dragonlord. In [259]Dragon
   Warrior II, the heroes are descendants of Erdrick, and also of the Hero
   from Dragon Warrior.^[260][40]^[261][41] They explore the expanded
   world of Torland, including Alefgard as seen in the first game. At the
   end of Dragon Warrior III, the King of Alefgard bestows upon the Hero
   the Order of Erdrick, the countrys highest honor reserved only for true
   heroes. While this implies Erdrick is merely a title, it isn't possible
   to name the Hero Erdrick at the beginning of Dragon Warrior III. In
   [262]Dragon Warrior III, the origins of the hero Erdrick are revealed;
   therefore, the [263]chronological order of the first three games is
   Dragon Warrior III, Dragon Warrior I, and then Dragon Warrior
   II.^[264][42] This chronology is further evidenced in the naming of the
   hero's weapon, armor and shield. After the events of Dragon Warrior
   III, the hero's armaments are renamed as the Erdrick (or Loto) Sword
   and Armor in Dragon Warrior I and Dragon Warrior II.

   The Hero, originally known as Erdrick to many English-speaking players,
   is also known by two other names. In the original [265]Japanese
   language games (Dragon Quest), Erdrick is known exclusively by the name
   Roto, which is also used by some [266]import [267]gamers. Another
   [268]romanization of the name is Loto, which was used in place of
   Erdrick when [269]Enix America, Inc. re-released Dragon Warrior I,
   Dragon Warrior II, and Dragon Warrior III on the [270]Game Boy Color.
   This was most likely used because the Japanese character () is not
   strictly an R or an L sound, but lies somewhere in between. Therefore
   it is properly [271]transliterated either way.

   In the original [272]Final Fantasy, Square parodies Dragon Warrior by
   displaying a grave for Erdrick in the town of Elfland.^[273][43] In
   retaliation, Enix hid a Cid grave in Dragon Quest III. A parody of
   Erdrick's sword is wielded by [274]Gilgamesh in [275]Final Fantasy XII:
   it is referred to as the "Wyrmhero Blade" (In the Japanese version, it
   is called "Tolo Sword").

[[276]edit] Zenithia

   Zenithia, also called Zenith Castle or simply Zenith, is the name of a
   fictional sky castle from the series. The first appearance is in
   [277]Dragon Warrior IV, and the castle is one of several elements from
   [278]Dragon Quest IV, [279]V, and [280]VI which suggest the three games
   are linked as a [281]trilogy; this group is often called the Tenk
   (Japanese for Heaven), or the Tenk no Shiro (Castle in the Sky)
   trilogy.^[282][44]^[283][45] Yji Horii explained that the trilogy was
   never intended: "Each Dragon Quest title represents a fresh start and a
   new story, so I don't see too much of a connection between the games in
   the series. I guess it could be said that the imagination of players
   has brought the titles together in a certain fashion."^[284][46]

   In Dragon Warrior IV, Zenithia can be accessed by climbing the Tower
   near Gottside (Azimuth in the DQ4DS release), which goes as far up to
   the sky. It is directly above the entrance to the world of darkness. In
   Dragon Quest V, Zenithia has fallen into a lake south of Elheaven. This
   happened when the Golden Orb, half of a set of magical orbs that
   supported the castle in the sky, fell from its place. Once recovered
   and returned to Master Dragon, Zenithia will rise again. This time, the
   castle can move freely around the sky. In Dragon Quest VI, Zenith
   Castle is sealed away by Demon Lord Durran, and a giant hole is left
   behind in its place in the Dream World. After the Dream World returns
   to its natural state, Zenith Castle is the only part of it that can
   still be seen floating above the real world. A castle in the
   [285]Dragon Warrior III remakes for [286]Super Famicom/[287]Game Boy
   Color is also called Zenith, though the layout differs from the castle
   from the Tenku series.^[288][47]

   Square Enix has released the Celestial Sword (the Zenithian Sword) and
   Sword of Ramias as part of their Dragon Quest Legend Items series -
   miniature collectible toy replicas of artifacts from the Dragon Quest
   universe.

[[289]edit] Music

   Cover of Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Complete CD-Box

   Several albums of Dragon Quest music has been released since the
   original game was made, the first coming out in 1986, based on
   [290]Dragon Quest's music.^[291][48] Each of the Dragon Quest
   soundtracks have been composed and arranged by [292]Koichi Sugiyama,
   who has also composed the music for the games. Since then, an album
   with the game's title and "Symphonic Suite" has been released for each
   game in the main series. Aside from the main series of soundtracks,
   other compilations of Dragon Quest music have been made, such as Dragon
   Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1.^[293][49] Many of the
   soundtracks songs are performed by the [294]London Philharmonic, such
   as Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Complete CD-Box.^[295][50] With a few
   of the soundtracks, a second disc with the original game music is
   included, like with the original Dragon Quest VI soundtrack.^[296][51]

   In 2003, SME Visual Works released Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest
   Complete CD-Box, a box set featuring music from the first seven Dragon
   Quest games.^[297][50] Each of the seven discs is broken up by where
   the music is played in the games. Disc one, for example, has the
   opening overture song from each of the Dragon Quest games, whereas disc
   six features all the battle songs.

   Dragon Quest is such a [298]cultural phenomenon in Japan that there are
   live-action [299]ballets (being the first video game to inspire a
   ballet),^[300][52]^[301][53] [302]musical concerts, and [303]audio CDs
   based on the Dragon Quest universe.^[304][8] It was the first video
   game series to have its music performed live by an orchestra.^[305][54]
   Since 1987, music from Dragon Quest has been performed annually in
   Japan in concert halls.^[306][55]

     * In 1989, a manga was published by Enix called Dragon Quest Monster
       Story.^[321][56] This book featured short stories about various
       Dragon Quest monsters and came with a poster that featured the
       "families" of monsters.

   Additionally, Dragon Quest e no Michi ("The Road to Dragon Quest") is a
   manga book based on the creators of Dragon Quest published by
   Enix.^[322][7] The one volume manga was produced by Ishimori
   Productions, a company famous for creating manga based on famous people
   and businesses. Released in 1990, the manga stars Yujii Hori,
   [323]Koichi Nakamura (main programmer), Koichi Sugiyama, Akira
   Toriyama, and Yukinobu Chida (producer) and involves the creation of
   the series.^[324][7]

[[325]edit] Reception

   Dragon Quest is one of the most popular video game series in
   Japan.^[326][3]^[327][4]^[328][57] All of the games in the main series
   as well as many spin-off games have sold over a million copies, some
   even selling over four million, and sell very quickly.^[329][58] For
   instance, the remake of Dragon Quest V sold 1.3 million copies in Japan
   in its first two days, which is a very high number for a
   remake.^[330][59] In 2006, Japanese gaming magazine [331]Famitsu
   readers voted on the hundred best video games of all time. Dragon Quest
   III came in third, Dragon Quest VIII came in fourth, Dragon Quest VII
   came in ninth, Dragon Quest V came in eleventh, Dragon Quest IV came in
   fourteenth, Dragon Quest II came in seventeenth, Dragon Quest came in
   thirtieth, and Dragon Quest VI came in thirty-fourth.^[332][60]

   The original Dragon Quest game is often claimed to be the birth of the
   [333]console role-playing game, despite the fact that it borrows
   heavily from the [334]The Black Onyx, [335]Ultima, and [336]Wizardry
   series and many others consider Final Fantasy "more
   important."^[337][5] Dragon Warrior was listed on [338]GameSpot's list
   of the 15 most influential games of all time, calling it the "most
   influential role-playing game of all time" and stated that nearly all
   RPGs today have roots in its gameplay.^[339][61] The Dragon Quest
   series was recognized by [340]Guinness World Records with six world
   records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. These
   records include, "Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicon",
   "Fastest Selling Game in Japan", and "First Video Game Series to
   Inspire a Ballet".^[341][62]

   Although the series is a phenomenon in Japan, the games never garnered
   as much attention in North America.^[342][5] Although the first four
   games to come to America generally received good reviews, it was not
   until Dragon Warrior VII was released did Dragon Quest become
   critically acclaimed there.^[343][5] One of the main aspects of the
   series that critics point out, either positively or negatively, is that
   the series "never strays from its classic roots".^[344][57] Unlike
   other modern, complex RPGs, Dragon Quest retains the simple gameplay
   from the first game, which many critics find refreshing and
   nostalgic.^[345][57]^[346][63]^[347][64] Other critics feel differently
   about the series, however, and claim that the story, characters, and
   gameplay have become boring and redundant over the
   years.^[348][65]^[349][66]
