Female education

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Education for girls)
   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search

   Female education is a catch-all term for a complex of issues and
   debates surrounding education ([9]primary education, [10]secondary
   education, [11]tertiary education and [12]health education in
   particular) for females. It includes areas of [13]gender equality and
   access to education, and its connection to the alleviation of
   [14]poverty. Also involved are the issues of [15]single-sex education
   and [16]religious education, in that the division of education along
   [17]gender lines, and religious teachings on education, have been
   traditionally dominant, and are still highly relevant in contemporary
   discussion of female education as a global consideration.

   While the [18]feminist movement has certainly promoted the importance
   of the issues attached to female education, discussion is wide-ranging
   and by no means confined to narrow terms of reference: it includes for
   example [19]AIDS.^[20][1]

[[36]edit] Islamic history

          See also: [37]Madrasah: Female education

   [38]Women in Islam played an important role in the foundations of many
   [39]Islamic educational institutions, such as [40]Fatima al-Fihri's
   founding of the [41]University of Al Karaouine in 859. This continued
   through to the [42]Ayyubid dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries, when
   160 [43]mosques and [44]madrasahs were established in [45]Damascus, 26
   of which were funded by women through the [46]Waqf ([47]charitable
   trust or [48]trust law) system. Half of all the royal [49]patrons for
   these institutions were also women.^[50][2]

   According to the [51]Sunni scholar [52]Ibn Asakir in the 12th century,
   there were opportunities for female education in the [53]medieval
   Islamic world, writing that women could study, earn [54]ijazahs
   ([55]academic degrees), and qualify as [56]scholars and teachers. This
   was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted
   to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and
   daughters.^[57][3] Ibn Asakir had himself studied under 80 different
   female teachers in his time. Female education in the Islamic world was
   inspired by [58]Muhammad's wives: [59]Khadijah, a successful
   businesswoman, and [60]Aisha, a renowned [61]hadith scholar and
   [62]military leader. According to a [63]hadith attributed to
   [64]Muhammad, he praised the women of [65]Medina because of their
   desire for religious knowledge:^[66][4]

   "How splendid were the women of the [67]ansar; shame did not prevent
   them from becoming learned in the faith."

   While it was not common for women to enroll as students in formal
   [68]classes, it was common for women to attend informal [69]lectures
   and study sessions at mosques, madrasahs and other public places. While
   there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men did not
   approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336) who
   was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally [70]audited
   lectures in his time:^[71][5]

[[72]edit] European history

[[73]edit] Medieval period

   In [74]medieval Europe, education for girls and women was at best
   patchy, and was controversial in the light of pronouncements of some
   religious authorities.^[75][6] [76]Shulamith Shahar writes^[77][7], of
   the situation in the nobility, that Among girls there was an almost
   direct transition from childhood to marriage, with all it entails.

   Education was also seen as stratified in the way that society itself
   was: in authors such as [78]Vincent of Beauvais, the emphasis is on
   educating the daughters of the nobility for their social position to
   come.

[[79]edit] Early modern period, humanist attitudes

   In [80]early modern Europe, the question of female education had become
   a standard commonplace one, in other words a [81]literary topos for
   discussion. Around 1405 [82]Leonardo Bruni wrote De studies et
   letteris^[83][8], addressed to Baptista di Montefeltro, the daughter of
   [84]Antonio II da Montefeltro, [85]Duke of Urbino; it commends the
   study of Latin, but warns against arithmetic, geometry, astrology and
   rhetoric. In discussing the classical scholar [86]Isotta Nogarola,
   however, [87]Lisa Jardine^[88][9] notes that (in the middle of the
   fifteenth century), Cultivation is in order for a noblewoman; formal
   competence is positively unbecoming. [89]Christine de Pisan's Livre des
   Trois Vertus is contemporary with Bruni's book, and sets down the
   things which a lady or baroness living on her estates ought to be able
   to do^[90][10].

   [91]Erasmus wrote at length about education in De pueris instituendis
   (1529, written two decades before); not mostly concerned with female
   education^[92][11], in this work he does mention with approbation the
   trouble [93]Thomas More took with teaching his whole family^[94][12].
   In 1523 [95]Juan Luis Vives, a follower of Erasmus, wrote in Latin his
   De institutione foeminae Christianae^[96][13], translated^[97][14] for
   the future Queen [98]Mary of England as Education of a Christian Woman.
   This is in line with traditional [99]didactic literature, taking a
   strongly religious direction^[100][15].

   [101]Elizabeth I of England had a strong humanist education, and was
   praised by her tutor [102]Roger Ascham^[103][16]. She fits the pattern
   of education for leadership, rather than for the generality of women.
   Schooling for girls was rare; the assumption was still that education
   would be brought to the home environment. [104]Comenius was an advocate
   of formal education for women.^[105][17]

[[106]edit] Modern period

   The issue of female education in the large, as emancipatory and
   rational, is broached seriously in [107]the Enlightenment. [108]Mary
   Wollstonecraft is a writer who dealt with it in those terms.

   Actual progress in institutional terms, for secular education of women,
   began in the West in the nineteenth century, with the founding of
   colleges offering single-sex education to young women. These appeared
   in the middle of the century. The Princess: A Medley, a narrative poem
   by [109]Alfred Lord Tennyson, is a satire of women's education, still a
   controversial subject in 1848, when [110]Queen's College first opened
   in London. [111]Emily Davies campaigned for women's education in the
   1860s, and founded [112]Girton College in 1869.

   [113]W. S. Gilbert parodied the poem and treated the themes of women's
   higher education and [114]feminism in general with [115]The Princess in
   (1870) and [116]Princess Ida in 1883. Once women began to graduate from
   institutions of higher education, there steadily developed also a
   stronger academic stream of schooling, and the [117]teacher training of
   women in larger numbers, principally to provide primary education.
   Women's access to traditionally all-male institutions took several
   generations to become complete.

[[118]edit] Educational reform

   The interrelated themes of barriers to education and employment
   continued to form the backbone of feminist thought in the nineteenth
   century, as described, for instance by Harriet Martineau in her 1859
   article Female Industry in the Edinburgh Journal. The economy was
   changing but womens lot was not. Martineau, however, remained a
   moderate, for practical reasons, and unlike Cobbe, did not support the
   emerging call for the vote.

   Slowly the efforts of women like Davies and the Langham group started
   to make inroads. [119]Queens College (1848) and [120]Bedford College
   (1849) in London were starting to offer some education to women from
   1848, and by 1862 Davies was establishing a committee to persuade the
   universities to allow women to sit for the recently established (1858)
   Local Examinations, with partial success (1865). A year later she
   published The Higher Education of Women. She and Leigh Smith founded
   the first higher educational institution for women, with 5 students,
   which became [121]Girton College, Cambridge in 1873, followed by
   [122]Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford in 1879. Bedford had started awarding
   degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few could
   take advantage of them and life for women students was very difficult.

   As part of the continuing dialogue between British and American
   feminists, [123]Elizabeth Blackwell, one of the first women in the US
   to graduate in medicine (1849), lectured in Britain with Langham
   support. They also supported [124]Elizabeth Garretts attempts to assail
   the walls of British medical education against virulent opposition,
   eventually taking her degree in France. Garretts very successful
   campaign to run for office on the London School Board in 1870 is
   another example of a how a small band of very determined women were
   starting to reach positions of influence at the level of local
   government and public bodies.

[[125]edit] Indian history

   In 1878, the [126]University of Calcutta became one of the first
   [127]universities to admit female [128]graduates to its [129]academic
   degree programmes, before any of the [130]British universities had
   later done the same. This point was raised during the [131]Ilbert Bill
   controversy in 1883, when it was being considered whether [132]Indian
   judges should be given the right to judge British offenders. The role
   of women featured prominently in the controversy, where [133]English
   women who opposed the bill argued that [134]Bengali women, who they
   [135]stereotyped as "ignorant", are neglected by their men, and that
   Indian men should therefore not be given the right to judge cases
   involving English women. Bengali women who supported the bill responded
   by claiming that they were more educated than the English women opposed
   to the bill, and pointed out that more [136]Indian women had degrees
   than British women did at the time.^[137][18]

[[138]edit] The Catholic tradition

   In the [139]Roman Catholic tradition, concern for female education has
   expressed itself in the foundation of [140]religious orders, with
   ministries addressing the area. These include the [141]Ursulines (1535)
   and the [142]Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (1849)^[143][19]. A
   convent education is an education for girls by nuns, within a
   [144]convent building. This idea arose in France in the seventeenth
   century, and spread world-wide. Contemporary convent schools are not
   restricted to Catholic pupils. Students in contemporary convent
   education may be boys (particularly in India).

[[145]edit] Today

   In the developed world, women have surpassed men at many levels of
   education. For example, in the [146]United States in 2005/2006, women
   earned 62% of Associate's degrees, 58% of Bachelor's degrees, 60% of
   Master's degrees, and 50% of Doctorates.^[147][20]
