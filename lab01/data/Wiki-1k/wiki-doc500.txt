Dunbar's number

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

          See also: [8]Dunbar (disambiguation)

   Dunbar's number is a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of
   people with whom one can maintain stable [9]social relationships. These
   are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and
   how each person relates to every other person.^[10][1] Proponents
   assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restricted
   rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive
   [11]group. No precise value has been proposed for Dunbar's number, but
   a commonly cited approximation is 150.

   Dunbar's number was first proposed by [12]British anthropologist
   [13]Robin Dunbar, who theorized that "this limit is a direct function
   of relative [14]neocortex size, and that this in turn limits group size
   ... the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on
   the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal
   relationship can be maintained." On the periphery, the number also
   includes past colleagues such as high school friends with whom a person
   would want to reacquaint themselves if they met again.^[15][2]

[[22]edit] Research background

   [23]Primatologists have noted that, due to their highly social nature,
   non-human [24]primates have to maintain personal contact with the other
   members of their social group, usually through [25]grooming. Such
   social groups function as protective cliques within the physical groups
   in which the primates live. The number of social group members a
   primate can track appears to be limited by the volume of the neocortex
   region of their brain. This suggests that there is a species-specific
   index of the social group size, computable from the species' mean
   neocortex volume.

   In a 1992 article, Dunbar used the correlation observed for non-human
   primates to predict a social group size for [26]humans. Using a
   regression equation on data for 38 primate genera, Dunbar predicted a
   human "mean group size" of 148 (casually rounded to 150), a result he
   considered exploratory due to the large error measure (a 95% confidence
   interval of 100 to 230).

   Dunbar then compared this prediction with observable group sizes for
   humans. Beginning with the assumption that the current mean size of the
   human neocortex had developed about 250,000 years [27]BCE, i.e. during
   the [28]Pleistocene, Dunbar searched the [29]anthropological and
   [30]ethnographical literature for census-like group size information
   for various [31]hunter-gatherer societies, the closest existing
   approximations to how anthropology reconstructs the Pleistocene
   societies. Dunbar noted that the groups fell into three categories
   small, medium and large, equivalent to [32]bands, cultural lineage
   groups and [33]tribes with respective size ranges of 30-50, 100-200 and
   500-2500 members each.

   Dunbar's surveys of [34]village and tribe sizes also appeared to
   approximate this predicted value, including 150 as the estimated size
   of a [35]neolithic farming village; 150 as the splitting point of
   [36]Hutterite settlements; 200 as the upper bound on the number of
   academics in a discipline's sub-specialization; 150 as the basic unit
   size of professional [37]armies in [38]Roman antiquity and in
   [39]modern times since the 16th century; and notions of appropriate
   company size.

   Dunbar has argued that 150 would be the mean group size only for
   communities with a very high incentive to remain together. For a group
   of this size to remain cohesive, Dunbar speculated that as much as 42%
   of the group's time would have to be devoted to social grooming.
   Correspondingly, only groups under intense survival
   pressure^[[40]citation needed], such as [41]subsistence villages,
   [42]nomadic tribes, and historical [43]military groupings, have, on
   average, achieved the 150-member mark. Moreover, Dunbar noted that such
   groups are almost always physically close: "... we might expect the
   upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal.
   In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus
   be less familiar with each, so group sizes should be smaller in
   consequence." Thus, the 150-member group would occur only because of
   absolute necessity i.e., due to intense environmental and economic
   pressures.

   Dunbar, author of Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language,
   proposes furthermore that [44]language may have arisen as a "cheap"
   means of social grooming, allowing early humans to efficiently maintain
   social cohesion. Without language, Dunbar speculates, humans would have
   to expend nearly half their time on social grooming, which would have
   made productive, cooperative effort nearly impossible. Language may
   have allowed societies to remain cohesive, while reducing the need for
   physical and social intimacy.^[45][3]

   Dunbar's number has since become of interest in anthropology,
   [46]evolutionary psychology,^[47][4] [48]statistics, and [49]business
   management. Developers of social software are interested in it, as they
   need to know the size of social networks their software needs to take
   into account.

[[50]edit] Alternative numbers

   Dunbar's number is not derived from systematic observation of the
   number of relationships that people living in the contemporary world
   have. As noted above, it comes from extrapolation from nonhuman
   primates and from inspection of selected documents showing [51]network
   sizes in selected pre-industrial villages and settlements in less
   developed countries.

   Anthropologist H. Russell Bernard and Peter Killworth and associates
   have done a variety of field studies in the United States that came up
   with an estimated mean number of ties - 290 - that is roughly double
   Dunbar's estimate. The Bernard-Killworth [52]median of 231 is lower,
   due to upward straggle in the distribution: this is still appreciably
   larger than Dunbar's estimate. The Bernard-Killworth estimate of the
   maximum likelihood of the size of a person's [53]social network is
   based on a number of field studies using different methods in various
   populations. It is not an average of study averages but a repeated
   finding.^[54][5]^[55][6] Nevertheless, the Bernard-Killworth number has
   not been popularized as widely as Dunbar's.

[[56]edit] Popularization

     * Dunbar's number has been most popularized by [57]Malcolm Gladwell's
       [58]The Tipping Point, where it plays a central role in Gladwell's
       arguments about the dynamics of social groups.
     * In a 1985 paper titled [59]"Psychology, Ideology, Utopia, & the
       Commons," psychologist Dennis Fox proposed the same concept as it
       is applied to [60]anarchy, [61]politics, and the [62]tragedy of the
       commons.
     * [63]Neo-Tribalists have also used it to support their critiques of
       modern society.^[[64]citation needed]
     * Recently, the number has been used in the study of [65]Internet
       communities, especially [66]MMORPGs such as [67]Ultima Online, and
       [68]social networking [69]websites such as [70]Facebook and
       [71]MySpace.^[72][7]
     * The [73]Swedish tax authority planned to reorganize its functions
       in 2007. The number 150 was set as the maximum number of people in
       an office, referring to Dunbar's research.^[74][8]
