   skill

   Personal motivation and rewards for effort and achievement that build
   self-esteem

   Progress reports along the way with close interaction and cooperation
   among Sylvan instructors, school teachers and parents

   At Sylvan, we work with parents and teachers to identify the learning
   problem through our Sylvan Skills Assessment. We provide a diagnostic
   and prescriptive approach to learning that includes standardized tests,
   diagnostic tools and personal interviews. This assessment helps Sylvan
   pinpoint exactly where the learning problem exists and allows Sylvan to
   customize a program that fills the skill gaps identified by the
   assessment.

   Sylvan then develops a personalized learning plan that pinpoints the
   skills your child needs. Sylvan provides students with individualized
   attention as well as constant encouragement and praise for a job well
   done. Sylvan provides students with the opportunity to earn tokens as
   part of an effort to reinforce behaviors and attitudes during
   instruction. Many of Sylvan's students look forward to earning their
   tokens and then redeeming them for prizes in the Sylvan Learning
   centers.

   As part of Sylvan's ongoing effort to ensure that students are
   successful and that parents have chosen the right learning program,
   Sylvan carefully monitors each students progress and shares the results
   with their parents throughout the life of the program. In addition,
   Sylvan rpresentatives meet with a students teachers to make sure that
   the success achieved in the center is translated into the classroom.
