[[59]edit] Overview

   Dyscalculia was originally identified in case studies of patients who
   suffered specific arithmetic disabilities as a result of damage to
   specific regions of the brain. Recent research suggests that
   dyscalculia can also occur developmentally, as a genetically-linked
   learning disability which affects a person's ability to understand,
   remember, or manipulate [60]numbers or number facts (e.g., the
   multiplication tables). The term is often used to refer specifically to
   the inability to perform arithmetic operations, but it is also defined
   by some educational professionals and [61]cognitive psychologists as a
   more fundamental inability to conceptualize numbers as abstract
   concepts of comparative quantities (a deficit in "number
   sense").^[62][1] Those who argue for this more constrained definition
   of dyscalculia sometimes prefer to use the technical term Arithmetic
   Difficulties (AD) to refer to calculation and number memory deficits.

   Dyscalculia is a lesser known disability, similar and potentially
   related to [63]dyslexia and [64]developmental dyspraxia. Dyscalculia
   occurs in people across the whole [65]IQ range, and sufferers often,
   but not always, also have difficulties with time, measurement, and
   spatial reasoning.^[[66]citation needed] Current estimates suggest it
   may affect about 5% of the population. Although some researchers
   believe that dyscalculia necessarily implies mathematical reasoning
   difficulties as well as difficulties with arithmetic operations, there
   is evidence (especially from brain damaged patients) that arithmetic
   (e.g. calculation and number fact memory) and mathematical (abstract
   reasoning with numbers) abilities can be dissociated. That is (some
   researchers argue), an individual might suffer arithmetic difficulties
   (or dyscalculia), with no impairment of, or even giftedness in,
   abstract mathematical reasoning abilities.

   The word dyscalculia comes from [67]Greek and [68]Latin which means:
   "counting badly". The prefix "dys" comes from Greek and means "badly".
   "Calculia" comes from the Latin "calculare". which means "to count".
   That word "calculare" again comes from "[69]calculus", which means
   "pebble" or one of the counters on an [70]abacus.

   Dyscalculia can be detected at a young age and measures can be taken to
   ease the problems faced by younger students. The main problem is
   understanding the way mathematics is taught to children. In the way
   that dyslexia can be dealt with by using a slightly different approach
   to teaching, so can dyscalculia. However, dyscalculia is the lesser
   known of these learning disorders and so is often not recognized.

   Another common manifestation of the condition emerges when the
   individual is faced with equation type of problems which contain both
   integers and letters (3A + 4C). It can be difficult for the person to
   differentiate between the integers and the letters. Confusion such as
   reading a '5' for an 'S' or not being able to distinguish between a
   zero '0' for the letter 'O' can keep algebra from being mastered. This
   particular form of dyscalculia is often not diagnosed until middle or
   high school is entered.

   [109]ICD-[110]9  [111]315.1, [112]784.69
     * Frequent difficulties with arithmetic, confusing the signs: [113]+,
       , and .

     * Difficulty with everyday tasks like checking change and reading
       analog clocks.
     * Inability to comprehend financial planning or [114]budgeting,
       sometimes even at a basic level; for example, estimating the cost
       of the items in a shopping basket or balancing a checkbook.
     * Difficulty with multiplication-tables, mental arithmetic, etc.
     * May do fairly well in subjects such as science and geometry, which
       require logic rather than formulae, until a higher level requiring
       calculations is obtained.
     * Difficulty with conceptualizing time and judging the passing of
       time.
     * Particularly problems with differentiating between left and right.
     * Difficulty navigating or mentally "turning" the map to face the
       current direction rather than the common North=Top usage.
     * Having particular difficulty mentally estimating the measurement of
       an object or distance (e.g., whether something is 10 or 20 feet (3
       or 6 meters) away).
     * Often unable to grasp and remember mathematical concepts, rules,
       [115]formulae, and sequences.
     * An inability to read a sequence of numbers, or transposing them
       when repeated, such as turning 56 into 65.
     * Difficulty keeping score during games.
     * Difficulty with games such as poker with more flexible rules for
       scoring.
     * Difficulty in activities requiring [116]sequential processing, from
       the physical (such as dance steps) to the abstract (reading,
       writing and signaling things in the right order). May have trouble
       even with a calculator due to difficulties in the process of
       feeding in variables.
     * The condition may lead in extreme cases to a [117]phobia or durable
       [118]anxiety of mathematics and mathematic-numeric
       devices/coherences.
     * Low [119]latent inhibition, i.e., over-sensitivity to noise, smell,
       light and the inability to tune out, filtering unwanted information
       or impressions. Might have a well-developed sense of imagination
       due to this (possibly as cognitive compensation to
       mathematical-numeric deficits).

[[120]edit] Potential causes

   Scientists have yet to understand the causes of dyscalculia. They have
   been investigating in several domains.
     * Neurological: Dyscalculia has been associated with lesions to the
       [121]supramarginal and [122]angular gyri at the junction between
       the [123]temporal and [124]parietal lobes of the [125]cerebral
       cortex.^[126][2]^[127][3]
     * Deficits in [128]working memory: Adams and Hitch^[129][4] argue
       that working memory is a major factor in mental addition. From this
       base, Geary^[130][5] conducted a study that suggested there was a
       working memory deficit for those who suffered from dyscalculia.
       However, working memory problems are confounded with general
       learning difficulties, thus Geary's findings may not be specific to
       dyscalculia but rather may reflect a greater learning deficit.

   Other causes may be:
     * Short term memory being disturbed or reduced, making it difficult
       to remember calculations.
     * [131]Congenital or [132]hereditary disorders. Studies show
       indications of this, but the evidence is not yet
       concrete.^[[133]citation needed]

[[134]edit] Treatment

   Dyscalculia has no cure per se, but various treatment options have been
   explored. Counselling can help, but not necessarily to a large degree.
   No therapy has been properly verified and proved to be effective. Some
   anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that a certain amount of
   mathematical proficiency can be acquired by alternative systems of
   mathematical calculation such as [135]Eastern mathematics. Anecdotal
   evidence also suggests, in fact, that dyscalculic individuals might
   themselves pursue such systems out of need or interest.
