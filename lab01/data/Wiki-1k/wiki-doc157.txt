   (2005)

   "Don't Phunk with My Heart" is the first [34]single from [35]The Black
   Eyed Peas' fourth album [36]Monkey Business. The song is best known for
   its ambiguous and slightly controversial usage of the word "phunk" in
   its title. Some radio edits replace "phunk" with "mess". The song is
   especially controversial among the Indian movie industry
   ([37]Bollywood) due to the similarity of the melody to standards from
   the 1960s.

   A brief instrumental clip of the song can be heard on various episodes
   of [38]The Hills.

[[46]edit] Song Information

   The song was written by [47]will.i.am, [48]Stacy Ferguson, [49]P.Board,
   [50]G.Pajon Jr, and [51]Full Force, and produced by will.i.am.

   The song also uses a vocal interpolation of "[52]I Wonder If I Take You
   Home" originally performed by [53]Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam. In this
   exotic, but "phunky" jam, will.i.am, Apl.de.ap, and Taboo express their
   romantic interests in how much they enjoy Fergie's company. Fergie,
   however, is not convinced; although she likes them, she is feeling
   insecure, and wonders if she [54]takes them home, if they'll still be
   in love with her. The men try to reassure her that they do love her,
   and that don't just want sex. Fergie is not buying it, and is cautious
   as she warns them, "No-no-no-no, don't phunk with my heart."

   The word "phunk" is used as a euphemism for the word "fuck". The phrase
   "don't fuck with my heart" could be equated with "don't confuse my
   feelings", "don't mess my heart around", don't fuck things up for me";
   all of which could be used to describe the situation described in the
   song. Various radio stations felt that the use of the word "phunk"
   sounded too much like "fuck", thus played an edited version called
   "Don't Mess with My Heart" to keep the same meaning.

   A probable meaning of "phunk" may refer to doing injustice, since
   "funk" and "fuck" has an alternative negative meaning. The word also
   has alternative connotations of evasion or cowardice. The
   interpretation of the song title is hence anyone's guess, but the
   general context can be assumed from the lyrics. One version of "Don't
   Mess with My Heart" also edits out a lyrics that reads, "with your
   pistol shot me, shot me" by changing them to "with your [55]Polaroid
   caught me, caught me". It could also be just a reference to the Phunk
   part of their breakout album [56]Elephunk. The exact meaning of the
   word phunk is "an earthy type of jazz combining it with blues and soul;
   has a heavy bass line that accentuates the first beat in the bar"
   (according to the [57]Word Web [58]Dictionary). The word funk also
   means the same as "phunk" and "draw backw, as with fear or pain due to
   a state of nervous depression. It could also be a euphemism for "fuck"
   as they sound similar.

   The song was nominated for two 2006 [59]Grammys and won for "[60]Best
   Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group".

   This song was copied in Tamil by [61]T.R. Silambarasan in his film
   [62]Saravanan as [63]Gori tera with [64]Jothika in the single.

   The opening music for the song is sampled from "Yeh Mera Dil Payar Ka
   Diwana" in the 1978 Bollywood movie "Don".

   The rest of the song fallows the rhythm of the song "Ae Nujawan Hai
   Sub" from the Bollywood movie "Apradh" from 1972

[[65]edit] Music video

   The video for the song is a parody of game shows, most notably [66]The
   Price Is Right, [67]The Dating Game, and [68]Love
   Connection.^[[69]citation needed] People (who are actually her
   bandmates) are picked to go on a date with Fergie. They spin a wheel to
   find out the situation for the date (which is always disappointing).
   They are transported to the date by a Star Trek-like transporter. At
   the same time, the host (who is actually also will.i.am, but with much
   more hair) always sabotages the date with his voodoo powers (for
   example, Taboo grabs a different girl's ass), and Fergie turns them
   down. The host, Voodoo Thursday, takes his turn at the wheel behind the
   others' backs, and it comes up "Knock Boots". The audience doesn't
   approve. He says something to Fergie, and she makes some expression. He
   lifts her up, and they get transported away.
