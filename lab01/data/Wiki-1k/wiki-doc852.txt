   Memorial for the Cologne victims on Schnstein Str, next to the Bahnhof

   The Edelweiss Pirates (Edelweipiraten) were a loose group of [9]youth
   culture in [10]Nazi Germany. They emerged in western [11]Germany out of
   the [12]German Youth Movement of the late 1930s in response to the
   strict regimentation of the [13]Hitler Youth. Similar in many ways to
   the [14]Leipzig Meuten, they consisted of young people, mainly between
   the ages of 14 and 18, who had either evaded the Hitler Youth by
   leaving school (which was allowed at 14) or avoiding the [15]Reich
   Labour Service and military service.

[[24]edit] Origins

   The origins of the Edelweipiraten can be traced to the period
   immediately prior to [25]World War II, as the state-controlled Hitler
   Youth was mobilized to serve the state, at the expense of the leisure
   activities it had previously offered young people. This tension was
   exacerbated once the war began and youth leaders were conscripted. In
   contrast, the Edelweipiraten offered young people considerable freedom
   to express themselves and to mingle with members of the opposite sex,
   whereas [26]Nazi youth movements were strictly segregated by sex, the
   Hitler-Jugend (boys) and Bund Deutscher Mdel (girls). Though
   predominantly male, the casual meetings of the Edelweipiraten even
   offered German adolescents an opportunity for sexual experimentation
   with the girls that tagged along with every group. The Edelweipiraten
   used many forms and symbols of the organisations of the German Youth
   Movement, which were outlawed earlier. They used their tent (the
   [27]Kohte), their style of clothing (the [28]Jungschaftsjacke), and
   sang songs, all of which were prohibited symbols of the [29]German
   Youth Movement. These symbols and also the traditions such as hiking
   came from members, who were previously in the groups of the German
   Youth Movement.

   The first Edelweipiraten appeared in the late 1930s in western Germany,
   comprising mostly young people between 14 and 18. Individual groups
   were closely associated with different regions but identifiable by a
   common style of dress with their own [30]edelweiss badge and by their
   opposition to what they saw as the paramilitary nature of the Hitler
   Youth.^[31][1] Subgroups of the Edelweipiraten included the Navajos,
   centred on [32]Cologne, the Kittelbach Pirates of [33]Oberhausen and
   [34]Dsseldorf, and the Roving Dudes of [35]Essen.^[36][2] According to
   one Nazi official in 1941, "Every child knows who the Kittelbach
   Pirates are. They are everywhere; there are more of them than there are
   Hitler Youth... They beat up the patrols... They never take no for an
   answer."^[37][3]

   Although they rejected the Nazis' authoritarianism, the
   Edelweipiraten's nonconformist behaviour tended to be restricted to
   petty provocations. Despite this, they represent a group of youth who
   rebelled against the government's regimentation of leisure and were
   unimpressed by the propaganda touting [38]Volksgemeinschaft ("people's
   community").^[39][1]

   During [40]World War II, many Edelweipiraten supported the Allies and
   assisted deserters from the German army. Some groups also collected
   propaganda leaflets dropped by Allied aircraft and pushed them through
   letterboxes.^[41][2]

[[42]edit] Culture

   Apart from gatherings on street corners, the Edelweipiraten engaged in
   hiking and camping trips, defying the restrictions on free movement,
   which kept them away from the prying eyes of the totalitarian
   regime.^[43][2] They were highly antagonistic to the Hitler Youth,
   ambushing their patrols and taking great pride in beating them up. One
   of their slogans was "Eternal War on the Hitler Youth".^[44][2] As one
   subgroup, the Navajos, sang:

                Des Hitlers Zwang, der macht uns klein,

                            (Hitler's compulsion, it makes us small)

                noch liegen wir in Ketten.

                            (still, we're bound in chains)

                Doch einmal werden wir wieder frei,

                            (But one day we'll be free again)

                wir werden die Ketten schon brechen.

                            (We'll smash through the chains)

                Denn unsere Fuste, die sind hart,

                            (For our fists, they are hard)

                ja--und die Messer sitzen los,

                            (Yes, and the knives are attached loosely)

                fr die Freiheit der Jugend,

                            (For the freedom of Youth)

                kmpfen Navajos.

                            (Navajos are struggling)

[[45]edit] Nazi response

   The Nazi response to the Edelweipiraten was typically harsh.
   Individuals identified by the [46]Gestapo as belonging to the various
   gangs were often rounded up and released with their heads shaved to
   shame them. In some cases, young people were sent to [47]concentration
   camps or prison. On [48]October 25, [49]1944, [50]Heinrich Himmler
   ordered a crackdown on the group and in November of that year, a group
   of thirteen people, the heads of the [51]Ehrenfelder Gruppe, were
   publicly hanged in [52]Cologne. Some of these were former
   Edelweipiraten. The Edelweipiraten hanged were six teenagers, amongst
   them [53]Bartholomus Schink, called Barthel, former member of the local
   Navajos. [54]Fritz Theilen survived.

   Nevertheless, government repression never managed to break the spirit
   of most groups, which constituted a [55]subculture that rejected the
   norms of Nazi society. While the Edelweipiraten assisted army deserters
   and others hiding from the Third Reich, they have yet to receive
   recognition as a resistance movement (partly because they were viewed
   with contempt because of their 'proletarian' background and 'criminal'
   activities by many of their former Youth Movement comrades who survived
   the war) and the families of victims killed by the Nazis have as yet
   received no reparations.

[[56]edit] Postwar

   Contrary to what the Allies had hoped, the Edelweipiraten were not
   pro-British or pro-American. In the early days of the Allied
   Occupation, they sought contact with the Occupying Authority to
   intervene in the case of the friends and even to propose that they
   might go on patrol, as did the [57]Wuppertal Edelweipiraten.^[58][4]
   They were taken seriously and courted by various factions; the first
   known pamphlets of the KPD ([59]Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands) in
   July 1945 were directed at them.^[60][5]

   While a small number of Edelweipiraten remained in the Antifascist
   Youth and the [61]Free German Youth organizations, the majority turned
   their back on these bodies as soon as they realized that, in the words
   of one member, "politics were taking centre stage again". For example,
   a group in [62]Bergisch Gladbach disbanded when young people of
   Communist orientation tried to form a majority in the group.^[63][4]

   The Edelweipiraten's turning away from the re-authorized political
   youth groups forced them into the role of social outcasts and brought
   them into conflict with the Allies. The headquarters of the American
   Counter-Intelligence Corps in Frankfurt reported in May 1946 that
   Edelweiss activities were known throughout the British and American
   Zones.

   Groups identifying themselves as Edelweipiraten conducted many violent
   attacks against Soviet Russian and Polish [64]Displaced Persons. Author
   Peter Schult witnessed such an attack against a Polish black
   marketeer.^[65][6] There were also attacks against German women who
   were known to have been friends or been intimate with British
   soldiers.^[66][7]

   In a trial held by a military court at [67]Uelzen in April 1946, a
   juvenile named as Heinz D. was initially sentenced to death, for his
   "...very active part in carrying out the nefarious schemes of the E.
   Piraten. An organization such as this might well threaten the peace of
   Europe." The sentence was commuted the following month to a prison
   term. In the Soviet Zone, young people suspected of being
   Edelweipiraten were sentenced to a virtually obligatory 25 years in
   prison.^[68][8]

   From 1946 onward, Allied Intelligence officials noted "resistance
   activities" by an organization which had appropriated the name of the
   Edelweipiraten; this group was reported to be mainly comprised of
   former members and officers of Hitler Youth units, ex-soldiers and
   drifters, and was described by an intelligence report as "a
   sentimental, adventurous, and romantically anti-social [movement]". It
   was regarded as a serious menace by US officials.^[69][9]

[[70]edit] Cultural references

   Several bands have used the Edelweiss Pirates name, most notably the
   [71]London-based multi-instrumental indie group fronted by [72]Jimmy
   Loew or the [73]Edinburgh-based funk rockers. [74]Cambridge punk band
   The Edelweiss Pirates also adopted the name as a protest against
   fascism on the [75]punk and [76]skinhead scene.

   The roots and background of the Edelweiss Pirates movement were
   broached in the 2004 film [77]Edelweiss Pirates directed by [78]Niko
   von Glasow.
