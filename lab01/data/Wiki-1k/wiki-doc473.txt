Dual carriageway

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [7]navigation, [8]search
   A typical British dual carriageway, this one being the [9]A63(T) near
   [10]Hull.

   A dual carriageway or divided highway is a road or [11]highway in which
   the two directions of traffic are separated by a central barrier or
   strip of land, known as a [12]central reservation or median. This type
   of road is usually able to carry a great deal more traffic than normal
   single-carriageway roads and [13]boulevards.

[[27]edit] United Kingdom

   In the [28]UK, although the term dual carriageway applies to any road
   with physically separated lanes, it is frequently used as a descriptive
   term for [29]major routes built in this style. Such major dual
   carriageways usually have two lanes of traffic in each direction, with
   the lane nearest the centre being reserved for overtaking. Occasionally
   dual carriageways have only one lane in each direction, or more than
   two lanes each way (usually to permit easier overtaking of slower
   uphill traffic). Different speed limits apply on dual carriageway
   sections from those that apply on [30]single carriageway sections of
   the same class of road, except in cities and built-up areas where the
   dual carriageway is more of a safety measure, often intended to prevent
   [31]pedestrians from crossing a busy road.
   Diagram of types of road in the UK

   When first constructed, many dual carriageways - including the first
   motorways - had no crash or other barriers in the central reservation.
   Hence in the event of delays on the road, or if a driver missed his
   exit, there was a widespread problem of drivers making a U-turn onto
   the other carriageway; many accidents were caused as a result of their
   misjudging the speed of approaching traffic on the other carriageway
   when doing so. The majority of dual carriageway roads now have
   barriers. Some are heavy concrete obstructions which can have the
   effect of bouncing a vehicle back into the path of other traffic;
   others are made from steel ropes mounted on moderately weak posts,
   where the rope cuts into the vehicle body to slow the vehicle while
   keeping it against the barrier until it has stopped.

   Turning right (that is, across the line of traffic heading in the
   opposite direction) is usually permitted only at specific locations.
   Often the driver will be required to turn left (away from the dual
   carriageway) in order to loop around to an access road that permits
   crossing the major road. [32]Roundabouts on dual carriageways are
   relatively common, especially in cities or where the cost of a
   grade-separated junction would be prohibitive.

   A dual carriageway with grade-separated junctions and which meets other
   requirements may be upgraded to [33]motorway standard, denoted as an
   (M) added after the road number (e.g. "[34]A1(M)" or "[35]A38(M)").

[[36]edit] Confusion

   While most drivers are clear about what a [37]motorway is, some are
   confused about the definition of a dual carriageway. For a road to be
   classed as a dual carriageway, the two directions of [38]traffic flow
   must be physically separated by a [39]central reservation.^[40][1] A
   road where the two directions of flow are separated only by lines
   painted on the road surface is a single carriageway, regardless of the
   number of traffic lanes that may be available to the traffic in each
   direction. So a road with three or four lanes is not a dual carriageway
   if there is no central reservation.

[[41]edit] Speed limits

   The [42]national speed limit applies on dual carriageways (unless it is
   in a '[43]built up area', or a lower limit is posted), which is as
   follows:

   CAPTION: National speed limits on dual carriageways in the UK

   Type of vehicle Speed limit
   [44]Car, [45]motorcycle or a car-based [46]van up to 2 [47]metric
   tonnes 70 mph
   Car with [48]caravan or trailer 60 mph
   [49]Bus or [50]coach up to 12 m long 60 mph
   Goods vehicle up to 7.5 t 60 mph
   Goods vehicle over 7.5 t 50 mph

[[51]edit] Ireland

   A typical modern Irish dual carriageway (opened 2004) along the
   [52]N11, south of [53]Newtownmountkennedy. On motorways, the yellow
   hard shoulder markings are unbroken.
   An example of a 2+2 dual-carriageway in Ireland. This type is similar
   to many found in the UK.

   Although in the [54]Republic of Ireland the term dual carriageway
   technically applies to any road with physically separated lanes, it is
   usually used only to refer to those route sections that do not have a
   [55]motorway designation. Most often it is national roads (roads with a
   route number prefix of N; e.g. [56]N8) that are built as or upgraded to
   dual carriageway. A number of non-national roads (for example,
   [57]regional roads) are dual carriageway, for example in urban areas
   near or in cities, or where the road was formerly part of a national
   route.

   Dual carriageways of this class differ from motorways in a number of
   ways. The hard shoulder is demarcated with a dashed yellow line (as
   opposed to an unbroken yellow line on motorways). The standard speed
   limit of 100 km/h (62 mph) for national routes usually applies (by
   default the limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for non-national roads, even if
   dual carriageway). Local authorities have the power to apply a limit of
   up to 120 km/h (75 mph) as used on most motorways (as of 2008, the dual
   carriageway section of the [58]N2 north of the [59]M50 and the [60]high
   quality dual carriageway section of the [61]N1 between the end of the
   M1 and the border with [62]Northern Ireland are the only route sections
   with such special limits). Traffic lights and junctions are permitted
   at grade on dual carriageways. For older sections of dual carriageway,
   this has resulted in fewer flyover junctions. Newer dual carriageway
   sections are usually near motorway standard, with grade-separated
   junctions, but may not be designated as motorways due to the need to
   preserve access to adjoining property or to the absence of a
   non-motorway alternative route. Also, dual carriageways that are not
   motorway classified do not need to be equipped with emergency phones.

   Motorway restrictions only apply to motorway sections, rather than all
   dual carriageway sections of national roads (these are signposted with
   the N prefix on the route number, rather than M). Some [63]national
   secondary roads, and regional roads in particular often have houses,
   schools and other developments fronting on to them. Less important
   [64]national primary roads, and older sections not yet upgraded may
   also feature such developments built before the introduction the Irish
   Planning system in 1964. Today Irish planning policy prohibits such
   development on National Primary or National Secondary roads where the
   speed limit exceeds 60 km/h (37 mph). This policy results from concerns
   expressed by the National Roads Authority. However, a [65]local
   authority is not obliged to implement this policy and can disregard
   this policy at it own discretion. This would usually only occur in
   exceptional circumstances or where planners are over ruled by elected
   councillors using section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001.
   Accordingly, [66]hard shoulders are included wherever feasible to
   provide for the resulting pedestrian and cyclist traffic, and are
   present on much of the national route network. These hard shoulders may
   also be used as running lanes by motorised traffic under certain
   conditions.

   Until 2004/2005, many motorways and dual carriageways in Ireland did
   not have crash barriers in the central reservation, the policy being to
   use a wider median instead. Crash barriers are now mandatory for such
   routes, and wire cabling or full crash barriers (depending on whether
   or not the route is a motorway, and median width) have been fitted to
   existing routes.

   As of 2008^[67][update] three major types of dual carriageway are being
   built on national road schemes in the Republic of Ireland:
     * [68]High Quality Dual Carriageways (HQDC) - these are being built
       mainly on the major inter-urban routes, to full [69]motorway
       standard but without motorway regulations. The Roads Act 2007
       allows for these roads to be redesignated as motorways by
       ministerial order. Many of the sections of HQDC on the major
       inter-urban routes have been redesignated as motorways and full
       motorway regulations will apply when the redesignations come into
       effect.
     * Standard dual carriageway of the traditional type is mainly planned
       for schemes on the [70]N11 road, the [71]N18 road and the [72]N25
       road. Plans for this type of dual carriageway on the [73]N20 road
       have been superseded by newer plans to build a motorway, the M20,
       to replace most of this route. Traditionally this type of
       dual-carriageway had a mixture of at grade junctions (including
       [74]roundabouts), grade separated junctions, and median crossings.
       Nowadays they are similar to HQDCs, but minor at grade exits -
       generally left turn only - are allowed and the design speed (by
       Irish standards) is only 100 km/h. Median crossings and roundabouts
       are no longer generally found on these schemes. An example of a
       standard dual carriageway scheme, opened in 2006, is the [75]Ennis
       bypass although this road has grade separated junctions and no
       median crossings.
     * [76]2+2 roads - officially these roads are designated as Type 2
       dual carriageways by the [77]National Roads Authority (NRA). They
       will be created by widening existing roads or building new roads,
       and will have two lanes in each direction with a steel cable crash
       barrier in the middle but no hard shoulder. Most junctions will be
       at grade. With the exception of the restricted median width and the
       lack of lay-bys, this type of dual carriageway is similar to many
       dual carriageways found in the UK. The first 2+2 scheme (and the
       only example as of 2008), the N4 [78]Dromod [79]Roosky bypass,
       opened on [80]7 December [81]2007 [82][1].
     * [83]2+1 roads - officially these roads are designated as Type 3
       dual carriageways by the NRA. They have two lanes in one direction
       and one lane in the other, alternating every few kilometres, and
       usually separated with a steel cable barrier. Sections of 2+1 road
       have been built on the N20 and the [84]N2. In July 2007, the NRA
       announced that it would no longer build 2+1 roads and 2+2 roads
       will be built instead.

[[85]edit] North America

   In the U.S. this type of road may be called a divided highway and has a
   median between the traffic directions. With few exceptions, all roads
   in the federally funded [86]Interstate Highway System are
   limited-access divided highways, also known as [87]freeways and
   [88]expressways. [89]United States Numbered Highways, state highways
   and other locally maintained highways may also be divided. Speed limits
   on rural [90]divided highways in the United States can be as fast as
   75 mph and on some freeways the speed limit is [91]80 mph. Urban
   divided highways which are [92]at grade and typically have much lower
   speed limits are sometimes called [93]boulevards.
   A divided highway ([94]US Route 52) in the state of Indiana.

   In [95]Canada, both "divided highway" and "dual carriageway" may be
   used for this type of road, although "divided highway" is more common
   (as "dual carriageway" is an older term being used less than it used to
   be); however, the segment between the roadways is always a "median"
   rather than a "central reservation". On some portions of [96]Ontario's
   [97]400-series highway network, the median may be an [98]Ontario
   tall-wall barrier rather than an unpaved strip.

   Junctions may be at-grade or [99]grade-separated, and there may be gaps
   in the median strip to allow turning and crossing. Divided highways are
   seldom equipped with [100]traffic circles, roundabouts or rotaries.

[[101]edit] China

   The best examples of dual carriageways in [102]mainland China can be
   seen on the [103]China National Highways. On some routes, such as
   [104]China National Highway 106, there is a central reservation.

[[105]edit] Croatia

   Dual carriageways or expressways in [106]Croatia ([107]Croatian: brza
   cesta) are non-[108]tolled roads with 2 or more lanes in each
   direction, but without emergency lanes. Because of the lack of tolls
   normally seen on many Croatian highways, the use of dual carriageways
   is highly encouraged. Many bypasses and beltways of smaller cities in
   Croatia have been recently constructed or planned as dual carriageways.
   All dual carriageways in Croatia house a central median, usually fitted
   with guardrails.

   The most heavily used dual carriageway in Croatia is the [109]B28
   expressway, connecting capital [110]Zagreb to a [111]satellite town,
   [112]Vrbovec. The D28 is currently finished up to the [113]Gradec
   interchange. It is undergoing extensions which will increase the
   traffic traversing it.

[[114]edit] Singapore

   A high proportion of roads in Singapore are dual carriageways with
   central reservations; examples include Clementi Road, Commonwealth
   Avenue and Holland Road. Often there might be railings erected on the
   central reservation to prevent pedestrians from dashing across the
   road. These usually have traffic lights along the way but flyovers and
   road tunnels (or 'underpasses') can be built to minimise the use of
   traffic lights; for example, at the Holland Road-Farrer Road-Queensway
   junction there are three levels of roads. Before the 1980s roundabouts
   were popular but since then many have been changed to traffic-light
   controlled junctions.

   These dual carriageways are to be distinguished from motorways, known
   in Singapore as expressways such as the [115]Pan-Island Expressway
   (PIE) and [116]Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) where no traffic lights are
   used.

[[117]edit] Australia

   A typical dual carriageway in [118]Melbourne, Australia.

   Examples of dual carriageways on non-urban roads in Australia include
   the [119]Hume Highway and the [120]Pacific Highway (Australia); the
   Hume Highway by 2012, will be 100% dual carriageway and the Pacific
   Highway by 2016 will also be 100% dual carriageway. Today, 90% of the
   Hume Highway is dual carriageway and only 40% or 280 km (174 mi) of the
   Pacific Highway is dual carriageway, plus 10% of the Pacific Highway or
   78 kilometres (48 miles) is under construction. The [121]Federal
   Highway between the [122]Hume Highway at [123]Goulburn and
   [124]Canberra is 100% dual carriageway, completed before the 2000
   Summer Olympic Games. Some parts of the [125]Princes Highway,
   [126]Great Western Highway (A32) and the [127]Barton Highway are also
   dual carriageway. Most non-urban dual carriageway highways/freeways are
   speed limited to 110 km/h (100 km/h for heavy vehicles), except for a
   short section in the [128]Australian Capital Territory on the
   [129]Federal Highway which is state limited to 100 km/h.

[[136]edit] History

   A very early example (perhaps the first) of a dual carriageway was the
   [137]Via Portuensis, built in the 1st century by the Roman emperor
   [138]Claudius between [139]Rome and its port [140]Ostia at the mouth of
   the [141]Tiber.

   In 1907 the [142]Long Island Parkway opened and roughly 20% of it
   featured a semi-dual carriageway design. The [143]New York City parkway
   system, which was built between 1907 and 1934, also pioneered the same
   design. However the majority of it featured concrete or brick railings
   as lane dividers as opposed to using grass medians.

   In 1924 the first Italian autostrada was opened running 55 km (34 mi)
   from Milan to Varese. It featured a broad road bed and did not feature
   lane dividers except near cities and through the mountains.
   ^[144][2]^[145][3]

   The London end of the [146]Great West Road became Britain's first dual
   carriageway when it was opened in 1925 by King George V [147][2].

   In 1927 the Rome bypass was opened. It ran 92 km (57 mi) bypassing Rome
   to the east. Almost the entire length featured a dual carriageway
   design. In the early 1930s it was extended southward all the way to
   [148]Naples and northward to Florence. Most of the original routing was
   destroyed by the Allies in the Second World War.
   A German dual carriageway in the 1930s

   By 1930 several American and European cities had built dual carriageway
   highways mostly to control traffic jams and/or to provide bypass routes
   for traffic.

   In 1932 the first German [149]Autobahn opened between Cologne and Bonn.
   It ran 21 km (13 mi) and paved the way for future highways. Although
   it, like the first Autostrada, did not feature a dual carriageway
   design, it inspired the mass construction of future high speed
   roadways.

   During the 1930s, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union began
   construction of a network of dual carriageway expressways. By 1942,
   Germany had over 3,200 km (2,000 mi) of dual carriageway roads, Italy
   had nearly 1,300 km (800 mi), and the Soviet Union had 400 km (250 mi).

   What may be the world's first long-distance [150]intercity dual
   carriageway/freeway is the [151]Queen Elizabeth Way in [152]Southern
   [153]Ontario in [154]Canada, initially linking the large cities of
   [155]Toronto and [156]Hamilton together by 1939, with construction on
   this stretch of the present-day Queen Elizabeth Way beginning in 1936
   as "Middle Road".

   In 1940 the [157]Pennsylvania Turnpike was opened to traffic and at
   160 miles (257 km) long it was the first rural dual carriageway built
   in the United States. By 1955 several states had built dual carriageway
   freeways and turnpikes and in 1957 the [158]Interstate Highway System
   began. Completed in 1994, the major highway system links all the major
   cities of the United States.
