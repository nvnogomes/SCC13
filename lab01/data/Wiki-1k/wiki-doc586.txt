   Durrs (also known by several [30]alternative names) is the second
   largest city of [31]Albania. It is the most ancient and one of the most
   economically important cities of [32]Albania. It is located on the
   central Albanian coast at [33]4119N 1927E / 41.317N 19.45E / 41.317;
   19.45[34]Coordinates: [35]4119N 1927E / 41.317N 19.45E / 41.317; 19.45,
   about 33 km (20 miles) west of the capital [36]Tirana. It is situated
   at one of the narrower points of the [37]Adriatic Sea, opposite the
   [38]Italian ports of [39]Bari (300 km away) and [40]Brindisi (200 km
   away). It has a population of around 114,000 (as of 2003^[41][update]
   estimate). The city of Durrs is home to Albania's newest public
   university, the [42]Aleksander Moisiu University.

[[55]edit] Names

   In the past few decades, the [56]Albanian name of the city, Durrs
   (Durrsi), has gradually replaced the widespread use of the [57]Italian
   name Durazzo.

   The city has been known by many other names in different languages due
   to its varied colorful history, including the [58]Greek names Epidamnos
   () and Dyrhacchion (), the Latin Dyrrachium, the Bulgarian, Macedonian
   and Serbian Drach or Dra (), the Ottoman Turkish Dra and the Italian
   Durazzo.

   For other names by which Durrs is known, see [59]other names of Durrs.

[[60]edit] History

   The city was founded as Epidamnos in 627 BC by [61]Greek^[62][3]
   colonists from [63]Corinth and [64]Corcyra. Its geographical position
   was highly advantageous, being situated around a natural rocky harbour
   which was surrounded by inland swamps and high cliffs on the seaward
   side, making the city very difficult to attack from either land or sea.
   Epidamnos was noted for being a politically advanced society, prompting
   the ancient philosopher [65]Aristotle to praise its political system.
   However, Corinth and Corcyra quarrelled over the city, helping to
   precipitate the [66]Peloponnesian War in 431 BC.

[[67]edit] Roman and Byzantine rule

   Durrs Harbor

   Epidamnos was seized by [68]Glaukias, the king of [69]Illyria, in 312
   BC, but after a [70]war with the [71]Roman Republic in 229 BC ended in
   a decisive defeat for the Illyrians the city passed to Roman rule,
   under which it was developed as a major military and naval base. The
   Romans renamed it Dyrrachium ([72]Greek: / Dyrrhachion). They
   considered the name Epidamnos to be inauspicious because of its wholly
   coincidental similarities with the Latin word damnum, meaning "loss" or
   "harm". The meaning of Dyrrachium ("bad spine" or "difficult ridge" in
   Greek) is unclear but it has been suggested that it refers to the
   imposing cliffs near the city. [73]Julius Caesar's rival [74]Pompey
   made a stand there in 48 BC before fleeing south to [75]Greece. Under
   Roman rule, Dyrrachium prospered; it became the western end of the
   [76]Via Egnatia, the great [77]Roman road that led to [78]Thessalonica
   and on to [79]Constantinople. Another lesser road led south to the city
   of Buthrotum, the modern [80]Butrint. The Roman emperor [81]Caesar
   Augustus made the city a colony for veterans of his [82]legions
   following the [83]Battle of Actium, proclaiming it a [84]civitas libera
   (free town).

   In the 4th century AD, Dyrrachium was made the capital of the [85]Roman
   province of [86]Epirus nova. It was the birthplace of the emperor
   [87]Anastasius I in circa 430. Some time later that century, Dyrrachium
   was struck by a powerful earthquake which destroyed the city's
   defences. Anastasius I rebuilt and strengthened the city walls, thus
   creating the strongest fortifications in the western Balkans. The 12m
   (36ft)-high walls were so thick that, according to the Byzantine
   historian [88]Anna Komnene, four horsemen could ride abreast on them.
   Significant portions of the ancient city defences still remain,
   although they have been much reduced over the centuries.

   Like much of the rest of the [89]Balkans, Dyrrachium and the
   surrounding Dyrraciensis provinciae suffered considerably from
   [90]barbarian incursions during the [91]Migrations Period. It was
   besieged in 481 by [92]Theodoric the Great, king of the [93]Ostrogoths,
   and in subsequent centuries had to fend off frequent attacks by the
   [94]Bulgarians. Unaffected by the [95]fall of the Western Roman Empire,
   the city continued under the [96]Byzantine Empire as an important port
   and a major link between the Empire and western Europe.

[[97]edit] Middle Ages

   The [98]First Bulgarian Empire under [99]Simeon the Great captured the
   city, together with most of what is today Albania, in the early 10th
   century, but the Byzantines reconquered it around the middle of the
   century, when Bulgaria was under [100]Peter I. The very end of the
   century saw another period of Bulgarian control, when under [101]Samuel
   the empire conquered the city and held it until 1018. Dyrrachium (then
   known as , Drach in Bulgarian) remained as one of the last Bulgarian
   fortresses as the Byzantine Empire subjugated Bulgaria.

   Dyrrachium was lost in February 1082 by the emperor [102]Alexios I
   Komnenos, who was defeated at the hands of the [103]Normans
   ([104]Robert Guiscard and his son [105]Bohemund (see [106]Battle of
   Dyrrhachium (1081)). Byzantine control was restored the following
   century following the defeat of Bohemund in 1107 but the city was lost
   again in 1185, this time to the Norman King [107]William II of Sicily.
   In 1202, during the [108]Fourth Crusade, the city was transferred to
   the rule of the [109]Republic of Venice. It passed into the hands of
   [110]Manfred of Sicily and then [111]Charles I of Sicily (Charles of
   Anjou) in 1268.

   Five years later, in ca. 1273, it was wrecked by a devastating
   [112]earthquake (according to [113]George Pachymeres; R. Elsie, Early
   Albania (2003), p. 12), but soon recovered and became an independent
   [114]duchy under the rule of Charles' grandson [115]John of Anjou. It
   later came under the rule of [116]Philip I of Taranto. In 1333 it was
   annexed to the Frankish [117]Principality of Achaea before falling to
   the [118]Serbian Tsar [119]Stefan Duan in 1336. When Duan died in 1355,
   the city passed into the hands of the Albanian family of Thopias.

   The [120]Republic of Venice regained control in 1392 and retained the
   city, known as Durazzo in those years, as part of the [121]Albania
   Veneta. It fended off a siege by the [122]Ottoman Sultan [123]Mehmed II
   in 1466 but fell to them in 1501.

   Durrs became a [124]Christian city quite early on; its [125]bishopric
   was created around AD 58 and was raised to the status of an
   [126]archbishopric in 449. It is also the seat of a [127]Greek Orthodox
   [128]metropolitan bishop. Under Turkish rule, many of its inhabitants
   converted to [129]Islam and many [130]mosques were erected. This city
   was renamed as Dra, the city did not prosper under the Ottomans and its
   importance declined greatly. By the mid-19th century, its population
   was said to have been only about 1,000 people living in some 200
   households. Its decrepitude was noted by foreign observers in the early
   20th century: "The walls are dilapidated; plane-trees grow on the
   gigantic ruins of its old Byzantine citadel; and its harbour, once
   equally commodious and safe, is gradually becoming silted up."^[131][4]

[[132]edit] 20th century

   The palace of King [133]Ahmet Zog I in Durrs

   Durrs was an active city in the Albanian national liberation movement
   in the periods 1878-1881 and 1910-1912. [134]Ismail Qemali raised the
   [135]Albanian flag on November 26, 1912 but the city was captured by
   the [136]Serbs three days later during the [137]First Balkan War. The
   city became [138]Albania's first national capital on March 7, 1913
   under the brief rule of Prince [139]William of Wied.

   During the [140]First World War, the city was occupied by [141]Italy in
   1915 and by [142]Austria-Hungary in 1916-1918. It was captured by the
   [143]Allies in October 1918. Restored to Albanian sovereignty, Durrs
   became the country's temporary capital between 1918 and March 1920. It
   experienced an economic boom due to Italian investments and developed
   into a major seaport under the rule of King [144]Zog, with a modern
   harbour being constructed in 1927.

   An earthquake in 1926 damaged some of the city and the rebuilding that
   followed gave the city its more modern appearance. During the 1930s,
   the [145]Bank of Athens had a branch in the city.

   The [146]Second World War saw Durrs (called Durazzo again in Italian)
   and the rest of Albania being annexed to the [147]Kingdom of Italy
   between 1939-1943, then occupied by [148]Nazi Germany until 1944.
   Durrs's strategic value as a seaport made it a high-profile military
   target for both sides. It was the site of the initial Italian landings
   on 7 April 1939 as well as the launch point for the ill-fated Italian
   invasion of Greece. The city was heavily damaged by [149]Allied bombing
   during the war and the port installations were blown up by the
   retreating Germans in 1944.

   The [150]Communist regime of [151]Enver Hoxha rapidly rebuilt the city
   following the war, establishing a variety of heavy industries in the
   area and expanding the port. It became the terminus of Albania's first
   [152]railway, begun in 1947. In the late 1980s the city was briefly
   renamed Durrs-Enver Hoxha.

   Following the collapse of communist rule in 1990, Durrs became the
   focus of mass emigrations from Albania with ships being hijacked in the
   harbour and sailed at gunpoint to Italy. In one month alone, August
   1991, over 20,000 people migrated to Italy in this fashion. Italy
   intervened militarily, putting the port area under its control, and the
   city became the centre of the [153]European Community's "[154]Operation
   Pelican", a food-aid programme.

   In 1997, Albania slid into anarchy following the collapse of a massive
   [155]pyramid scheme which devastated the national economy. An
   Italian-led peacekeeping force was controversially deployed to Durrs
   and other Albanian cities to restore order, although there were
   widespread suggestions that the real purpose of "[156]Operation Alba"
   was to prevent economic refugees continuing to use Albania's ports as a
   route to migrate to Italy.

   During the 1999 [157]Kosovo War the city hosted some 110,000 refugees
   fleeing fighting in [158]Kosovo and became a base of operations for
   much of the [159]refugee response by [160]aid agencies in Albania.

[[161]edit] Economy

   Durrs is still an important link to [162]Western Europe due to its port
   and its proximity to the Italian port cities, notably Bari, to which
   daily ferries run. As well as the dockyard, it also possess an
   important shipyard and manufacturing industries, notably producing
   leather, plastic and tobacco products. The neighbouring district also
   produces wine and a variety of foodstuffs.

[[163]edit] Sights

   Some important buildings in Durrs include the main library, the
   cultural center with the [164]Aleksander Moisiu theater, the
   [165]Estrada Theater, the puppet theater, the philharmonic orchestra,
   etc. There are also several museums such as the Archaeological Museum
   and the Museum of History.

   The city's beaches are also a popular destination for many foreign and
   local tourists, with an estimated 600,000 tourists visiting annually.
   Many Albanians from Tirana spend their summer vacations on the beaches
   of Durrs.

   Due to the recent construction of a modern highway linking Tirana and
   Durrs, the travel time is only approximately 30 minutes. You can also
   make the journey by train, for the token charge of 50 leke (about US$
   0.40). There are roughly ten trains a day from Tirana.

   As in other parts of Albania, numerous concrete bunkers built under the
   old dictatorship are situated in and around Durrs. They can be found
   every 100 to 150 meters along the city's beach. They were built to
   defend the country from a supposed foreign attack from either the West
   or the Warsaw Pact which never happened; Albania now has an estimated
   700,000 bunkers.

   The largest amphitheatre in the Balkans is located in the city close to
   the harbour.

[[166]edit] Climate

   Durrs has a generally [167]Mediterranean climate. The average
   temperature varies from a low of 5C in January to a high of 28C in July
   and August. The driest months are June, July and August, each with less
   than 1cm of precipitation on average, while the rest of the year sees
   monthly precipitation over 2cm.
