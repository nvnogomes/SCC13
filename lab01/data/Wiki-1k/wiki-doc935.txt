   [8]Bas-relief from the [9]Pilgrim Monument depicting the signing of the
   Mayflower Compact.

   Edward Fuller (baptized [10]4 September [11]1575; died between [12]11
   January and [13]10 April [14]1621) crossed the [15]Atlantic on the
   [16]Mayflower with his wife and his 12 year old son, Samuel. Also
   accompanying the family was Edward's brother Dr. Samuel Fuller. Edward
   Fuller was the twenty-first signer of the [17]Mayflower Compact. Both
   Edward Fuller and his wife died during the first winter in [18]Plymouth
   Colony. Samuel survived and lived with his uncle after the death of his
   parents.

[[19]edit] Family

   Edward, born in the Parish of Redenhall, co. Norfolk, England, was the
   son of Robert and Sarah (Dunkhorn) Fuller. Edward's wife is commonly
   believed to be named Ann though no historic documentation exists
   supporting this name. Edward and his wife had two sons: Mathew and
   Samuel. Samuel traveled with his parents on the Mayflower. Mathew,
   however, traveled to Plymouth in about 1640 with his wife and three
   children. Descendants of his brother still live around the Plymouth
   area to this day.

[[20]edit] Famous descendants

   Famous descendants include [21]Melville Weston Fuller, [22]Joseph
   Smith, Jr., [23]David Souter, [24]Georgia O'Keeffe, and [25]Erskine
   Hamilton Childers. Smith descends from Edward's son Samuel who married
   [26]John Lothropp's daughter Jane.^[[27]citation needed]
