[[27]edit] EBSCOhost

   EBSCOhost is a subscription-based service provided by EBSCO Publishing.
   It is widely-accessible via private and public databases in libraries
   and schools. EBSCOhost is an umbrella term for various other databases
   which provide full text searches and abstracts of magazines, newspapers
   and reference books in a variety of subject areas, updated on a daily
   basis. Libraries and other institutions subscribe to EBSCOhost, and
   optionally choose one or more of the offered databases as part of their
   subscription. Customers can then search all of the subscribed
   databases, or focus their search on a subset.

   Some databases have overlapping information, and are targeted to
   different sectors of the market, such as libraries, K-12 schools,
   corporations, government institutions, universities, or medical
   institutions. As of 2008, over 200 possible databases are available,
   such as:
     * Academic Search Elite: Full text for over 3,500 journals, most of
       which are peer-reviewed titles, some dating back to 1985
     * MasterFILE Elite: covers general reference, business, and health.
     * MasterFILE Premier: Full text for more than 1,750 general reference
       publications, some dating back to 1975, plus 500 full text
       reference books, full text from 86,019 biographies, 105,787 full
       text primary source documents, and an Image Collection of 293,480
       photos, maps and flags.
     * Primary Search: Targeted towards elementary school students
     * EBSCO Animals: Coverage of common animals, including their habitats
     * EBSCO Online Citations: Access to electronic journals and articles
       from EBSCO Online

       encyclopedic entries

     * MagillOnLiterature Plus, produced by [29]Salem Press, a combination

       biographies, and author essays.
     * MAS Ultra - School Edition: Full text for over 500 high school
       magazines, 360 reference books, over 85,000 biographies, 104,000

       maps, flags, and full text backfiles to 1975 for key magazines.

[[30]edit] Health databases

   A few of the databases targeting the health reference sector:
     * Health Source Plus: Coverage of health issues.
     * Health Source: Consumer Edition
     * Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition
     * USP DI Volume II, Advice for the Patient: Provides drug information
       organized into subsections on brands, usage information,
       precautions, and side effects.
     * Clinical Reference Systems: Information about symptoms, treatments,
       risks and after-effects of various medical conditions
     * AltHealthWatch

[[31]edit] EBSCO A-to-Z

   EBSCO A-to-Z, different from EBSCOhost, is a tool marketed to
   libraries. It allows the libraries to list all of their electronic
   resources, including journals, databases, electronic books, and any
   other local resources, into one database which represents data from all
   major database vendors and publishers, with information on over 216,000
   unique titles from nearly 2,000 databases and e-journal packages.
   Clients can then search for any journal or resource and see which
   database it is in.
