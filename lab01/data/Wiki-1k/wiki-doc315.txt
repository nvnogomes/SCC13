From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   Jump to: [6]navigation, [7]search

   Downtown Victoria is a neighbourhood of [8]Victoria, British Columbia
   that acts as the commercial and entertainment hub of the city and
   surrounding region.

   The downtown area is an extremely popular place for tourists and local
   Victorians as that is where many of the movie theatres, stage theatres,
   hotels, restaurants, pubs, night clubs, and shops are. Many tourist
   attractions are located in and around the area including [9]Bastion
   Square, heart of the 19th Century city's professional district.
   [10]Centennial Square is next to Victoria [11]City Hall; it is used for
   small venue events such as the [12]Electronic Music Festival, which
   takes place during the same time period as the [13]BC Day [14]statutory
   holiday and [15]Symphony Splash. [16]Market Square, towards the
   northwest end of downtown, is used for small venue concerts and
   festivals, containing shopping establishments and eateries and is part
   of the city's "Old Town". Just beyond Market Square and Old Town which
   is the cultural and historic [17]Chinatown, Victoria and forms part of
   the northern end of downtown Victoria. It has a colourful [18]Chinese
   historical past from the early days of Victoria.

   Downtown Victoria contains most of [19]Greater Victoria's and the
   [20]Capital Regional District's urban high rise office towers. They
   house the local [21]head offices of multinational banks, government
   agencies, private agencies, and other types of organizations. In recent
   years, many expensive, large condominium complexes were built or are
   being built to attract more residents to downtown. The goal of these
   projects is to increase the permanent resident base, to support the
   downtown economy.

   The [22]Bay Centre shopping mall is located in the middle of downtown.
   [23]Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre, located on the site of the former
   [24]Victoria Memorial Arena, is the largest sports-entertainment
   multiplex on [25]Vancouver Island and the second largest in [26]British
   Columbia outside of the [27]Metro Vancouver area^[[28]citation needed].
