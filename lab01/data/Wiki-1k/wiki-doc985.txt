   Egan's Rats
   In [8]St. Louis, Missouri, [9]United States
   Founded by [10]Thomas Kinney and [11]William Egan
   Years active 1890-1924
   Territory [12]St. Louis-[13]Kansas City, Missouri
   Ethnicity [14]Irish-American
   Membership 300-400 (est. 1912)
   Criminal activities [15]Organized crime
   Rivals [16]Bottoms Gang
   Hogan Gang

   Egan's Rats was an American street gang that exercised considerable
   power in [17]St. Louis, Missouri from 1890 to 1924. Its 34 years of
   criminal activity included bootlegging, labor slugging, voter
   intimidation, armed robbery, and murder. Although predominantly
   [18]Irish-American, Egan's Rats did include a few [19]Italian-Americans
   and some [20]Jewish immigrants from [21]Eastern Europe, most notably,
   [22]Max "Big Maxie" Greenberg.

   Formed by [23]Thomas "Snake" Kinney and [24]William "Jellyroll" Egan,
   the gang quickly became the dominant criminal organization in St. Louis
   especially around the [25]turn of the century when they were hired out
   as "legbreakers" to break up [26]strikes and other [27]labor union
   activities. As the practice of labor racketeering, or "labor slugging",
   became less profitable following the US entry into the [28]First World
   War, the gang also entered into bootlegging during Prohibition. Under
   the leadership of the colorful [29]Dinty Colbeck, the gang controlled
   bootlegging in the [30]St. Louis[31]Kansas City area as well as
   financed a number of major [32]jewelry robberies with the help of
   [33]safecracker [34]Red Rudensky. Members of Egan's Rats were also
   hired out as freelance gunmen and [35]contract killers. It was widely
   suspected that the several of the gang, including [36]Fred "Trigger"
   Burke, were involved in the [37]St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The gang
   later made headlines when gang member [38]Leo Vincent Brothers was
   convicted of the murder of [39]Chicago Tribune reporter [40]Jake Lingle
   in June 1930.

   Like many other the Prohibition gangs however, Egan's Rats were unable
   to adapt to the Depression-era underworld and found themselves
   eventually pushed out from other criminal activities now dominated by
   the [41]National Crime Syndicate. After the arrest and conviction of
   Colbeck and other high level members in 1924, the gang slowly declined
   in power and disappeared after the end of Prohibition in [42]1932.

[[52]edit] History

[[53]edit] Up from the streets

   Egan's Rats was founded around 1890 by [54]Thomas "Snake" Kinney and
   [55]Thomas Egan, two street toughs living in the riverfront "Kerry
   Patch" neighborhood of St. Louis. Recruiting other members from the
   neighborhood, the Rats started out as pickpockets, burglars, and armed
   robbers. The gang also aided the [56]Democratic Party political machine
   by intimidating voters at polling places on Election Day. Kinney used
   the gang as a stepping stone into politics. He first served as the
   Fourth Wards delegate in to the Missouri House of Delegates and later
   served in the Missouri State Senate.

   In contrast, Tom Egan stayed in the old neighborhood and became the
   main leader of the increasingly powerful Rats. By 1904, Egan's Rats was
   the most powerful street gang in St. Louis. Their only rival at this
   time was the violent [57]Bottoms Gang from the Twenty-second Ward.
   However, the Bottoms Gang made the mistake of assaulting police
   officers and were soon forced out of existence. Ruthless killers, the
   Rats Gang was willing to assassinate anyone, regardless of the
   consequences. On [58]June 4, [59]1909, the Rats murdered rival gunman
   [60]Fred "Yellow Kid" Mohrle in the Four Courts Building while he was
   on trial for killing Egan gangster Sam Young.

[[61]edit] The Heyday

   By 1912, Tom Egan headed an organization of 300 to 400 men. That same
   year, he gave an astounding interview to the [62]St. Louis
   Post-Dispatch in which he flaunted his power and underworld status.
   With Kinneys death from [63]tuberculosis that year, Tom Egan moved the
   gang into more sophisticated rackets. Correctly suspecting that alcohol
   consumption would soon be prohibited in the United States, Tom Egan set
   up a liquor smuggling network in St. Louis.

   By early 1916, the Egan's Rats went to war with the depleted Bottoms
   Gang. The main cause was disgruntled Egan gangster [64]Harry "Cherries"
   Dunn, who was angry that Tom Egan did little to help his imprisoned
   brother [65]John. Dunn shot and killed original Egan gang member
   [66]William "Skippy" Rohan inside Tom Egan's saloon on [67]January 8,
   [68]1916. Tom's brother Willie successfully argued to spare Dunn's
   life. "Cherries" defected to the Bottoms Gang and instigated a
   full-blown war on [69]August 21, [70]1916, when he killed Harry Romani,
   a semi-pro boxer and crook who was allied with the Egan gang.

   Willie Egan and four of his men confronted Cherries Dunn at the Typo
   Press Club on [71]September 19, [72]1916. [73]Walter Costello and
   [74]Frank "Gutter" Newman shot and killed him. The war between the Egan
   and Bottoms gangs claimed almost a dozen lives, including both of Harry
   Dunn's murderers.

   Despite the passage of a [75]Prohibition law, Tom Egan was unable to
   reap the full benefits of his liquor smuggling ring. Tom died of
   [76]Bright's Disease on [77]April 20, [78]1919.

[[79]edit] Changing Of The Guard

   After Tom Egan's death in 1919, Egan's Rats was taken over by his
   younger brother, [80]Willie. Unfortunately, Willie wasnt a natural
   leader like his brother. As a result, younger gang members became
   restless. While Egan wanted to build up the bootlegging business for
   longterm profits, the younger members wanted the quicker payoffs of
   armed robberies. Rebelling against Egan, these youthful gangsters,
   known as red hots, began robbing up banks, armored cars, and messengers
   with lightning rapidity. Their known first bank robbery, that of the
   Baden Bank on [81]April 10, [82]1919, netted over $59,000 dollars.

   By 1921, these disputes worsened when Max "Big Maxie" Greenberg, a
   dissatisfied Egan's Rats member, double-crossed Willie Egan over a
   shipment of whiskey. In retaliation, Egan unsuccessfully attempted to
   kill Greenberg. At this point, Max defected to a new rival, the Hogan
   Gang. The Hogan Gang was headed by Egan archrival, [83]Edward "Jelly
   Roll" Hogan, who also served as the Missouri State Beverage Inspector.
   On [84]October 31, [85]1921, Willie Egan was gunned down in front of
   his Franklin Avenue saloon. The Hogan Gang were considered to be the
   likely suspects.

[[86]edit] Ultra-Violence

   With the murder of Willie Egan in 1921, [87]William "Dint" Colbeck took
   over Egans Rats. A former plumber and World War I infantryman, Colbeck
   aggressively led Egan's Rats against the Hogans. Shootings swept the
   city, with both gangsters and innocent bystanders being killed on the
   streets. In the midst of it all, Colbeck maintained the gangs rackets.
   Headquartered at a St. Louis County roadhouse named the Maxwelton Club,
   the Rats increasingly looked toward their armed robberies for income.
   It would later be estimated that the Rats stole nearly $4.5 million
   dollars worth in cash and property in a five-year period. One of their
   biggest capers, committed with members of the [88]Cuckoo Gang, was the
   robbery of a mail truck in downtown St. Louis on [89]April 2, [90]1923.
   The heist netted the two gangs $2.4 million dollars in cash and
   negotiable bonds.

   By the summer of 1923, Egan's Rats was at its pinnacle of power. The
   Rats forced the battered Hogan Gang to sign a peace treaty. Now at
   peace, the Rats commenced a crime wave of robbery and murder in
   Missouri and Illinois. The gang was ruthless with anyone who crossed
   them, including their own members.

   In 1924, Egan's Rats would suffer a crushing blow. Fearful for his
   life, imprisoned gang member [91]Ray Renard started cooperating with
   federal prosecuters. On [92]November 15, [93]1924, Colbeck, [94]Louis
   "Red" Smith, Steve Ryan, [95]David "Chippy" Robinson, [96]Oliver
   Dougherty, [97]Frank Hackethal, [98]Charles "Red" Lanham, [99]Gus
   Dietmeyer, and [100]Frank "Cotton" Epplesheimer, were convicted of mail
   robbery and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.

[[101]edit] Gang breakup

   With the 1924 convictions of Colbeck and his associates, the Egan Rats
   Gang fell apart. The gang members who hadn't gone to prison scattered
   across the country, wreaking havoc wherever they went. One crew of
   ex-Rats, led by [102]Fred "Killer" Burke, committed numerous robberies,
   kidnappings, and contract murders throughout the American [103]Midwest.
   This crew allegedly took part in the infamous 1929 [104]St. Valentines
   Day Massacre of seven gangsters in Chicago. Another ex-Rat, [105]Leo
   Vincent Brothers, was convicted of killing [106]Chicago Tribune
   reporter [107]Jake Lingle in 1930. Two other former members, Pete and
   [108]Thomas "Yonnie" Licavoli, started the River Gang, a large
   [109]Detroit bootlegging gang that would dominate rackets in both
   Detroit and [110]Toledo, Ohio. A former Rat named [111]Elmer Macklin
   would murder Detroit mob boss [112]Chester LaMare in February 1931.

   By the early 1940s, Colbeck and most of the imprisoned gang members had
   been set free. They returned to a St. Louis that had changed over the
   past 20 years. Colbeck and some other gang members tried to muscle
   their way back into power. Most of them went to work for local mob boss
   [113]Frank Buster Wortman and eventually retired peacefully. However,
   William Dint Colbeck was machine-gunned to death while driving down a
   St. Louis street on [114]February 17, [115]1943.
