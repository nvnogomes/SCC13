[[59]edit] History

   Doniphan County was established [60]August 25, [61]1855, and organized
   on [62]September 18, [63]1855. It is named for the U.S. cavalry
   commander Colonel [64]Alexander W. Doniphan (1808-1887) of [65]Liberty,
   [66]Missouri, who played an important part in the [67]Mexican-American
   War. He was a zealous partisan in the failed effort made to extend
   slavery into Kansas.

   See also: [68]Doniphan County history reprinted from William G.
   Cutler's History of the State of Kansas (Chicago: A.T. Andreas, 1883).

[[69]edit] Law and government

   Doniphan County is served by a [70]Board of County Commissioners
   composed of one elected official from each of three districts. The
   commissioners serve four-year terms with the 2nd and 3rd district
   [71]elections following two years after the 1st district election. The
   Board is responsible for setting the county's policies, procedures, and
   budgets as well as overseeing functions of their respective Road and
   Bridge Shops. The Board also acts as the [72]Board of County Canvassers
   and canvass votes cast at each election. The county has adopted
   comprehensive county planning and [73]zoning codes. The cities are
   governed by [74]mayors and [75]city councils. Government services are
   paid for through a [76]sales tax, [77]property tax, and ad valorem tax
   [78]mill levy.

   Although the [79]Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the
   sale of alcoholic liquor by the individual drink with the approval of
   voters, Doniphan County has remained a prohibition, or [80]"dry",
   county.^[81][3]

   In Presidential elections Doniphan county has favored the Republican
   for, at least, the last thirteen election^[82][4] and possibly since
   statehood.^[83][5] In the last four Presidential elections the
   Republican candidate has consistently received over 60% of the
   vote.^[84][6]

[[85]edit] Geography

   Doniphan County is located in the northeastern corner of the stateit is
   bordered by [86]Nebraska to the north and [87]Missouri to the east.
   According to the [88]U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of
   397 square miles (1,028 km), of which 392 square miles (1,016 km) is
   land and 5 square miles (13 km), or 1.23%, is water.^[89][7]

[[90]edit] Geographic features

   The [91]Missouri River defines the border in the north and east. Eight
   [92]barge lines travel the [93]river, and a Port Authority is located
   across the river in [94]Saint Joseph, [95]Missouri. The river provides
   much of the [96]water for the eastern part of the county. Interior
   cities, such as [97]Troy and [98]Highland, receive their [99]water from
   underground wells. The [100]Wolf River flows through western portions
   of the county and north into the Missouri River.

[[101]edit] Major highways

   The only major [102]highway serving the county is [103]U.S. Highway 36,
   an east/west route traveling through St. Joseph. Troy, [104]Elwood, and
   [105]Wathena lie along this route. Kansas state highways [106]K-7,
   [107]K-20, [108]K-120, [109]K-137, and [110]K-238 serve other areas of
   the county. K-7 has been designated a [111]scenic byway. (See the
   [112]map below.)

[[212]edit] Colleges and universities

   [213]Highland Community College
          This was the first [214]college established in the state when
          the Highland University [215]charter was granted by the
          Territorial Legislature in 1858. Over time the college lost its
          affiliation with the [216]Presbyterian Church and changed its
          name several times before becoming a regional rural
          [217]community college. ([218]Web site)

[[219]edit] Points of interest

   Native American Heritage Museum, 2 miles east of [220]Highland
          Originally a Presbyterian Mission built in 1845 to educate
          [221]Iowa and Missouri [222]Sac and Fox children, the museum was
          rehabilitated to showcase the arts and history of the emigrant
          tribes in northeastern Kansas. ([223]Web site)

   Nelson Rodgers House, in [224]Troy
          Built in 1856, this one-and-a-half story center-gable house
          constructed of hand-hewn timbers is the first and oldest
          remaining house in Troy.

   Four-state Lookout, in [225]White Cloud
          This viewing platform provides a panoramic view of the
          [226]Missouri River valley, including [227]Kansas,
          [228]Missouri, [229]Nebraska, and (possibly) [230]Iowa.

   Townsite of Old Doniphan
          On [231]July 4, [232]1804 the [233]Lewis and Clark Expedition
          camped near an uninhabited Kanza Indian village on Independence
          Creek. The former town of [234]Doniphan was established in the
          vicinity of the campsite.
