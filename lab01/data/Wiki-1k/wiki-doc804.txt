   Ecole Oxford School is a [17]Canadian school in [18]Halifax, Nova
   Scotia. The school's current principal is Joe Morrison, former
   principal of [19]Highland Park Junior High.

   An October 24th, 2006 article by the now-defunct, Halifax [20]Daily
   News, described Oxford School as 'Just going through pure hell'. This
   was commented by a parent of a student who was pulled from the Junior
   High portion of the school prior to the article's public release. The
   article involved the testimonies of other parents and a small number of
   students. The release of the article would later instigate further
   observation by the [21]Halifax Regional School Board on the school. The
   article wished to not shift blame to the students themselves, rather
   place blame solely on administration.

   The article was met with harsh criticism by both the Oxford School
   administration and the various interviewees who claimed of misquoted or
   doctored testimonies. The Oxford School administration responded by
   making note of the newspaper's obvious bias view. This attack on the
   school would correspond to an apparent grudge with Oxford School. The
   article would later be followed by string of minor mentions in
   unrelated articles of Oxford's apparent, dubious reputation.

   The school plays host to multiple Sports Teams

   - Volleyball - Basketball - Badminton - Soccer - Track and Field -
   Cross Country - Softball - Hockey
