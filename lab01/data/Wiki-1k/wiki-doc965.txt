   Edwardian Musical Comedies are those British [8]musical theatre shows
   from the period between the 1890s, when [9]Gilbert and Sullivan began
   to lose their dominance, to the rise of the American musicals by
   [10]George Gershwin, [11]Cole Porter and [12]Jerome Kern following the
   [13]First World War.

[[19]edit] Description of the genre

   Edwardian musicals span the late [20]Victorian era and capture the
   optimism, energy and good humour of the new century and the
   [21]Edwardian era. The [22]Gaiety Theatre's well-loved [23]burlesques
   were coming to an end, and so were the run of phenomenally successful
   [24]Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Light romantic [25]comic operas like
   [26]Dorothy showed that audiences were ready for something new.

   The first Edwardian musical comedy was [27]In Town (1892), and the last
   was, perhaps, [28]The Maid of the Mountains (1916).^[29][1] According
   to critic Andrew Lamb, "The British Empire and America began to fall
   for the appeal of the [Edwardian] musical comedy from the time when A
   Gaiety Girl was taken on a world tour in 1894."^[30][2] The major
   composers of the genre were [31]Sidney Jones ([32]The Geisha), [33]Ivan
   Caryll ([34]Our Miss Gibbs), [35]Howard Talbot ([36]A Chinese
   Honeymoon), [37]Leslie Stuart ([38]Florodora), [39]Paul Rubens
   ([40]Miss Hook of Holland) and, most popular of all, [41]Lionel
   Monckton ([42]The Quaker Girl). The shows were a mixture of the
   prosaic, many being set amongst the working class of London, and the
   exotic, with most of the [43]British Empire appearing in one or another
   of these shows. Often, they were both, featuring stolid British types
   and their misunderstandings and adventures with strange 'Johnny
   Foreigners'. Generally, the book, [44]lyrics and music were each
   written by different people, which was a first for the musical stage,
   although now this is the usual way of doing things.

   The chief glories of Edwardian musical comedies lie in their musical
   scores. At their best, these combined the delicacy and sophistication
   of operetta with the robust tunefulness of the musical hall. [47]The
   Arcadians is generally regarded as the masterpiece of the genre^[48][3]
   The composers were Monckton and Talbot, both at the height of their
   powers (which makes Talbot's frequent omission from the credits even
   more iniquitous). The story, about the havoc wreaked when truth-telling
   Arcadians arrive in corrupt London, neatly parallels the position of
   Edwardian musical comedies in theatrical history, with
   [49]operetta-singing Arcadians, representing the past, meeting with
   [50]music hall-singing Londoners, representing the future. It is this
   tension that makes the shows of this period so enjoyable:
   sophistication with the common touch.

   Edwardian musical comedies were frequently built around a resident
   company of artists, as the [51]Savoy Operas had been, which included a
   number of the greatest stars of the musical stage - including such
   actresses as [52]Marie Tempest, [53]Gertie Millar, [54]Lily Elsie,
   [55]Ellaline Terriss and [56]Phyllis Dare, leading men such as
   [57]Hayden Coffin, [58]Harry Grattan and [59]Rutland Barrington, and
   comics such as [60]George Grossmith, Jr., [61]Huntley Wright and
   [62]Edmund Payne.
   [63]George Edwardes

   The first theatres to host these shows were [64]The Gaiety and
   [65]Daly's Theatre, both presided over by [66]George 'The Guv'nor'
   Edwardes, the [67]Cameron Mackintosh of the Edwardian stage. American
   producer [68]Charles Frohman, and actor-managers like [69]Seymour Hicks
   and [70]George Grossmith, Jr. were responsible for numerous other
   shows. Scores were constantly refreshed and re-arranged, often by a
   number of different composers and lyricists, to keep audiences coming
   back. Important writers included [71]Adrian Ross, [72]Harry Greenbank,
   [73]Percy Greenbank, [74]Owen Hall, and [75]Oscar Asche.

   The Edwardian musical comedy was very much a British phenomenon, but
   some of the shows repeated their success abroad, both in America and in
   Europe. Most notable among these was [76]The Geisha, which proved even
   more popular on the European continent than [77]The Mikado or
   [78]Dorothy had.^[79][4]
