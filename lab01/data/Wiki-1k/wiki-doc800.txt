Echo suppressor

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   An echo suppressor (sometimes "acoustic echo suppressor" / AES) is a
   [9]telecommunications device used to reduce the [10]echo heard on long
   [11]telephone [12]circuits, particularly circuits that traverse
   [13]satellite links. Echo suppressors were first developed in the 1950s
   in response to the first use of satellites for telecommunications, but
   they have since been largely supplanted by better performing cancellers
   [14]Acoustic Echo Cancelling

   Echo suppressors work by detecting if there is a voice signal going in
   one direction on a circuit, and then inserting a great deal of loss in
   the other direction. Usually the echo suppressor at the far-end of the
   circuit adds this loss when it detects voice coming from the near-end
   of the circuit. This added loss prevents the speaker from hearing his
   own voice.

   While effective, this approach leads to several problems:
     * Double-talk: It is fairly normal in conversation for both parties
       to speak at the same time, at least briefly. Because each echo
       suppressor will then detect voice energy coming from the far-end of
       the circuit, the effect would ordinarily be for loss to be inserted
       in both directions at once, effectively blocking both parties. To
       prevent this, echo suppressors can be set to detect voice activity
       from the near-end speaker and to fail to insert loss (or insert a
       smaller loss) when both the near-end speaker and far-end speaker
       are talking. This, of course, temporarily defeats the primary
       effect of having an echo suppressor at all.

     * Clipping: Since the echo suppressor is alternately inserting and
       removing loss, there is frequently a small delay when a new speaker
       begins talking that results in clipping the first syllable from
       that speaker's speech.

     * Dead-set: If the far-end party on a call is in a noisy environment,
       the near-end speaker will hear that background noise while the
       far-end speaker is talking, but the echo suppressor will suppress
       this background noise when the near-end speaker starts talking. The
       sudden absence of the background noise gives the near-end user the
       impression that the line has gone dead.

   Echo suppressors cause effects that are frustrating for both parties to
   a call, although they do effectively deal with the echo. In response to
   this, [15]AT&T [16]Bell Labs developed echo canceler theory in the
   early 1960s, which then resulted in laboratory echo cancelers in the
   late 1960s and commercial echo cancelers in the 1970s.

   In modern times, the main use of an AES (over an AEC) lies in the
   [17]VoIP sector. This is primarily because AECs require a fast hardware
   (MHz), usually in the from of a [18]Digital signal processor (DSP). For
   the PC market, and especially for the embedded VoIP market, this cost
   in MHZ comes at a premium. On embedded platforms, it is not-unusual to
   find a [19]Wideband [20]CODEC (such as [21]AMR-WB / [22]G.722)
   incorporated in place of an AEC. This said, many (embedded) VoIP
   solutions do have a fully functional AEC.

   Examples of AES in VoIP include: "X-Ten Eyebeam", [23]X-Lite and
   [24]Skype.
