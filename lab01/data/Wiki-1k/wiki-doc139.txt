   Saint Dominic de la Calzada (or Dominic of the Causeway; [17]Spanish:
   Santo Domingo de la Calzada) ([18]May 12, [19]1019 - 1109) was a
   [20]saint from a cottage in [21]Burgos very close to [22]La Rioja. Born
   Domingo Garca in [23]Viloria de Rioja, he was the son of a peasant
   named Ximeno Garca. His mother was named Orodulce.^[24][2]

   He repeatedly tried to join the [25]Benedictine order at Valvanera and
   [26]San Milln de la Cogolla, but was turned away. He then became a
   [27]hermit in the forests near [28]Ayuela, near the present-day town of
   [29]Santo Domingo de la Calzada, until 1039.^[30][2] In 1039, he began
   working with Gregory IV of Ostia (Gregorio), [31]bishop of Ostia, who
   had been sent to [32]Calahorra as a [33]papal envoy to combat a plague
   of [34]locusts that afflicted [35]Navarre and [36]La Rioja.^[37][3]

   Gregory ordained Dominic a priest.^[38][2] They built together a wooden
   bridge over the [39]Oja River to help [40]pilgrims on the [41]Way of
   St. James. Gregory died in 1044, and Dominic returned to Ayuela, where
   he began developing the area. He cleared trees, cultivated the earth,
   and began to build a paved causeway (in Spanish, calzada), which served
   as an alternate route to the traditional [42]Roman causeway between
   [43]Logroo and [44]Burgos. Dominics causeway became the principal route
   between [45]Njera and [46]Redecilla del Camino.^[47][3]

   To better the conditions of the pilgrims that began to use his new
   causeway, he replaced the wooden bridge that he had built with Gregory
   with one made of stone, and constructed a building that was at once
   [48]hospital, well, and church, which attended to the needs of the
   travelers. Today, it is the Casa del Santo, which is a used as a
   [49]hostel by modern day pilgrims.^[50][3]

[[57]edit] Dominic and Alfonso VI

   [58]Alfonso VI of Castile annexed La Rioja in 1076 and seeing that
   Dominics efforts contributed to the Castilianization of the region,
   decided to support him and his projects. He visited Dominic in 1090 and
   thereafter Dominic, assisted by his follower Juan de Ortega, began
   construction on a church dedicated to [59]Christ and the [60]Virgin
   Mary. This was consecrated by the [61]bishop of Calahorra in
   1106.^[62][3]^[63][2]

   The town of Santo Domingo de la Calzada began as a few houses built
   around the hermitage of the saint in his lifetime. At this death in
   1109, the village had grown in population. Dominic's church, later the
   [64]Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada, was where he was buried,
   and it was elevated to the rank of cathedral after being placed in the
   jurisdiction of the [65]Diocese of Calahorra in the 1230s.

[[66]edit] Miracles

   Miracles are attributed to Dominic, among them the healing of a
   [67]French [68]knight who had been possessed by the [69]devil and who
   was freed of his affliction by visiting the [70]sepulcher of the saint.
   Another concerns the healing of a German pilgrim named Bernard in the
   fifteenth century, who was cured of an affliction of the eyes by
   visiting the saints tomb. Another concerns the healing of a blind
   [71]Norman who was cured when he visited the cathedral.^[72][3]

   The most famous miracle, however, concerns that of the rooster and the
   chicken, which is said to have taken place at Santo Domingo de la
   Calzada.^[73][4] The story goes that in the 14th century, a German
   18-year old named Hugonell, from [74]Xanten, goes on pilgrimage to
   [75]Santiago de Compostela with his parents. A Spanish girl at the
   hostel where they were staying makes sexual advances toward Hugonell;
   Hugonell denies her advances. Angry at this, the girl hides a silver
   cup in the Germans bag and then informs the authorities that the youth
   had taken it. Hugonell is sentenced to the [76]gallows, in accordance
   with the laws of [77]Alfonso X of Castile.

   The parents sadly decide to examine their sons body, still hanging on
   the gallows, but suddenly hear his voice he tells them that Saint
   Dominic has saved his life. His parents quickly make their way to
   Santiago de Compostela to see the magistrate. The magistrate, who is at
   the time eating dinner, remarks: Your son is as alive as this rooster
   and chicken that I was feasting on before you interrupted me. And in
   that moment, the two birds jump from the plate and begin to sing and
   crow happily.^[78][4]

[[79]edit] Analysis of the story of Dominic's miracle

   The first element of the tale, that of a hanged pilgrim, is found in
   many collections of miracles, with the salvation from death of the
   victim attributed to not only Dominic, but also to [80]Saint James the
   Great, or to the [81]Virgin Mary, with the story taking place in
   various cities.^[82][5] Versions of the tale are found in the Milagros
   de Nuestra Seora by [83]Gonzalo de Berceo (Miracle No. 6), the 175th
   [84]Cantiga de Santa Mara by Alfonso X, and in the [85]Codex
   Calixtinus.^[86][5] The second part of the tale, the miracle of the
   dancing roasted chicken and rooster, is unique to Santo Domingo de la
   Calzada,^[87][5], though the notion can be found in [88]folklore
   concerning the mythical land of [89]Cockaigne, "where grilled geese fly
   directly into one's mouth,"^[90][6] or otherwise move about on their
   own accord. No, the partents of Hugpnell went to Santiago and it was on
   their return that the miracle of the white cock and hen occurred.

[[91]edit] Veneration

   Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.

   In memory of Dominic's miracle, a rooster and chicken, with white
   feathers, are kept alive at the cathedral all year round (they are
   called descendants of the original birds who miraculously danced even
   though roasted)^[92][5]; they are maintained by means of donations and
   a different rooster and chicken are switched each month. The pairs of
   roosters and chickens, when they are not at the cathedral, are kept in
   a [93]chicken coop maintained by the Cofrada de Santo Domingo
   (Confraternity of Santo Domingo), called the Gallinero de Santo Domingo
   de la Calzada. A wayside shrine (hornacina) built in 1445 holds a
   [94]relic associated with the miracle: a piece of wood from the gallows
   from which Hugonell was hanged.

   The pilgrims gathered the feathers of these favored birds, or they got
   them from the priest, and they would affix them to their hats.^[95][5]
   It was also said that if the birds ate breadcrumbs directly from the
   end of the pilgrims staff that the pilgrim would arrive safely in
   Compostela.^[96][5]

   The German pilgrim Hermann Knig (15th century) claims to have seen the
   room where the roasted birds began to sing and dance; other documents
   written by pilgrims state that Hugonells shirt had been conserved by
   the church of Santo Domingo and that the gallows themselves were
   conserved there as well. These artifacts are now lost.^[97][5]

   A verse commemorating this miracle runs: Santo Domingo de la Calzada /
   Donde cant la gallina despus de asada.^[98][7]^[99][4]
