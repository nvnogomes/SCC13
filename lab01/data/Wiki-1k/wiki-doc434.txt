Blackthorn Cider

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

     (Redirected from [6]Dry Blackthorn)

   Blackthorn Cider is a processed commercial [9]cider produced by Matthew
   Clark plc. Previously it was known as Blackthorn Dry or Dry
   Blackthorn,. It is sold in a variety of forms, commonly being served
   [10]draught in pubs or being sold in 440ml cans or two-litre bottles in
   shops or supermarkets.

   The cider is mass-produced using non-traditional methods, and so does
   not fit the definition of 'real cider' set by the [11]Campaign for Real
   Ale [12][1]. Where traditional cider is made with whole pressed apples
   fermented by the wild yeasts present on the skins, Blackthorn contains
   apple concentrate, sugar and sweeteners and is fermented with a
   controlled yeast strain.

   The cider is produced at the Taunton Cider site on the [13]A37 in
   [14]Shepton Mallet ([15]Mendip District, [16]Somerset, [17]England).
   Matthew Clark plc, the UK division of [18]Constellation Brands Inc.,
   acquired Blackthorn when it bought Taunton Cider in 1995. The recipe
   was soon changed, making the taste sweeter and raising the alcohol
   content to bring the product more into line with the market leader
   [19]Strongbow. Another, sweeter, variety, called Blackthorn Red, was
   trialled in the UK in the early 1990s but was withdrawn a year later
   due to lack of interest.
