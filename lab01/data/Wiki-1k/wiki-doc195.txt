[[61]edit] History

   It is one of Doncaster's most architecturally important buildings. It
   was built by architect [62]Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1858. It
   replaced a 12th century [63]Norman building that burnt down on the last
   day of February 1853. It was described by Sir [64]John Betjeman as
   "Victorian Gothic at its very best".

   Amongst its treasures are a clock by Dent (the same designer the Palace
   of Westminster Clock more usually known as Big Ben) and a spectacular 5
   manual [65]organ by the renowned German organ builder [66]Edmund
   Schulze (1824-1877).

[[86]edit] The 1862 Schulze Organ

[[87]edit] Rising from the Ashes

   The [88]medieval [89]Parish Church of St. George, Doncaster (now
   Minster) possessed a fine Harris [90]organ of 1739-40. This instrument
   was praised by John Stanley who declared every pipe in the reed stops
   to be worth its weight in silver. It grew from an original
   specification of some 24 stops to one of 51 stops and was reputed to be
   the largest organ in England except for York Minster, thanks due to the
   tireless efforts of Jeremiah Rogers (organist 1835-1879), who paid for
   much of the work himself. The organ had only just been relocated from
   the West Gallery to the [91]Chancel and its pedal extended to 32 pitch,
   when it was consumed by fire along with the entire building on 28th
   February 1853.

   The leading architect of the day, Sir George Gilbert Scott was
   commissioned to rebuild the church, a task which he completed in only 4
   years. Consecrated in 1858, the new church is the most cathedral like
   of Scotts parish churches and is crowned by a magnificent bell tower
   170 feet in height.

   Naturally Jeremiah Rogers was desirous of commissioning an organ worthy
   of Scotts new church and set out to acquire the best organ that could
   be obtained anywhere in the world. Rogers made many visits around
   Europe inspecting famous organs, often in the company of his friend
   E.J. Hopkins (organist of the Temple Church).

[[92]edit] J F Schulze and Sons

   Johann Friedrich Schulze was born at Milbitz near Paulinzella,
   Thuringia, in 1794, and began building organs there in 1825. His first
   organs were for Horba (10 stops) and Milbitz (21 stops). In 1825 he
   moved to Paulinzella, where his business increased and he undertook
   substantial contracts at Solingen and Bremen [93]Cathedral. In 1851 he
   exhibited an organ at the Great Exhibition, reputedly at the express
   invitation of Prince Albert, himself a native of Thuringia. One of
   three foreign organs on exhibition, Schulzes instrument was a modest
   two manual of 15 stops. Subsequently transferred to [94]Northampton
   Town Hall, it was later destroyed. It presented several features which
   at the time were new to this country and aroused much interest
   resulting in the award of a prize medal. The specification was as
   follows:

   CAPTION: Pedal Organ

   Bordun (Gt) 16
   Octav Bass  8
   Posaune     16

   E. J. Hopkins in the first edition of Groves Dictionary of Music and
   Musicians comments on Schulzes exhibition organ and describes the
   Lieblich Gedackt as the invention of Schulze.singularly beautiful in
   quality of tone. The Flauto Traverso he describes thus double length in
   the upper part.the pipes being of wood bored and turned to a
   cylindrical shape were in reality so many actual flutes. In addition he
   noted that the organ possessed two excellent free reeds.

   The exhibition organ did not by itself produce any orders for the firm
   and it may have been Hopkins personal familiarity with some of the
   German instruments which finally clinched the [96]Doncaster commission
   for Schulze. Hopkins visited the 1852 Schulze organ at Bremen Cathedral
   and was later to recall:

   The effect of the organ was exceedingly solemn, grand or soothing,
   according to whether I used the 16 and 8ft diapasons, the full organ,
   or the flutes and gedackts. In fact, I never at any organ, in the whole
   course of my life, felt myself under such a great enchantment. Indeed
   the excitement was so great that I had two or three times to leave the
   church in the most urgent state.

   It was surely no coincidence that when writing in The Organ, its
   History and Construction (E J Hopkins and E F Rimbault, Third Edition,
   London 1877) Hopkins describes a specification for an ideal 4 manual
   organ of 87 stops which bears a remarkably close resemblance to
   Doncaster.

   The order was placed in 1857, originally for a 3 manual instrument.
   With the death of Johann Friedrich Schulze (1793-1858), it was left to
   his son [97]Heinrich Edmund Schulze (1824-1878) to take over as the
   innovative and creative force within the firm (see plate I). Edmund
   Schulze soon persuaded Rogers to enlarge the specification to a 5
   manual instrument which was to be the largest church organ in the
   country with 94 registers over 5 manuals including 25 stops on the
   pedal department, exceeded only by Williss organ for St. Georges Hall,
   [98]Liverpool of 1851.

   In 1860 the main consignment of parts from Germany arrived at Hull.
   Much of the construction took place in the church itself where Edmund
   Schulze together with 4 or 5 men work on the project for 2 years. One
   observer reputedly noted that the massive 32 foot principal was
   cleverly made from the wooden packing cases of the shipment itself!
   According to Rogers, Schulze spent 3 weeks regulating and finishing the
   mixtures working from the early hours of the morning until midnight,
   and sleeping on the bellows before resuming his labours. The new organ
   was dedicated at a service on 24th September 1862.

   As a result of the publicity of the Doncaster organ, many other orders
   followed, especially in the North of England, including St. Mary, Tyne
   Dock (1862), Meanwood Towers (1869, subsequently moved to Harrogate and
   finally to St. Bartholomew, [99]Armley), St. Peter, Hindley (1873) and
   St. Peter, [100]Harrogate (1879).

   Doncaster was to be the largest organ the firm were to build. Prior to
   Doncaster, Schulzes largest contract had been the 80 stop 4 manual
   instrument in the Marienkirche, Lbeck, completed in 1854 (destroyed in
   1942), often regarded as a sister instrument to Doncaster. After the
   death of Edmund Schulze in 1878, the firm ceased trading the following
   year.

[[101]edit] Innovations of Edmund Schulze

   The Doncaster Schulze contained a number of technical innovations. Huge
   pedal slider soundboards were built to enable each pedal stop to be
   available at two pitches, thus enabling an independent pedal section of
   some 25 registers including 2 mixtures, 4 mutations and 8 reeds, well
   able to support both classical and romantic repertoire. In terms of
   sheer number of stops, though perhaps not in ranks, it exceeded its
   rival at St. Georges Hall, Liverpool.

   In addition to the provision of conventional beating reeds, Schulze
   provided two free reeds, the pedal Contra Posaune 32 and Posaune 16.
   Doncaster possesses the only known example of this stop at 32 pitch in
   England.

   In order to obtain more definition in his pedal department, Schulze
   provided the first known example of a wooden 16 Violone, fitted with a
   box mouth to steady the speech.

   Other innovations included in the instrument were the triangular
   section Hohl Flute 8 on the Great division (see plate IV) and the use
   of wooden harmonic flutes. Stop names and characteristics unfamiliar in
   this country included the Quintaten, Lieblich Gedackt, Gemshorn, Dolce,
   Terpodian and of course the famed wide mouthed Schulze diapason. The
   Flauto Traverso 8 and the Flauto Traverso 4, as noted by Hopkins,
   consist of cylindrical open flute pipes, made from Beech, bored and
   turned on a lathe (see plates II & VII).

   The chief glory of the Doncaster Schulze is its bold Great Flue Chorus
   which extends from its manual 32 to no fewer than 14 ranks of mixture
   (the Swell having to be content with a mere 12 mixture ranks).

[[102]edit] Abbott & Smith

   The original foot blowing gear required the services of four men to
   raise sufficient wind (see plate III). With the advent of modern
   technology, it was unsurprising that in 1894 the Leeds firm of Abbott &
   Smith replaced it with a Shipley gas engine and compressor. At the same
   time a new [103]console was provided with a pneumatic stop action. The
   Schulze key actions and the borrowed Solo manual remained. They also
   converted the pedal action to pneumatic operation, with the new supply
   of wind allowing the addition of thumb pistons and other gadgetry.

   The story is told of the loss of the choir mixture arising from the
   somewhat ill advised attempt of a virger to search for a gas leak with
   a naked flame. This action resulted in an explosion causing the loss of
   the original North Transept window and supposedly the Choir mixture.
   Curiously there was no apparent sign of damage to the case pipes or any
   other ranks. A probably more plausible explanation is that Edmund
   Schulze substituted the 2 rank Flauto Gambe in place of the Mixture
   originally specified in his fathers quotation.

[[104]edit] Norman & Beard and later works

   In 1910 the only significant changes were made to the instrument with
   the replacement of Schulzes borrowed solo manual with an independent
   department in its own swell box. Another new swell-box was provided for
   the echo organ making it in the words of Magnus Black inaudible above
   the traffic except in the early hours of the morning. The echo swell
   box shutters have since been removed! A large leathered No1 Diapason,
   standing in its own separate chest, was added to the Great at this
   time. It was removed in 1959.

   The sum total of the Norman & Beard changes was the addition of 8 new
   stops (i.e. the Solo division and the Swell Celestes). It is believed
   that the wind pressure to the Great Reeds was increased, but no other
   changes were made to the voicing.

   In 1935 J W Walker & Sons provided a new electro- pneumatic action and
   radiating terraced stop tab console on the south side of the choir (see
   plate VI). Further work was carried out by Walkers in 1959 including
   the replacement of the original pedal chests, which after 100 years
   service were no longer reliable. The Walker console was removed in 1999
   when Andrew Carter installed a replacement 5 manual drawstop console
   built by Nicholson. The blowing plant and Great action were overhauled
   at this time.

[[105]edit] Critical Appreciation

   The organ at Doncaster Minster is the Magnum Opus of Edmund Schulze and
   is the largest instrument that the firm produced. One of the largest
   organs in Europe, it is no exaggerated claim that this single
   instrument revolutionised the British organ and led to a complete
   reappraisal of the classical organ. Doncaster became, and still is, a
   place of pilgrimage for musicians and organ builders alike.

   One example of its significance was the reaction of the Victorian
   architect, T.C. Lewis, who became a follower of Schulze and set up on
   his own account as an organ builder. Lewis, whose famous instrument at
   Southwark Cathedral owes much to Doncaster, had high praise for the
   Doncaster instrument:

   anything finer it is, I believe, impossible to imagineit is by far the
   grandest instrument I have ever heard.

   Dr. Nicholas Thistlethwaite in The Making of the Victorian Organ
   Cambridge 1990, states:

   The Doncaster organ proved to be one of the two most influential organs
   built in England during the second half of the century. Schulzes work
   and especially his monumental organ at Doncaster, established a new
   ideal. His later English work was to be received with equal respect,
   but it was Doncaster that showed the way.

   The historical importance of the Doncaster instrument to the present
   day lies in the fact that it was sufficiently good to escape the almost
   continual rebuilding that similar instruments of the period underwent.
   Sadly similar instruments at St. Georges Hall Liverpool, York Minster
   and Birmingham Town Hall found themselves undergoing regular rebuilds
   to keep up to date with the latest organ fashion.

   A number of works have been written specifically for the Doncaster
   Schulze; these include Francis Jacksons Fourth Organ Sonata and a Trio
   Sonata by Magnus Black (organist 1957-1995).

   Magnus Black summed up its musical significance thus:

   The classical revival.led to an appreciation of well-balanced manual
   choruses and independent pedal departmentsThese are among the features
   of the Doncaster Schulze. The German Romantic organ never lost its
   connections with its classical predecessor and many important features
   relate it to the organs of Bachs time.
