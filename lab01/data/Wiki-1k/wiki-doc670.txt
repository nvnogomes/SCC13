[[47]edit] Current Ride

   The current ride, at Universal Studios Florida, has guests begin by
   entering a sound stage.

[[48]edit] Exterior Queue

   The exterior queue is themed to a sound stage where E.T. is being
   filmed. TV monitors above guests' heads display the filmmakers
   disscussing their experience on creating the film as well as E.T.
   trivia. There are also E.T. posters from the film's 20th Anniversary
   re-release on display near the end of the queue. Guests are then
   ushered into the pre-show room.

[[49]edit] Pre-Show

   Before going into the interior queue, [50]Steven Spielberg appears on
   TV screens above us and tells us that E.T.'s teacher Botanicus needs
   E.T. to come to his home world, "The Green Planet" because the planet
   is dying. Only E.T.'s magical healing touch can save the planet, so it
   is up to the guests to bring him home. He also tells the guests that
   you make your journey on bikes, and that you need a "Interplanetary
   Passport" to get there. The guests then enter a second room where they
   give their name to one of Speilberg's assistants which is programmed
   into a card, that is used later in the ride.

[[51]edit] Interior Queue

   The interior queue is a forest setting where it is established that the
   police are looking for E.T. Guests then board the ride vehicle which is
   a car suspended from a track. E.T.'s teacher Botanicus is seen pleading
   for his return.

[[52]edit] Ride

   Each individual seat is a bicycle, whose handles come down as the lap
   bar. The bike in the middle of the front row contains E.T. The vehicles
   travel past NASA and police officials who give chase and try to arrest
   the riders. As they are about to be caught, a police car appears out of
   no where and just as you are about to hit it, the bicycles begin to fly
   over the city and then into outerspace. From on your bikes, you can see
   the miniture city below, including real moving cars and even a football
   stadium. The bike is then transported to a kind of portal area with
   flashing lights which, when finally turned around, arrives at the Green
   Planet. Then guests encounter Botanicus who urges the visitors to save
   E.T.'s friends. E.T.'s healing touch travels through the planet,
   reviving his friends and beginning a celebration with baby E.T.s. This
   lasts for about 3 minutes, and is a huge contrast to the begining; the
   begining was dark and scary, and this party of the ride is light and
   colourful, with spurting water and singing. At the end, guests pass an
   [53]animatronic E.T. who thanks them all by the name they gave to the
   travel agents.^[54][1]

[[55]edit] Attraction Facts

   [56]Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please
   [57]relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or
   articles. (October 2008)
     * The rides at both [58]Universal Studios Florida and [59]Universal
       Studios Japan are still in operation. The ride is located in
       [60]Woody Woodpecker's KidZone in Florida, and in the [61]Hollywood
       area in Japan. The ride at [62]Universal Studios Hollywood, which
       opened on June 12, 1991, was closed March 14, 2003 to make room for
       [63]Revenge of the Mummy.

     * For a short time, an unauthorized golden E.T. statue was placed by
       a crew member in the treasure room of the Revenge of the Mummy
       attraction as a tribute to the former tenant of the building at
       [64]Universal Studios Hollywood. This did not last long.

     * After the closing of the [65]Hollywood ride, [66]Steven Spielberg
       told Universal that they were not permitted to close the
       [67]Florida and [68]Japan versions. Universal agreed, thus it is
       highly unlikely that the [69]Florida and [70]Japan versions will be
       replaced anytime soon. The ride is rumored to appear in the
       upcoming [71]Universal Studios Singapore park when completed in
       2010.

     * In November 2004 on the attraction at [72]Universal Studios Japan,
       a 35-year-old woman from Osaka Prefecture, Japan suffered nerve
       damage in her right wrist, resulting in the loss of use of two of
       her fingers and ultimately losing her job. This occurred when her
       hand got stuck in a safety bar as an employee pulled it down to
       secure it. The woman sued the park and received 14 million in an
       out-of-court settlement.

     * The attraction at [73]Universal Studios Florida originally featured
       a different pre-show which ran from 1990-2002. During this
       pre-show, [74]Steven Spielberg is in a movie theater watching
       [75]E.T. and informs us that we have volunteered to be actors in a
       sequel to the film. The original pre-show was discontinued, because
       Speilberg wanted to change it for the 20th Anniversary. It should
       also be noted that the original pre-show was projected onto a large
       screen, while the current one is seen from multiple TV monitors.
     * Original music: [76]John Williams
