[[36]edit] Plot

   Wheezer and Dorothy's mother had been dead a few years and their father
   remarried a mean woman, who had a bratty son named Spud aka Sherwood.
   Their father seemingly left them recently to live with their mean
   stepmother and her equally rotton son.

   A typical day begins with Wheezer's dog Pete coming into his berdroom
   from an open window to play with him. Sherwood tells on Wheezer who
   promptly gets a spanking. Wheezer cries and his stepmother states that
   he deserves it for letting pete in. She also explains that Sherwood is
   allowed to play with his dog Nero in in the house because Nero is a
   pedigreed animal while Pete is just an alley dog. She threatens to send
   Pete to the pound next time he is found in the house. Wheezer then
   punches Sherwood in the face and Sherwood screams and cries for his
   "mama". The mean stepmother then gives Wheezer another spanking
   threatening to throw him and Dorothy into an orphanage if their "good
   for nothing" father does not show up soon. She then leaves to go
   downtown and tells Wheezer to not let Sherwood get dirty.

   After the stepmother leaves, Stymie arrives. Sherwood said that Stymie
   could not come in because his mother does not allow "colored people"
   inside. Wheezer and Dorothy are being fed mush while Sherwood his dog
   eat ham and eggs. Stymie comes in anyway and tells Sherwood that ham
   and eggs can talk and cons him into making more. Sherwood gets
   distracted and goes outside. Stymie, Wheezer, and Dorothy then enjoy
   the ham and eggs.

   Sherwood is then pushed into a well by his own dog Nero. He has Dickie
   get Wheezer. Wheezer and Stymie come out to see what the trouble is.
   They get Sherwood a rope after teasing him a little while. As they pull
   him up from the well, Sherwood states that he is telling mother about
   this. Wheezer then pushes him back in. Then as he pulls him out
   Sherwood swears he will keep this a secret. As soon as Sherwood gets
   his feet on the ground he says "I am too gonna tell Mama!!!" Wheezer
   stated that his dunking will be worth the whipping.

   Later, Sherwood goes to a neighbor's barn and finds a dead chicken that
   Nero killed. He then tells the owner, Mr. Brown, that Pete killed a
   chicken. Mr. Brown then attempts to shoot Pete but a police officer
   stops him. Pete is still sent to the pound because he is unlicensed.
   Wheezer cries and his aunt finds him and gives Wheezer money to get the
   dog out. She then tells Wheezer and Dorothy that their dad has been
   sick and she would be taking them to live with her in a nice place. As
   she takes Wheezer, Dorothy, and Pete to the car with their belongings,
   the mean stepmother gripes that their father was no good anyway and she
   was fed up with taking care of the children. The aunt then kicks the
   mean stepmother in the butt.

   The film closes when Wheezer says to Dorothy that he hates to leave
   Stymie, but unknown to them Stymie is riding on the back tire.

[[37]edit] Note

   This is ranked as one of the best Our gang films. The first several
   minutes were edited out of the syndicated Little Rascals television
   package in 1971 because of the maltreatment of children being
   portrayed. The unedited version was reinstated in 2001 and shown on
   [38]AMC from 2001-2003. Today, Dogs Is Dogs is one of about a dozen Our
   Gang films in the [39]public domain, as its copyright was not renewed
   in the 1980s.
